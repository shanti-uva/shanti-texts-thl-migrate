It\n                     became a great centre for studies in metaphysics, where, over the years,\n                     hundreds of monks studied. It was also a place where tantric meditation and\n                     rituals were commonly practised. However, the monastery soon began to decline,\n                     and did so for several generations. Later it was looked after by sPa ston &rsquo;Od\n                     gsal rgyal mtshan, a descendant of the sPa family. This master&rsquo;s main seat was\n                     at sMan gong in Shangs. His chief disciple was Zhang ston Ba thang pa. There\n                     then followed several masters, such as Zhang ston Tshul khrims blo ldan, Sum\n                     ston lHa &rsquo;bum, Sum ston &rsquo;Dul ba bzang po, Sum ston bZang po dpal, mKhas grub\n                     rGyal mtshan mchog legs of rMe&rsquo;u and Rong ston Shes rab &rsquo;od zer, all of whom\n                     were active in the monastery. The monastery was mainly maintained by the\n                     members of the rMe&rsquo;u family. There have been, altogether to date, forty\n                     descendants of the rMe&rsquo;u family down to the present rMe&rsquo;u Nyi zla dbang grags.\n                     The monastery was originally located east of bZang ri village and was destroyed\n                     during the Cultural Revolution. In 1982, its site was moved up to the top of\n                     the hill behind the village and was then rebuilt.</p>\n\n               \n\n               \n\n                  "},{"title":"4.
