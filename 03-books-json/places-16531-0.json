It consists of a single conterminous\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tresidential complex and a couple of small dependencies. The ruined buildings face east along a sharply inclined\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tslope. Although access from below is difficult, higher ground flanks the installation to the north, thus it is not\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tparticularly defendable. Its somewhat insecure position and general architectural composition are traits it shares\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin common with <span class=\"popular\">Gyammuk Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gyam smug mkhar</span> (A-68) and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"popular\">Rala Kharmar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ra la mkhar dmar</span> (see A-65). A fairly\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tclose cultural and temporal relationship is therefore probably indicated. The relatively long and regular 50-cm\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthick walls could only have supported wooden roofs. All outer walls are generally aligned in the cardinal\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdirections. No internal room partitions remain at the site. Structures have heavily mud-mortared (much of it is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnow gone) coursed-rubble walls composed of uncut pieces of limestone (20 cm to 40 cm in length). There are also\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\therringbone courses of masonry in a few walls.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>None was obtained.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Site elements","index":6,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Castle","index":7,"parent_index":6,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The complex has two main sectors: south and north.
