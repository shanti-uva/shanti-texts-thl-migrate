Later bsTan &rsquo;dzin kun\n                        khyabs transformed the hermitage into a monastery in 1887. As he was from\n                        dGa&rsquo; mal Monastery (No.208), the new monastery became a branch of dGa&rsquo; mal.\n                        The next master was sNang zhig sPrul sku (d.1937)<a href=\"#n60\" name=\"nb60\" class=\"note\">60</a> who was regarded as a reincarnation of Nyi ma rig &rsquo;dzin of sNang\n                        zhig dNgul sku Monastery (No.201).

Tshul khrims bstan &rsquo;dzin (1918-1985)\n                        became the master of the monastery in 1982.
