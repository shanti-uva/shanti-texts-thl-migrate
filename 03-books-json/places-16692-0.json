There are 12 in situ gray and tan standing pillars of significant stature at <span class=\"popular\">Doring Lung Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo ring lung rdo ring</span>. They are heavily eroded, inclined at various angles and are host to orange climax lichen. The standing stones of <span class=\"popular\">Doring Lung Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo ring lung rdo ring</span> tend to have four uneven sides of more or less the same width.
