It is located right on the lakeshore, 2 km east of the opening to the <span class=\"popular\">Bar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bar</span> basin. Only a single rocky ridge separates it from\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"popular\">Bar Gi Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bar gyi mkhar</span> (A-104).

The accessibility of the site\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand the lack of breastworks or other signs of fortifications indicate that this installation was not a safehold.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLike ruins found on many other shorelines in Upper Tibet, <span class=\"popular\">Ribong Kharru</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ri bong mkhar ru</span>may have been an archaic religious\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcenter. Such facilities were often built on southern exposure outcrops, headlands and islands in the great lakes,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhich spread across the entire breadth of Upper Tibet.

The so-called <span class=\"popular emph\">khar</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mkhar</span> is comprised of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfoundations and fragmentary walls of four small buildings. These structures were made with 55-cm to 80-cm thick\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdry-mortar, random-work walls. These walls contain unhewn stones 15 cm to 60 cm in length. Mostly limestone blocks\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twere employed in construction, but some conglomerate and metamorphic stones were also used.
