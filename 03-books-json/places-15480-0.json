Now these caves have become holy sites to which Tibetans make pilgrimage.<\/p><p>According to the <em>Jianzha Gazetteer<\/em> (Ch. Jianzha Zhi) published by Jianzha County Government in 2003, Jianzha County was established in 1953 and is one of the four counties in Huangnan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province. Prior to the establishment of the county, Jianzha was under the administration of Guide Ting. An administrative system called Qianhu (a thousand households, Tib. <em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">khri dpon<\/span><\/em>) and Baihu (a hundred households, Tib. <em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">rgya dpon<\/span><\/em>) was used to exercise the administrative power over the area. This system was originally established by the Mongol khans and later adopted and used by the Ming and Qing dynasties to claim and exercise their control over the region. It remained effective until the Communist takeover of <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15348\">Amdo<\/span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"F15348\">a mdo<\/span><\/em>) in the early 1950s. After a long period of time, the system prevailed in <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15348\">Amdo<\/span>, and it became so pervasive that almost every village and community fell under the rule of either a Qianhu or Baihu, depending on the size. It is important to know that Qianhu and Baihu were essentially political titles given by the rulers (such as the Qing emperor) to powerful local Tibetans to rule the area. For example, <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Nangra P\u00f6npo<\/span> (<em><span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">snang ra dpon po<\/span><\/em>)\u00a0from <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15480\">Chentsa<\/span> received his Qianhu title from the Yongzheng Emperor in 1734<a>.<\/a>\u00a0<\/p><p>Moreover, all the Qianhu and Baihu title-holders were secular people, in contrast to the religious leaders who are well-known for being the dominant feature of the social and political landscape of Tibet. Before Communist rule, in <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15480\">Chentsa<\/span> there were four such local leaders: one Qianhu, the <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Nangra P\u00f6npo<\/span>, and three Baihu, including the <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kyareng P\u00f6npo<\/span>,\u00a0the <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kyaga<\/span> (<em><span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">skya rgya<\/span><\/em>) <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">P\u00f6npo<\/span>, and the <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kapuk<\/span> (<em><span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">rka pug<\/span><\/em>) <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">P\u00f6npo<\/span>. The two divisions of <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15480\">Chentsa<\/span> (\"<span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Chentsa\u00a0Nyisip<\/span>\") on either side of the river could join forces for important matters. For instance, the sixteen Tibetan clans of <span class=\"place\" title=\"F1159\">Bayen<\/span>\/ Hualong county joined with the \"Tibetan chieftain from <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15480\">Chentsa<\/span>\" (this must have included the <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Nangra P\u00f6npo<\/span>, who controlled portions of more than five counties) in resisting Chinese Communists from 1949 \"until May 1952, when an expedition of 10,000 PLA troops was mounted against them.\" (See <em>Tibet outside the TAR<\/em>,\u00a0 p. 2178 [citing June Teufel Dreyer: \"Ch'inghai\" p. 7] & pp. 1700-1 [citing <em>Qinghai lishi jiyao<\/em> (<em>Outline of Qinghai History<\/em>), p. 633; and <em>Jiefang Qinghai<\/em> (<em>Liberating Qinghai<\/em>), p. 503]; see also Mark Stevens unpublished article about the Nangra resistance, given at a Harvard conference on <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15348\">Amdo<\/span>.<\/p><p>As for religious leaders, the <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Zhapdrung Karpo<\/span> (<em><span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">zhabs drung dkar po<\/span><\/em>), <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Lamo Sertri<\/span> (<em><span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">lwa mo gser khri<\/span><\/em>, \"the Golden Throne-holder of <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Lamo<\/span> Monastery\"), and the <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kou Batsang<\/span> (<em><span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">ko'u ba tshang<\/span><\/em>)\u00a0were the important lamas with political titles in the area. In <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15480\">Chentsa<\/span>, the <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Zhapdrung Karpo<\/span>\u00a0is no doubt the highest lama. In 1558, Altan Khan\u2019s son and the royal family members extended an invitation to the 3<sup>rd<\/sup> Dalai Lama, who sent the first <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Zhapdrung Karpo<\/span>\u00a0as his emissary to the Kokonor region. The first <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Zhapdrung Karpo<\/span>\u00a0was born in an area called <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Lamo<\/span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">lwa mo<\/span><\/em>) in <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15355\">\u00dc<\/span>-<span class=\"place\" title=\"F15354\">Tsang<\/span> (<span class=\"place\" title=\"F15355\">dbus<\/span> <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15354\">gtsang<\/span>) and was a highly accomplished lama.

The Kangxi Emperor named the monastery <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Getsokling<\/span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">dge tshogs gling<\/span><\/em>). In addition to the <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Zhapdrung Karpo<\/span>, the <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Lamo Sertri<\/span>\u00a0is the other important lama at <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dechen<\/span> Monastery. He was one of the eight Qutughtu (Ch. Hutuketu) based in Beijing during the Qing Dynasty. The 5<sup>th<\/sup>\u00a0<span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Sertri<\/span>\u00a0was invited to the Qing court in Beijing and served as the Qianlong Emperor\u2019s lama. He was involved in building Yong he gong Temple, which is now popularly known as the Lama Temple in Beijing. The 1<sup>st<\/sup>\u00a0<span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Lamo Sertri<\/span>\u00a0was a reincarnation of <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Trichen Lodr\u00f6 Gyatso<\/span> (<em><span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">khri chen blo gros rgya mtsho<\/span><\/em>), who had his own series of reincarnation. It is interesting to note here that he was born to the brother of the 3<sup>rd<\/sup>\u00a0<span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Zhapdrung Karpo<\/span>\u00a0and studied at <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dechen<\/span> Monastery. He was later named <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Lamo Sertri<\/span>, who then began a new reincarnation series.<\/p><p>Before the Communist Party came to rule, the <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Zhapdrung Karpo<\/span>\u00a0in principle exercised administrative power over a large territory covering the present-day counties of Jianzha, Hualong, Guide, Tongde, and Guinan. There are 25 monasteries under him and many of his monasteries are located in these places. However, it is important to point out that there were local leaders such as the Qianhu and Baihu, who ruled their own places. It is true that the <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Zhapdrung Karpo<\/span>\u00a0received titles from Mongol Khans and Qing Emperors and played a key political role, but how he negotiated power with the local secular leaders is an interesting question to probe. In the historical sources regarding the <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Zhapdrung Karpo<\/span>, there is no mention of conflicts between him and the local leaders. Usually, his political role was limited to settling land disputes between the local leaders, who highly respected him as a lama. It is thus tempting to argue that he was able to deal with the issues successfully largely because of his religious influence, rather than the political power entitled to him. In fact one can argue that it was his religious influence that provided him political capital, which the Mongol Khans and Qing Emperors probably saw in him and used for their political ambitions in the region. Even today important lamas are still involved in settling the grassland disputes with which the government finds difficult to deal.<\/p><p>Actually the relationship between the <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Zhapdrung Karpo<\/span>\u00a0and the <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Nangra P\u00f6npo<\/span>\u00a0is an obscure one, despite the fact that in principle the lama had administrative power over a large territory, including the place that the <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">p\u00f6npo<\/span>\u00a0ruled. It is worth noting here that the <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Nangra P\u00f6npo<\/span>\u00a0received his title \u201cqianhu\u201d from the Qing emperor. In fact, no evidence indicates that the <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Nangra P\u00f6npo<\/span>\u00a0submitted to the <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Zhapdrung Karpo<\/span>\u00a0and took orders from him. According to the Jianzha Gazetteer, the <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Nangra P\u00f6npo<\/span>\u00a0was directly under the Xining Amban. Nevertheless, in one case the <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Nangra P\u00f6npo<\/span>\u00a0helped the lama settle a land dispute between his monastery, <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Gur<\/span>, and the neighboring community, <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kyareng<\/span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">skya reng<\/span><\/em>), which had its own Baihu leader.

That being said, the <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Nangra P\u00f6npo<\/span>\u00a0highly regarded the <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Zhapdrung Karpo<\/span>\u00a0as a religious leader.

Because of this he was commonly referred to as \"<span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Rongwo Nangso<\/span>\" (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">rong bo nang so<\/span><\/em>).

In 1876, the 6<sup>th<\/sup> <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Nangra P\u00f6npo<\/span>, <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Lhag\u00f6ntar<\/span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">lha mgon thar<\/span><\/em>), was born; he was known to be a pious person. He built <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Nangra<\/span> stupa and added walls around the temple of <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Nangra Serkhang<\/span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">snang ra gser khang<\/span><\/em>). He promoted religious practice and ritual in the villages under his rule. Even today these religious rituals are still practiced in these places. He died in 1943. The 7<sup>th<\/sup> Qianhu, <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Wangchen D\u00f6ndrup<\/span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">dbang chen don grub<\/span><\/em>), was born in 1904 and came to power in 1929, at the age of 25. He was famous for his resistance against the Communist rule in the early 1950s. Interestingly though, he served as the first leader (Ch. Xianzhang) of Jianzha County after he succumbed to the Chinese Communist Party.<\/p><p>Today, the <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Nangra Dronggy\u00e9<\/span> still functions as one coherent community, despite the fact that it is divided into four or five different townships. The traditional idea of the <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Nangra Dronggy\u00e9<\/span>\u00a0remains strong and people voice solidarity with it. One recent incident demonstrates this point. Approximately seven years ago, a fight broke out between some Tibetans and Muslims in Jianzha town, and eventually it turned into a violent conflict between the two ethnic groups and had to be settled with the involvement of the PLA soldiers from Lanzhou. After the incident took place all the communities that are traditionally associated with <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Nangra Dronggy\u00e9<\/span>\u00a0came together and prepared to fight as one whole against their longtime enemy, the Muslims across the river. Nangra people still claim that the land that the Muslims occupy now was once their territory and so feel strong animosity towards them. Therefore, in <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15480\">Chentsa<\/span>, there are frequent conflicts between the Tibetans and Muslims. (It would be interesting to study the relationship between the <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Nangra P\u00f6npo<\/span> and the Ma Family, who ruled Qinghai for 40 years and converted many Tibetans into Muslims. However, I have not found any material on it yet).<\/p><p>In addition to the <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Nangra Dronggy\u00e9<\/span>, there are other polities that are centered around major monasteries in <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15480\">Chentsa<\/span>. In the past, from time to time these polities clashed over land because they are adjacent to each other. One such polity was the <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Hormo Khaksum<\/span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">hor mo khag sum<\/span><\/em>, the \"three divisions of Hormo\"), who had their own leader. It is said that they had had a thousand households in the past, even though their leader, <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kyareng P\u00f6npo<\/span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">skya reng dpon po<\/span><\/em>), was only a Baihu. Before the Communist rule, the religious and political leader of <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Hormo Khak<\/span> was <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kou Batsang<\/span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ko\u2019u ba tshang<\/span><\/em>), who was the head lama of <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kou Ba<\/span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">ko'u ba<\/span><\/em>) Monastery. The monastery was founded in 1340, and it has received patronage from the areas known as <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Hormo Khaksum<\/span>, <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Ch\u00f6 Tsangma<\/span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">chos gtsang ma<\/span><\/em>) and <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Tsodruk<\/span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">tsho drug<\/span><\/em>). One of the early reincarnations of <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kou Ba<\/span> received the title \u201c<em>tsha gan no min han<\/em>.\u201d This is the only monastery in <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15480\">Chentsa<\/span> that is not associated with or subordinate to <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dechen<\/span> Monastery.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>In <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15480\">Chentsa<\/span> (including both the shady side and sunny side), there are 28 monasteries, tantric temples (<span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">nakkhang<\/span>,\u00a0<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">sngags khang<\/span><\/em>), and holy sites, among which are famous monasteries such as <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Lamo Dechen Ch\u00f6khorling<\/span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">lwa mo bde chen chos \u2018khor gling<\/span><\/em>), <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Deutsa Tashi Ch\u00f6ding<\/span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">lde\u2019u tsha bkra shis chos sding<\/span><\/em>), <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kou Bashedrup Dargyeling<\/span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">ko\u2019u ba bshad sgrub dar rgyas gling<\/span><\/em>), and <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Jakhyung Thekchen Y\u00f6nten Dargyeling<\/span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">bya khyung theg chen yon tan dar rgyas gling<\/span><\/em>).<\/p><p>Like any other place name, the name \"<span class=\"place\" title=\"F15480\">Chentsa<\/span>\" contains meaning. There are several different interpretations of the name deriving from the two Tibetan words in the name. \"<span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Chen<\/span>\" (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">gcan<\/span><\/em>) means \"beasts,\" and \"<span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">tsa<\/span>\" (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">tsha<\/span><\/em>) means \"hot\" or \"dangerous.\" Following this, the most popular interpretation of \"<span class=\"place\" title=\"F15480\">Chentsa<\/span>\" is a dangerous place infested with beasts that were unique to hot regions. The other interpretation is based on kinship. It is said that people of this area belonged to the <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Tsarik<\/span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">tsha rigs<\/span><\/em>), one of the 18 great <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dongtsa Chen<\/span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ldong tsha chen<\/span><\/em>) clans. Therefore, once it was called <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Tsay\u00fcl<\/span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">tsha yul<\/span><\/em>). There is also another less-known interpretation. <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Hortsang Jikm\u00e9<\/span> says that in the 9<sup>th<\/sup> century a minister of Emperor <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Tri Relwa<\/span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">khri ral ba<\/span><\/em>) came to <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15348\">Amdo<\/span> to collect taxes and became the ruler of the area while serving as <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">lachenpa<\/span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">la gcan pa<\/span><\/em>, \"tax collector\"). He also notes that <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Changkya Rolpai Dorj\u00e9<\/span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">lcang skya rol ba\u2019i rdo rje<\/span><\/em>), \u00a0a famous monk-scholar of the 18<sup>th<\/sup> century, spelled the name \"<span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Tsendza<\/span>\" (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">btsan rdz<\/span><\/em>a). Today the area is officially called Jianzha in Chinese.
