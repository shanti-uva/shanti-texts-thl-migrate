If summit facilities were located at this site they are no longer visible from below. There are over 20\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcaves in the west-facing vertical formation. Virtually all of the caves have lost substantial parts of their\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfronts due to slope failure and erosion. Arable land that was recently brought back under cultivation is found in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe valley below the site. It would appear that the caves represent an ancient troglodytic settlement that likely\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thad an agrarian economic base. The habitation function is borne out by the niches and bays hewn into certain\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcaves.

By following a series of extremely narrow ledges, it is possible to reach the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmidpoint of the cave complex. At this level, on the prow of the formation, there is a wall approximately 20 m in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlength and 1 m in height enclosing a natural shelf. It is made of natural earthen slabs cut from the formation and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thas two cobble vertical courses laid diagonally at its base. Caves and a walled ledge situated at higher elevation\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tare no longer approachable. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>According to local sources, <span class=\"popular\">Rak Khashak M&ouml;n Gi Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rag kha shag mon gyi mkhar</span> was an ancient castle of the <span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span>. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n"}]}
