It was\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcomprised of at least 14 rooms, the largest of which have internal dimensions of 3.5 m x 3.3 m and 2.8 m x 3.4 m\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(most westerly room). The relatively commodious rooms and the absence of wall buttressing indicate that this\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tedifice was primarily constructed with a wooden roof. All-stone structures, however, are also in evidence. Wall\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsections are commonly 1.5 m to 4 m in height. Consequently, the building still possesses a distinctive profile.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe mud-mortared random-rubble walls incorporate variable-sized granite stones (10 cm to 80 cm in length), some\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof which were hewn flat on their exterior sides. The lower or south level is in far worse condition than the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tupper tier of the structure. The entrance in the south punctuates a forward wall, 1.3 m thick. There are\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trecesses in the floor of the lower level, each around 1 m in length and 80 cm in width, which are partly covered\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tby small stone slabs. These members probably constituted part of the sub-flooring used to create a level base.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThere are a few beams made of a gray metamorphic stone strewn around the site. The stone lintel over the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tentrance between the lower and upper tiers of the building is still in situ. Against the outer walls of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tupper level there are several small stone chests. Perhaps these were used for ritual purposes. The remains of a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twalkway along the steep slope leading up to the stone chests are still visible. Just to the south of the main\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tedifice, on a separate peak, there is an isolated structure (3.5 m x 3.5 m) with walls 1 m to 1.3 m in height.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"sDe chos agriculture","index":9,"parent_index":6,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The approximately 5-km long <span class=\"popular\">Dech&ouml;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sde chos</span> valley\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcontains extensive arable holdings, less than 20% of which are still cultivated. This wholesale abandonment of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tprime agricultural land has one major environmental cause: the lack of water. So critical has the water\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsituation become for the people of the 35 households of <span class=\"popular\">Dech&ouml;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sde chos</span> village that they must travel far upstream to a little spring to meet their daily needs.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAccording to elderly residents, water for the irrigation of the barley crop was more plentiful in their youth.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis reduction in water appears to be a long-term phenomenon. The long-term observations of <span class=\"popular\">Rutok</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ru thog</span> natives indicate that the process of desiccation\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tis only intensifying in northwestern Tibet. The region is subject to multiple\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\train shadow effects created by the Himalaya, Karakorum, Transhimalaya, and Kunlun Ranges. It now receives less than 200 mm of precipitation per year. All throughout the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"popular\">Dech&ouml;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sde chos</span> valley there are the remains of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdisused agricultural parcels. The walls around these fields become ever more indistinct in a down valley\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdirection. This suggests that the abandonment of arable land first began in the lower reaches, furthest from the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsource of the <span class=\"popular\">Dech&ouml; Chu</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sde chos chu</span>. The lower valley\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\talso experiences considerably higher evaporation rates than the more sheltered upper valley, and this may have\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen an important factor in the dereliction of the fields. Around the lower valley plots there are the vestiges\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof stone walls and many have been encroached upon by sand deposits. On the other hand, some abandoned fields\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thigher up the valley still have integral retaining walls. The discarding of farmland appears to have been a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trelentless process until cultivation is now confined to the immediate environs of <span class=\"popular\">Dech&ouml;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sde chos</span> village. We can infer that, as the water in the <span class=\"popular\">Dech&ouml; Chu</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sde chos chu</span> diminished (it now only flows during wet\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsummer seasons), more and more fields were left fallow and eventually completely forsaken.

Around 20 years ago, an impoundment was built below the village\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto trap summer runoff.
