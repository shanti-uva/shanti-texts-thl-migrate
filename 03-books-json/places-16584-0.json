These two facilities were established on rocky shelves suspended in the mostly vertical slopes of the mountain known as <span class=\"popular\">Gang Ri Lhatsen Podrang<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Gangs ri lha btsan pho brang<\/span>. Located on the opposite side of the <span class=\"popular\">Lhachu<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Lha chu<\/span> from <span class=\"popular\">Tisé<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Ti se<\/span>, this rugged formation is popularly known as the dwelling place of <span class=\"popular\">Gang Ri Lhatsen<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Gangs ri lha btsan<\/span>, the fierce protector of the <span class=\"popular\">Gang Rinpoché<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Gangs rin po che<\/span> pilgrimage center.

These structures have random-rubble walls composed of cut stone blocks primarily 30 cm to 70 cm in length. A minimal amount of mud-mortar was used to cement the joints of some walls while other walls appear o be of the dry-stone variety. These walls generally exhibit much higher quality stonework than that found in the Buddhist monastic facilities of <span class=\"popular\">Chöku<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Chos sku<\/span>, situated directly below the site. The presence of these important residential monuments helps o establish the cultural prominence of <span class=\"popular\">Tisé<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Ti se<\/span> during he prehistoric epoch and\/or early historic period. Unlike the Buddhist monastery of <span class=\"popular\">Chöku<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Chos sku<\/span>, the placements of <span class=\"popular\">Rechen Puk<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Ras chen phug<\/span> and <span class=\"popular\">Nyenpo Ri Dzong<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Gnyan po ri rdzong<\/span> were chosen for their inherent strategic qualities.

Rather than a cave or small retreat house, this facility was actually a high social status building belonging to the archaic religious milieu of Upper Tibet. A few cairns (<span class=\"popular emph\">latsé<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">la btsas<\/span>) and prayer flags (<span class=\"popular emph\">lungta<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rlung rta<\/span>) are found at the site. According to the tradition preserved by the monks of <span class=\"popular\">Chöku<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Chos sku<\/span> monastery, <span class=\"popular\">Milarepa<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Mi la ras pa<\/span> (1040-1123 CE) and\/or his disciple <span class=\"popular\">Rechungpa Dorjé Drak<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Ras chung ba rdo rje grags<\/span> (1084-1161 CE) meditated at <span class=\"popular\">Rechen Puk<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Ras chen phug<\/span>, explaining why it is a Buddhist pilgrimage place, albeit of minor importance. Whether this tradition is apocryphal or not, it nicely illustrates the way in which archaic cultural assets were shorn of their original identity and function and invested with Buddhist meaning and legitimacy.<\/p> <p>The well-built edifice of <span class=\"popular\">Rechen Puk<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Ras chen phug<\/span> has walls up to 1 m thick, which are not aligned in the cardinal directions. The well-cut roof members strewn about the site reach 1.5 m in length. This building contained two main tiers of rooms: forward\/south and rear\/north. The forward or south wall of the edifice is upwards of 2 m in height in the vicinity of where it affronts the two rooms of the west portion of the forward tier. There is also a southwest wing (2.5 m x 2.3 m) in <span class=\"popular\">Rechen Puk<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Ras chen phug<\/span>, which consists of one or wo ruined rooms. There is still a lone corbel in position on the rear wall and one on the southwest wall of the southwest wing. East of the southwest wing of <span class=\"popular\">Rechen Puk<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Ras chen phug<\/span> there is the 1.8-m wide central forward room, much of which has collapsed upon itself. The east section of the forward tier (4.6 m x 2.4 m) of the edifice probably contained two rooms. Near the northeast corner of <span class=\"popular\">Rechen Puk<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Ras chen phug<\/span> some corbels remain in situ.<\/p> <p>The forward wall of the rear tier of<span class=\"popular\">Rechen Puk<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Ras chen phug<\/span> is 2 m in height, while its rear wall was built into the slope, thus giving the structure a semi-subterranean aspect. The main entrances to the surviving rear tier of rooms is from the east forward section. A south-facing entrance (1 m x 70 cm) opens to a fully intact room (1.6 m x 1.5 x 1.8 m), which now functions as a rudimentary Buddhist shrine. Adjacent to the south-facing entrance is an east-facing entrance (1 m x 60 cm) with a 1.2 m long lintel still intact. This entrance accesses a well-preserved separate suite of compartments. Entering inside <span class=\"popular\">Rechen Puk<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Ras chen phug<\/span> from this point, a narrow 4.5-m long passageway makes four right angle turns to reach a relatively large room (3.2 m x 2.5 m x 1.3 m), set deep inside the building. This room also functions as a Buddhist shrine. Rather than merely providing tortuous access to a single room, the elaborate plan of the passageway, with its four turns and two small alcoves, may have been accorded with residential or ritual functions. The short wall spans thus created also help to support the extremely heavy stone roof. <\/p> "},{"title":"gNyan po ri rdzong","index":8,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p>The probable <span class=\"popular emph\">sekhang<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">gsas khang<\/span> complex of <span class=\"popular\">Nyenpo Ri Dzong<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Gnyan po ri rdzong<\/span> is situated nearly 1 km east of <span class=\"popular\">Rechen Puk<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Ras chen phug<\/span>.
