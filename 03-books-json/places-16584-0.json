The forward or south wall of the edifice is upwards of 2 m in height in the vicinity of where it\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\taffronts the two rooms of the west portion of the forward tier.

East of the southwest wing of <span class=\"popular\">Rechen Puk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ras chen phug</span> there is the 1.8-m wide central forward room, much of which has collapsed upon itself. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\teast section of the forward tier (4.6 m x 2.4 m) of the edifice probably contained two rooms. Near the northeast\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcorner of <span class=\"popular\">Rechen Puk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ras chen phug</span> some corbels remain\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin situ.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The forward wall of the rear tier of<span class=\"popular\">Rechen Puk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ras chen phug</span> is 2 m in height, while its rear wall was built into the slope, thus giving the structure a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsemi-subterranean aspect. The main entrances to the surviving rear tier of rooms is from the east forward\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsection. A south-facing entrance (1 m x 70 cm) opens to a fully intact room (1.6 m x 1.5 x 1.8 m), which now\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfunctions as a rudimentary Buddhist shrine. Adjacent to the south-facing entrance is an\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\teast-facing entrance (1 m x 60 cm) with a 1.2 m long lintel still intact. This entrance accesses a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twell-preserved separate suite of compartments. Entering inside <span class=\"popular\">Rechen Puk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ras chen phug</span> from this point, a narrow 4.5-m long passageway makes four right\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tangle turns to reach a relatively large room (3.2 m x 2.5 m x 1.3 m), set deep inside the building. This room\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\talso functions as a Buddhist shrine. Rather than merely providing tortuous access to a single\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\troom, the elaborate plan of the passageway, with its four turns and two small alcoves, may have been accorded\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twith residential or ritual functions.
