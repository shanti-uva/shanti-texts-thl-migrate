The site enjoys good views in all directions but the west. The terrain is level and covered in sparse turf and small brush. The site consists of 11 in situ pillars erected inside an enclosure and what appears to be a large funerary superstructure. All the pillars of <span class=\"popular\">Marbuk Doring<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Dmar sbug rdo ring<\/span> are made of the same type of gray rock.

The enclosure appears to have been oriented in the intermediate points. The remaining wall fragment is of standard construction: a double-course (60 cm thick) structure composed of variable-length blocky stones (20 cm to 40 cm), which are either flush with the ground or which protrude slightly above the surface. The east corner of the enclosure is located 9 m from the row of pillars. The line of pillars stretches out over 3.2 m. The enclosure must have been somewhat wider than this. The ground that was situated inside the enclosure appears to have undergone significant geomorphologic changes and is now sloping. <\/p> "},{"title":"Pillars","index":8,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p>The four-sided specimens are very consistent, giving the impression that they may have been hewn into shape. The pillars form a U-shaped array. The eight pillars of the main row form a line near where the northwest wall of the enclosure must have existed. From southwest to northeast the pillars have the following dimensions and forms:<\/p> <ol> <li>Long-stone DR1: four-sided, broken (40 cm [height] x 80 cm [basal girth]).

The remaining U-shaped double-course wall fragment is 48 m long and perhaps 50 cm thick. The highly eroded, blocky stones in this wall are primarily 20 cm to 40 cm in length. The space enclosed by the wall gently slopes down to he east. A ravine now cuts through the base of the U-shaped structure, dislodging some of the stones. <\/p>  "}]}
