Driving for twenty-six\n                        kilometres eastward from the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">rdzong</span>, we come to mDo dar\n                        village in dBu yag <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">xiang</span>, from which a one hour&rsquo;s drive\n                        up the mountain brings us to sTong mda&rsquo; Monastery. This monastery is\n                        situated in the midst of several agricultural villages.</p>\n\n                     <p>The monastery was founded by gTsug phud tshul khrims, from whom the lineage\n                        of the heads of the monastery has led down to the ninth. Religious objects\n                        possessed by the monastery are as follows: a clay image of sTon pa gShen rab\n                        six cubits high; two white stupas, six cubits high; and more than ten masks\n                        of various kinds. Before 1959, the monastery had twenty-eight monks; this\n                        has now decreased to only seven. The practice of rituals is much the same as\n                        those of other Bonpo monasteries.</p>\n\n                     <p>Fifteen kilometres west of the monastery is a holy mountain called sGro ra\n                        Pad ma &rsquo;byung gnas. It looks just like a Garuda flying with its wings\n                        fluttering. Every year on the 15th day of the sixth month, the local people\n                        get together to circumambulate the mountain, perform religious dances and\n                        engage in other festivities.</p>\n\n                  "}]}
