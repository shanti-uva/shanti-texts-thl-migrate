Its walls are aligned to the slope gradient and not the cardinal directions. The forward wall of FS2 is 1 m in height and built in two tiers. The lower portion of the forward wall is set 60 cm outwards from the upper portion. The more substantial lower portion consists of a single course of large stones (50 cm to 80 cm long) and is around 40 cm in height. The rear wall is flush with the slope; the demarcation between them is now rather ambiguous. Goat and sheep horns have been placed on top of FS2. <\/p> "},{"title":"Funerary Structure FS3","index":9,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p>Funerary structure FS3 is situated 6.7 m southeast of FS2 at the same elevation. It appears to consist of a square base (5 m x 5.4 m), which is now heavily obscured by rubble. Upon this base sits an upper structure (2.9 m x 3 m) whose central portion is elevated an additional 70 cm. The rear wall of FS3 is flush with the slope. It appears that FS3 was a tiered structure; possibly it had non-funerary ceremonial identity. <\/p>  "}]}
