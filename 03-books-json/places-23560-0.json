Since the inhabitants of the area believed they heard a dragon\n                        roar in the sky when the monastery was being built, it was named La kha\n                        &rsquo;brug grags. The date of its foundation remains unknown. In the Earth-Dragon\n                        Year of the 16th Rab byung (1928), gYung drung bstan &rsquo;dzin, the\n                        twenty-fourth master in the Su la lineage, moved the monastery to its\n                        present site, which is known as dBra khyung, and renamed it bShad sgrub rab\n                        brtan gling. </p>\n\n                     <p>gYung drung bstan &rsquo;dzin, who studied for nine years in sMan ri in gTsang,\n                        founded another monastery called A sta khang tshan che ba.
