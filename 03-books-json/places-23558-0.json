No one knows when it was built or why it was abandoned. In the 13th\n                        Rab byung (1747-1806), another small monastery was built by gSang sngags\n                        gling pa. He also &ldquo;opened the door&rdquo;(gnas sgo phyed pa) of the hidden local\n                        mountain (i.e. transformed the place into sacred site) and called it sBas\n                        yul g-yung drung spungs tshal. He is believed to have discovered a number of\n                        holy objects on the sacred site including a statue of White Tara and a gold\n                        gshang bell. He donated these objects to Gong rgyal Monastery. Around that\n                        time the monastery had about one hundred monks. In the Wood-Bird Year of the\n                        15th Rab byung (1885), Bya btang bsTan pa&rsquo;i nyi ma undertook to build a new\n                        temple for the monastery following a plan made by gSang sngags gling pa.\n                        When it was completed two years later, gSang sngags gling pa was invited to\n                        consecrate it and to give the lung initiation of the Bonpo Kanjur. Later,\n                        other masters such as Shar rdza bKra shis rgyal mtshan, Khro sprul gYung\n                        drung mthong grol and the fifth Kun grol bDud &rsquo;dul gling pa also gave\n                        teachings at the monastery. </p>\n\n                     <p>The Gong rgyal dgon gyi lo rgyus (anonymous, MS) lists twenty-two successive\n                        masters of the Bya btang lineage until the middle of the 20th century: </p>\n\n                     <ol type=\"1\">\n                        <li>Nam mkha&rsquo; rgyal mtshan </li>\n\n                        <li>Nam mkha&rsquo; dbang ldan </li>\n\n                        <li>Ye shes rgyal mtshan </li>\n\n                        <li>gYung drung gsas pa </li>\n\n                        <li>bKra shis rgyal mtshan </li>\n\n                        <li>sDa dbon Nam mkha&rsquo; thog sdug </li>\n\n                        <li>sDa dbon Nam mkha&rsquo; rgyal mtshan </li>\n\n                        <li>Grags pa ye shes </li>\n\n                        <li>Tshe dbang bkra shis </li>\n\n                        <li>Shes rab bstan &rsquo;dzin </li>\n\n                        <li>bSod nams blo gros </li>\n\n                        <li>bSod nams &rsquo;od zer </li>\n\n                        <li>sDa dbon Rin chen blo ldan </li>\n\n                        <li>Zha bo zhabs ma Nyi ma grags pa </li>\n\n                        <li>sDa dbon sMon lam tshul khrims </li>\n\n                        <li>bsTan &rsquo;dzin dbang grags </li>\n\n                        <li>gYung drung rgyal mtshan </li>\n\n                        <li>Tshul khrims rgyal mtshan </li>\n\n                        <li>gYung drung bstan pa&rsquo;i nyi ma </li>\n\n                        <li>Dri med &rsquo;od zer </li>\n\n                        <li>Tshe dbang &rsquo;gyur med </li>\n\n                        <li>gShen bstan rgyal mtshan </li>\n                     </ol>\n\n                     <p>With Bya btang bsTan &rsquo;dzin dbang grags&rsquo;s two sons, the lineage divided into\n                        two branches. There are two versions of the history about when reincarnation\n                        was adopted for the succession of the Bya btang masters. According to one,\n                        the position continued to be hereditary (gdung brgyud) until Tshe dbang\n                        &rsquo;gyur med&rsquo;s time in the middle of the 20th century, after which it was\n                        transmitted by reincarnation. However, when I visited the monastery in 1997,\n                        I was told that the reincarnation system was adopted after Bya btang gYung\n                        drung rgyal mtshan&rsquo;s time. So far, because of the lack of reliable Sources\n                        it has been impossible to verify either versions of the story. Bya btang\n                        Tshe dbang &rsquo;gyur med also founded a tantric college specializing in the\n                        practice of the Phurpa cycle.</p>\n\n                     <p>In the nineteen-eighties, Blo li Trulku built a new assembly hall, as well\n                        as restoring the old assembly hall which was destroyed during the Cultural\n                        revolution. </p>\n\n                  \n\n                  \n\n                     "},{"title":"5.
