Although the enclosure is fragmentary, parts of all four double-course walls have survived. It measures 4.7 m (north-south) x 10.3 m (east-west). This robustly built structure is somewhat elevated above the surrounding plain. The enclosure does not appear to have been well aligned in the cardinal directions. The uncut blocks and slabs of the walls are primarily 20 cm to 40 cm in length. In the east wall (60 cm thick) of the enclosure, the largest stone is 60 cm long and protrudes 25 cm above the ground surface. Also, in the east wall there is a slab (45 cm long, 5 cm thick) that runs perpendicular (east-west) to the axis of the course. This \u2018portal\u2019 stone protrudes 8 cm from the ground and is situated 1.45 m from the northeast corner of the enclosure. A south wall segment is 80 cm thick and is elevated 30 cm above the surface. This elevated segment appears to consist of several vertical courses of blocks laid on op of one another. The north wall (60 cm thick) is the most intact in the enclosure; about 50 percent of it has survived intact. The upright stones in the north wall are elevated around 10 cm above ground level. A small section of the west wall has also endured.
