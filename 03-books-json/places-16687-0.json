Although the enclosure is fragmentary,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tparts of all four double-course walls have survived. It measures 4.7 m (north-south) x 10.3 m (east-west). This\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trobustly built structure is somewhat elevated above the surrounding plain. The enclosure does not appear to have\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen well aligned in the cardinal directions. The uncut blocks and slabs of the walls are primarily 20 cm to 40\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcm in length. In the east wall (60 cm thick) of the enclosure, the largest stone is 60 cm long and protrudes 25\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcm above the ground surface. Also, in the east wall there is a slab (45 cm long, 5 cm thick) that runs\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tperpendicular (east-west) to the axis of the course. This &lsquo;portal&rsquo; stone protrudes 8 cm from the ground and is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsituated 1.45 m from the northeast corner of the enclosure.

This elevated segment appears to consist of several vertical courses of blocks laid on\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttop of one another. The north wall (60 cm thick) is the most intact in the enclosure; about 50 percent of it has\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsurvived intact. The upright stones in the north wall are elevated around 10 cm above ground level. A small\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsection of the west wall has also endured.
