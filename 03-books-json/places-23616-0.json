His successor was gTso ’phags Nyi ma rgyal mtshan. After several generations the gTso tshang lineage was interrupted, but was reestablished with gYung drung bstan ’dzin who rebuilt the assembly hall (’du khang) in 1862. The monastery was then looked after by a series of religious practitioners: bSod nams bstan rgyal, Shes rab bstan ’dzin, A khu ’Brug yag, gYung drung phun tshogs and Kun dga’ rgyal mtshan. The monastery was closed down during the Cultural Revolution and was reopened in 1995, later than most monasteries which, for the most part, were rebuilt in the 1980s. Prior to its reopening, its monks lived in Rin spungs Monastery (No.200), since, according to oral tradition, Rin spungs was originally a branch of gTso tshang. </p><p>The reconstruction of gTso tshang was part of the Development Project of the One Hundred Townships of Sichuan Province launched in 1991 which included gTso tshang township. The monks of gTso tshang Monastery living in Rin spungs moved to the new gTso tshang Monastery after 1995, but, since it is new and small, Rin spungs Monastery still supports it and sends teachers whenever needed and the monastery has in fact become a branch of Rin spungs. The two monasteries perform their annual rituals together.</p>",
