His\n                        successor was gTso &rsquo;phags Nyi ma rgyal mtshan. After several generations the\n                        gTso tshang lineage was interrupted, but was reestablished with gYung drung\n                        bstan &rsquo;dzin who rebuilt the assembly hall (&rsquo;du khang) in 1862. The monastery\n                        was then looked after by a series of religious practitioners: bSod nams\n                        bstan rgyal, Shes rab bstan &rsquo;dzin, A khu &rsquo;Brug yag, gYung drung phun tshogs\n                        and Kun dga&rsquo; rgyal mtshan.

Prior to its reopening, its monks\n                        lived in Rin spungs Monastery (No.200), since, according to oral tradition,\n                        Rin spungs was originally a branch of gTso tshang. </p>\n\n                     <p>The reconstruction of gTso tshang was part of the Development Project of the\n                        One Hundred Townships of Sichuan Province launched in 1991 which included\n                        gTso tshang township.
