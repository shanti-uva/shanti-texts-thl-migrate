This embraces the transcription of words for which there is no clear traditional literary spelling, as well as new spellings for well attested literary words that try to account for the significant divergence between the classical spelling and their contemporary pronunciation. Keep in mind that these spellings are dialect-specific since the derive from pronunciation, and pronunciation varies across dialects of Tibetan.</p>",
