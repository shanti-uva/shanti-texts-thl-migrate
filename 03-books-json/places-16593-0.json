The south and north bluffs are separated by an approximately 100-m wide ravine.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe site consists of three residential loci: north bluff complex, south bluff complex and foot of the south bluff\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcomplex. The adeptly built structures of <span class=\"popular\">zimpuk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gzims phug</span> have an eastern aspect. The random-rubble, mud-mortared walls contain variable-sized blocks and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tslabs, some of which reach 50 cm to 80 cm in length. Most of the stones have a reddish color and many of them were\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdressed. All buildings at the site exhibit similar aging processes such as obdurate mortar supporting lichen\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth. Most of the mortar, however, has washed out of the joints. This uniformity in the physical condition of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe structures seems to indicate that <span class=\"popular\">zimpuk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gzims phug</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twas established as an integral installation. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The presence of significant Buddhist shrines at <span class=\"popular\">zimpuk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gzims phug</span>, the placement of the site near the bottom of a river valley as well as\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcertain morphological features (relatively high elevation structures, tall entranceways, a commodious rear room, a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trear window and other windows, and buildings with an above-ground aspect) seem to indicate an early historic\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tperiod foundation by Buddhists. The construction of <span class=\"popular\">zimpuk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gzims phug</span> relied on the materials and building techniques incumbent in the construction\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the <span class=\"popular emph\">do khang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rdo khang</span>, an architectural form derived from the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tarchaic cultural legacy. The all-stone corbelled facility appears to have been built as part and parcel of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUpper Tibet&rsquo;s first florescence of Buddhist monuments. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\testablishment of <span class=\"popular\">zimpuk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gzims phug</span> therefore seems to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcoincide with a late phase in the practice of the old architectural traditions of the region.

Approximately 7 m\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbeyond the gateway, a wall running north-south separates the main complex from the access route. At its\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnorthern extremity, this wall turns east to join a lone building (3.3 m x 3.8 m). This building contains a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsingle room with a few corbels still attached to the walls, indicating that it was built with a stone roof.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe north wall extends 50 cm above these corbels, indicating the presence of either a parapet wall or a roof\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twith successive layers of bridging stones. The intact entranceway (1.2 m x 60 cm) to this small building faces\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twest towards the main building. The east-west wall continues past this dependency, sequestering it from the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmain building. This now discontinuous wall has a maximum height of 2.5 m on its forward or east side and a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmaximum height of 1.5 m on its inner side.

Exterior walls are up to 1 m in thick, illustrating the strength of this structure. The rear or\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twest wall stands fully out of the ground and is still around 3 m in height. The north section of the rear wall\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tis capped with a 50-cm-thick layer of stones mixed with mud. In the west wall there is a single window with a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlarge lintel (25 cm x 50 cm). </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The north portion of the main building is divided into three tiers of rooms oriented east-west. The forward\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tor east tier has been largely destroyed. The forward wall is up to 2 m in height, although most of it is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconsiderably lower. This wall does not appear to have been very straight (as is often the case with <span class=\"popular emph\">do khang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rdo khang</span>). There are a few in situ corbels on the walls\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the forward tier. The east-facing entranceway (1.4 m x 60 cm) to the middle tier is still intact. This\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tentranceway accesses a small room (1.6 m x 2.3 m) with a portion of its roof still in place. Immediately north\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the middle tier entranceway there is an entrance (1.3 m x 50 cm) to another small room (1.5 m x 1.7 m). The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\troof in this room is partially intact and is set about 1.6 m above the floor. In the east wall there is a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twindow (20 cm x 25 cm) that opens onto the forward tier. Some red ochre tinted mud plaster is still attached\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto the interior walls of this small room. This room must have been a chapel or sanctum of some kind.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Access to the rear tier of the main building is via the middle tier room with the east-facing exterior\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tentranceway. The rear entranceway is whole (1.4 m x 50 cm) and leads into a relatively large room (4.5 m x 2.3\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tm) whose end coincides with the exterior west wall of the main edifice. The east side of this room is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbuttressed, creating various nooks some of which have in situ corbels resting above them. This large rear\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsouth room was entirely built above-ground. The rear/west wall of this large room extends about 1 m above the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin situ corbels to produce a parapet-like structure. The floor-to-ceiling height of the rear south room was\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tapproximately 1.6 m. This size and relative placement of this room suggests that it had a common ceremonial\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfunction. There is also an adjacent small rear south room with a window in the rear wall (as already noted\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tabove). This is the only <span class=\"popular emph\">do khang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rdo khang</span> surveyed to date\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twith an upslope-facing window. There are a few in situ corbels in the small south rear room. The exterior\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlines of the building suggest that there was yet another rear south room but nearly all vestiges of it have\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen effaced. On the southeast side of the rear west room there is an entranceway (1.3 m x 50 cm) that\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\taccesses another middle tier room. The stone roof over this room (2 m x 2.4 m) has largely survived, and was\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconstructed of bridging stones laid diagonally. The ceiling is 2 m high in this room. In the south wall there\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tis a window (50 cm x 25 cm).
