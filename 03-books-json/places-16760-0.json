Other slabs lie broken on the ground beside the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstructure. Each of the in situ slabs is elevated more than 20 cm above ground level. The largest among them (45\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcm long) is raised 70 cm above the surface.

All the slabs are inclined at various angles through\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe effect of gravity. These naturally occurring, dark gray rocks are just 3 cm to 5 cm thick. All in all, this\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsuperstructure exhibits the most highly elevated slab walls of any superstructure surveyed to date.
