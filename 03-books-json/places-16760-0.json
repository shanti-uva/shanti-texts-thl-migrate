At the time of installation, it is likely that the terrain was more stable than it is in the contemporary period, with its shifting sands. These pillars form a curved row, 10 m in length. The irregularly shaped stones are raised 20 cm to 75 cm above the current ground level, broken specimens notwithstanding. Mostly dark-colored, naturally occurring rocks were selected for erection. It is possible that there is more to this monument than meets the eye: parts of it may lie buried under the deep sand.</p>

This wall, made of a single line of small upright stones, appears to be an ancient feature. On one end of this wall there are the remains of another highly degraded, small superstructure.</p>

It was built on flat sandy ground. Measuring 3 m x 2.5 m, the single-course perimeter of this enclosure is made up of thin upright slabs, 11 of which are still in situ. Other slabs lie broken on the ground beside the structure. Each of the in situ slabs is elevated more than 20 cm above ground level. The largest among them (45 cm long) is raised 70 cm above the surface. These slab walls may have been aligned in the cardinal directions, but they have shifted too much for a definite assessment. All the slabs are inclined at various angles through he effect of gravity. These naturally occurring, dark gray rocks are just 3 cm to 5 cm thick. All in all, this superstructure exhibits the most highly elevated slab walls of any superstructure surveyed to date. Due to its design, it superficially resembles tombs of the Slab Grave culture of north Inner Asia.<a href=\"#n56\" name=\"nb56\" class=\"note\">56</a> </p>
