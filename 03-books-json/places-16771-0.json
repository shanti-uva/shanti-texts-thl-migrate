The site is named for <span class=\"popular\">Gyamnak</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gyam nag</span>, a small dark-colored escarpment in the vicinity, at which there is a summer pastoral encampment\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(<span class=\"popular emph\">yarsa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">dbyar sa</span>). The terrain gently slopes down towards the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnortheast and is strewn with rocks, gravel and brush. The view east towards <span class=\"popular\">Beltsa Gyangtrok</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bal tshwa gyang khrog</span> (C-82 and D-58) is especially wide open.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"popular\">Gyamnak M&ouml;nkhang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gyam nag mon khang</span> consists of 19\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmajor funerary structures. These structures, most or all of which were used for burial purposes, are not aligned\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin the cardinal directions nor could any pattern in their overall distribution be discerned. The tombs are spread\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tout over an area of several hectares. Most of the superstructures are either quadrate constructions elevated\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsignificantly above the ground surface or non-descript enclosures level with the ground surface. It appears that\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthese superstructures of variable size were of the superficial enclosure or <span class=\"popular emph\">bangso</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">bang so</span> type, however, most structural evidence on the surface has been severely disturbed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe superstructures contained variable length (20 cm to 80 cm) unhewn light-colored stones, which were embedded in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe ground along the perimeter. The subsurface architecture (at least where visible) consists of well-built\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmasonry-lined walls, generally built with large slabs (up to 1 m or more in length). Massive capstones (up to at\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tleast 2.1 m long) were placed upon these walls. The floors of the cists are not visible; rather they are obscured\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tby soil and debris. It could not therefore be determined what type of base the burial chambers possessed. Due to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe obscuring of the cists by rubble, capstones and the soil overlay, their precise dimensions could not be\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdetermined. It appears that many of these cists were relatively long and narrow with wider chambers at each end.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn addition to the 19 major structures of <span class=\"popular\">Gyamnak M&ouml;nkhang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gyam nag mon khang</span>, there are several smaller highly fragmentary constructions scattered about. These include\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe only extant slab-wall fragment left on the surface at the site. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>According to local sources, several years ago a road construction crew of perhaps eight men came to <span class=\"popular\">Gyamnak M&ouml;nkhang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gyam nag mon khang</span> in order to extract stones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThey smashed the superstructures to reach large stones capping the burial chambers. They removed no less than 30\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstones, up to 2 m in length, from the so-called <span class=\"popular emph\">m&ouml;n khang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mon\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tkhang</span>. A number of tombs were very seriously damaged in this operation and are now exposed to the full fury\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the elements. The stones were transported several kilometers away to the <span class=\"popular\">Gangchen</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gangs chen</span>flood plain and used to build culverts along the main road to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsouthwestern Tibet. More stones were pilfered than were needed for this work and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnow lie unused on the roadside. The opened tombs have been cleared of any contents they might have once held.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInquires as to what was recovered by the road gang did not turn up any hard information. No artifacts, bones or\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tother materials were detected at the site, but only a cursory search was conducted. In addition to the recent case\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof vandalism, there are tombs with highly eroded subsurface members on the surface, which may well be evidence of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tan earlier pilferage of the site.
