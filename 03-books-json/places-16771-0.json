The site is named for <span class=\"popular\">Gyamnak<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Gyam nag<\/span>, a small dark-colored escarpment in the vicinity, at which there is a summer pastoral encampment (<span class=\"popular emph\">yarsa<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">dbyar sa<\/span>). The terrain gently slopes down towards the northeast and is strewn with rocks, gravel and brush. The view east towards <span class=\"popular\">Beltsa Gyangtrok<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Bal tshwa gyang khrog<\/span> (C-82 and D-58) is especially wide open. <span class=\"popular\">Gyamnak M\u00f6nkhang<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Gyam nag mon khang<\/span> consists of 19 major funerary structures. These structures, most or all of which were used for burial purposes, are not aligned in the cardinal directions nor could any pattern in their overall distribution be discerned. The tombs are spread out over an area of several hectares. Most of the superstructures are either quadrate constructions elevated significantly above the ground surface or non-descript enclosures level with the ground surface. It appears that hese superstructures of variable size were of the superficial enclosure or <span class=\"popular emph\">bangso<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">bang so<\/span> type, however, most structural evidence on the surface has been severely disturbed. The superstructures contained variable length (20 cm to 80 cm) unhewn light-colored stones, which were embedded in he ground along the perimeter. The subsurface architecture (at least where visible) consists of well-built masonry-lined walls, generally built with large slabs (up to 1 m or more in length). Massive capstones (up to at least 2.1 m long) were placed upon these walls. The floors of the cists are not visible; rather they are obscured by soil and debris. It could not therefore be determined what type of base the burial chambers possessed. Due to he obscuring of the cists by rubble, capstones and the soil overlay, their precise dimensions could not be determined. It appears that many of these cists were relatively long and narrow with wider chambers at each end. In addition to the 19 major structures of <span class=\"popular\">Gyamnak M\u00f6nkhang<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Gyam nag mon khang<\/span>, there are several smaller highly fragmentary constructions scattered about. These include he only extant slab-wall fragment left on the surface at the site. <\/p><p>According to local sources, several years ago a road construction crew of perhaps eight men came to <span class=\"popular\">Gyamnak M\u00f6nkhang<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Gyam nag mon khang<\/span> in order to extract stones. They smashed the superstructures to reach large stones capping the burial chambers. They removed no less than 30 stones, up to 2 m in length, from the so-called <span class=\"popular emph\">m\u00f6n khang<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mon khang<\/span>. A number of tombs were very seriously damaged in this operation and are now exposed to the full fury of the elements. The stones were transported several kilometers away to the <span class=\"popular\">Gangchen<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Gangs chen<\/span>flood plain and used to build culverts along the main road to southwestern Tibet. More stones were pilfered than were needed for this work and now lie unused on the roadside. The opened tombs have been cleared of any contents they might have once held. Inquires as to what was recovered by the road gang did not turn up any hard information. No artifacts, bones or other materials were detected at the site, but only a cursory search was conducted. In addition to the recent case of vandalism, there are tombs with highly eroded subsurface members on the surface, which may well be evidence of an earlier pilferage of the site. The destruction of <span class=\"popular\">Gyamnak M\u00f6nkhang<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Gyam nag mon khang<\/span> underlines the urgency of an effective conservation program being instituted in Upper Tibet. <\/p>"},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":"<p>According to local sources, <span class=\"popular\">Gyamnak M\u00f6nkhang<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Gyam nag mon khang<\/span> is the vestiges of an ancient <span class=\"popular\">M\u00f6n<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon<\/span> habitation.<\/p>"},{"title":"Site elements","index":6,"parent_index":2},{"title":"Funerary sructure FS1","index":7,"parent_index":6,"body":"<p>Funerary sructure FS1 (5.6 m x 3.2 m) consists of an incoherent perimeter level with the ground surface (29\u00b0 36.578\u0384 N. lat. \/ 84\u00b0 38.350\u0384 E. long.).

This large structure is elevated 1m above the surrounding terrain on its north side and as much as 2 m on its south side. The superstructure consists of two mounds, the north one of which was partially opened by road workers in order to remove capstones. There are still two in situ capstones (2 m x 60 cm, 2.1 m x 50 cm) suspended over the opened grave chamber. This rectangular cist currently has a maximum depth of 1.4 m. The subsurface walls of the cist were either partially or completely lined in random-work masonry (containing stone slabs that regularly attain 1 m in length). These walls act as the structural support for the capstones. The southeast extremity of the north burial chamber has four more large in situ capstones. These capstones are tightly pressed against one another. One of them is partially exposed while the other three are still covered by soil and small cobbles. The configuration of the four capstones indicates that the entire burial chamber was sealed by a tight-knit series of large stones. The south mound of the FS3 superstructure does not appear to have been recently disturbed. <\/p>"},{"title":"Funerary sructure FS4","index":10,"parent_index":6,"body":"<p>Funerary sructure FS4 (3.8 m x 2.8 m) is situated 2.8 m east of FS3 (36.542\u0384 \/ 38.369\u0384).
