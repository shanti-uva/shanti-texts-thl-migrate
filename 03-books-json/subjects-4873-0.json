This is often labeled a \u201ccolophon,\u201d but we have chosen to separate it out as a \u201cclosing section\u201d since it is distinct from the following sections and at times contains considerably more information than merely the title. For Tengyur texts this often includes a statement indicating who wrote the text.

This is not an author's colophon unless it says something like \"I, so-and-so, wrote this at such-and-such place, at such-and-such time, at the request of so-and-so\" etc. The presence of any such parts of the statement identify the section as an author's colophon. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thlib.org\/tools\/#wiki=\/access\/wiki\/site\/c06fa8cf-c49c-4ebc-007f-482de5382105\/more%20issues%20related%20to%20closing%20sections.html\">More Issues Related to Closing Sections<\/a>.<\/p>","title":"An Overview of the Closing Section"}]}
