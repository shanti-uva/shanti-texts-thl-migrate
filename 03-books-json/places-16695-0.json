This enclosure is designed in the extreme western Tibet regional \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfashion with longer north-south dimensions. The enclosure is somewhat elevated above the surrounding plain. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tParts of all four double-course walls (50 cm to 70 cm thick) have survived. These walls are primarily built of \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tigneous cobbles 20 cm to 30 cm in length. These stones are even with the ground surface or project above it to a \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmaximum height of 10 cm. There is a possible funerary superstructure (8 m across) located 14 m southeast of the \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tenclosure.

The broken top of this highly \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tweathered four-sided pillar still lies on the site. It is 65 cm long and has a girth of 85 cm. It is reported \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the other pillar stood near the northwest corner of the enclosure. This specimen had a total length of \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\taround 1.5 m.
