The name is only known by its pronunciation and thus its exact meaning remains obscure. Shing skam in Tibetan, if spelt the way it is pronounced, literally means \u201cdead tree\u201d; this interpretation corresponds to one legend according to which the monastery was built on a site where many trees died. The monastery is also known as Kha ba lung, since it is situated in Kha ba lung.<\/p><p>The local Bonpo community simply calls it Kha ba lung, but it should not be confused with the Buddhist monastery of the same name in the vicinity. To distinguish them, the Buddhist monastery, which is located above the village, is referred to as Kha ba lung dgon pa gong ma (upper Kha ba lung Monastery) and the Bonpo monastery, which is located at the bottom of the village, as Kha ba lung dgon pa \u2019gab ma (lower Kha ba lung Monastery) (<span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">\u2019gab ma<\/span> has the same meaning as <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">zhol ma<\/span> in Amdo dialect).
