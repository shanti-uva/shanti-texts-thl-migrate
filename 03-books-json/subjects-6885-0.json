   "body": "<p>\"Other official building\" is used as a particular building type within the <em>Lhasa Atlas</em> by Knud Larsen and Amund Sinding-Larsen. In the \"Historical buildings in Lhasa\" table at the back of the book (pp. 165-172), buildings of the \"Other official building\" type are designated with the letter \"E\" in the building type column. In the THL Place Dictionary, when a building has this feature type and the <em>Lhasa Atlas</em> is given as the source, it means that the building was designated with a \"E\" in the <em>Lhasa Atlas</em> table.<br><br>This building type is described as follows:<br><br>\"<em>E. Other official buildings</em>.<br><br>\"These are mostly found in Shöl: Shöl Barkhang (printing house) (305), Ngü Barkhang (money printing house) (298), Shöl Lekhung (administrative building) (289) and Shöl Dekyiling (prison) (290). The only building of this type in the old town is Nangtseshar (prison) (8)\" (p. 60-61).<br><br>Source:<br><br>Larsen, Knud and Amund Sinding-Larsen. <em>The Lhasa Atlas: Traditional Tibetan Architecture and Townscape</em>.
