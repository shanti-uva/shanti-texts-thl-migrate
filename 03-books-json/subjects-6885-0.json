In the \"Historical buildings in Lhasa\" table at the back of the book (pp. 165-172), buildings of the \"Other official building\" type are designated with the letter \"E\" in the building type column. In the THL Place Dictionary, when a building has this feature type and the <em>Lhasa Atlas</em> is given as the source, it means that the building was designated with a \"E\" in the <em>Lhasa Atlas</em> table.<br /><br />This building type is described as follows:<br /><br />\"<em>E. Other official buildings</em>.<br /><br />\"These are mostly found in Sh&ouml;l: Sh&ouml;l Barkhang (printing house) (305), Ng&uuml; Barkhang (money printing house) (298), Sh&ouml;l Lekhung (administrative building) (289) and Sh&ouml;l Dekyiling (prison) (290). The only building of this type in the old town is Nangtseshar (prison) (8)\" (p. 60-61).<br /><br />Source:<br /><br />Larsen, Knud and Amund Sinding-Larsen. <em>The Lhasa Atlas: Traditional Tibetan Architecture and Townscape</em>.
