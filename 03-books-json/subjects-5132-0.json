The following sentences, for example, do not specify a subject:</p> <ul> <li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ཁྱོན་ནས་མཆོད་ཀྱི་མ་རེད།</span> “(She) never drinks.”</li> <li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">དབྱིན་ཇི་ནས་རེད་པས།</span> “Is (he) from England?”</li> </ul> <p>It is often the case that the auxiliary or the interrogative particle indicates whether the subject is the first, second, or third person, but in many instances the context is our only clue. Thus in another context the last sentence might mean “Am I from England?”</p>","title":""}]}
