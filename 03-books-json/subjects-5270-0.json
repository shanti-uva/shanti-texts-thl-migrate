It goes directly after the last letter of a word, in the place of the intersyllabic dot. There are two exceptions to this rule. First, the simple bar is not used after the letter <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">\u0f42\u0f0b<\/span>, when the latter carries no subscript or superscript; in this case one simply writes <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">\u0f42<\/span>. Secondly, after the letter <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">\u0f44\u0f0b<\/span>, an intersyllabic dot is placed before the <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">\u0f62\u0f90\u0fb1\u0f44\u0f0b\u0f64\u0f51\u0f0b<\/span>, resulting in <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">\u0f44\u0f0b\u0f0d<\/span>. This is to avoid confusion with a <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">\u0f56<\/span> followed by a <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">\u0f62\u0f90\u0fb1\u0f44\u0f0b\u0f64\u0f51\u0f0b<\/span>: <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">\u0f56\u0f0d<\/span>.<\/p><p class=\"Paragraph\">This punctuation bar may be used to mark the end of a clause, to make it easier to break up a sentence, and to emphasize the rhythm of the statements by marking pauses. It may also occur after individual words, especially in the case of lists. It may also go after case markers (\u00d8, <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">\u0f42\u0f72\u0f66\u0f0b<\/span>, <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">\u0f53\u0f66\u0f0b<\/span>, <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">\u0f63\u0f0b<\/span>, <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">\u0f51\u0f74\u0f0b<\/span>, <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">\u0f63\u0f66\u0f0b<\/span>, etc.), conjunctions (<span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">\u0f5e\u0f72\u0f44\u0f0b<\/span>, <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">\u0f51\u0f44\u0f0b<\/span>, <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">\u0f53\u0f66\u0f0b<\/span>, <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">\u0f66\u0f9f\u0f7a\u0f0b<\/span>, <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">\u0f63\u0f0b<\/span>, etc.), and verbs, as well as after the final particle <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">\u0f60\u0f7c\u0f0b<\/span>. The <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">\u0f62\u0f90\u0fb1\u0f44\u0f0b\u0f64\u0f51\u0f0b<\/span> may be represented in European languages by a comma, a semicolon, a colon, a question mark, or a period. Note that the simple bar is used at the end of each line in poetic verse.<\/p><p class=\"Paragraph\">In Literary Tibetan, many of the tasks that European languages assign to punctuation are fulfilled by grammatical particles. Thus <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">\u0f60\u0f7c\u0f0b<\/span> (and its variants) signify a period or the end of reported speech, <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">\u0f56\u0f45\u0f66\u0f0b<\/span> concludes a list and <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">\u0f45\u0f7a\u0f66\u0f0b<\/span> closes reported speech. One meaning of the particle <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">\u0f66\u0f9f\u0f7a\u0f0b<\/span> is comparable to the function of the semicolon. And finally, depending on the context, the particle <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">\u0f60\u0f58\u0f0b<\/span> may correspond to a question mark, a colon or a comma.<\/p><p class=\"Paragraph\">Apart from the <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">\u0f62\u0f90\u0fb1\u0f44\u0f0b\u0f64\u0f51\u0f0b<\/span>, Tibetan literature also uses the following symbols:<\/p><ul> <li>The sign<span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\"> \u0f04\u0f05<\/span>, which is called <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">\u0f61\u0f72\u0f42\u0f0b\u0f58\u0f42\u0f7c\u0f0b<\/span> or <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">\u0f51\u0f56\u0f74\u0f0b\u0f60\u0f41\u0fb1\u0f74\u0f51\u0f0b<\/span>, marks the beginning of a text or of a page.

This sign is used instead of the simple bar in <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">\u0f42\u0f4f\u0f7a\u0f62\u0f0b\u0f58\u0f0b<\/span> or \u201ctreasure-texts\u201d which are traditionally held to have been concealed by Padmasambhava and subsequently brought to light by \u201ctreasure-revealers\u201d <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">\u0f42\u0f4f\u0f7a\u0f62\u0f0b\u0f66\u0f9f\u0f7c\u0f53\u0f0b<\/span>.<\/li> <li>A sequence of intersyllabic dots signifies that the scribe has made a mistake (the dots fill the space occupied by the erased letters), or that there was no room to write the syllables before the end of a line.<\/li> <\/ul><p class=\"Paragraph\">A few other punctuation marks may be added to this list:<\/p><ul> <li>The sign<span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\"> \u0fbe<\/span>, which is called a <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">\u0f40\u0f74\u0f0b\u0f62\u0f74\u0f0b\u0f41\u0f0b<\/span> or \u201ccross,\u201d stands for omitted material that is frequently repeated within the text (in the case of prayers, for example). <\/li> <li>A little circle written beneath a syllable is intended to attract the reader\u2019s attention to the word in question.
