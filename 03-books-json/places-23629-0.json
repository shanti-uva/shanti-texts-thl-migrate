The temple was built more than 900 years ago by Yang ston rGyal mtshan rin chen. The latter had been staying near Mt. Kailash, where he had a dream in which he received a visit from Dran pa nam mkha’. He was told to go to Dolpo and to build a temple there. Shortly after this dream he left Tibet for Dolpo, travelling through Saldang, Namdo and Bi cher. At that time the village of Bi cher already existed and contained a prayer-hall, a prayer-wheel and several statues. Yang ston rGyal mtshan rin chen searched in many places until he found bSam gling, and the various auspicious dreams he had while staying there persuaded him that this was the place in which he should build a monastery.</p>
