Although the\n                        distance is not great, travelling it is very hard because of the absence of\n                        a road.</p>\n\n                     <p>The date of this monastery&rsquo;s establishment is unknown, but according to oral\n                        history it is one of the oldest Bonpo monasteries. Before 1959, the\n                        monastery had forty-seven monks. At present, it is a moderate-sized Bonpo\n                        monastery of thirty-one monks, with an assembly hall, a temple, monks&rsquo;\n                        quarters and other buildings. It has religious objects appropriate to its\n                        size and needs, such as statues of sTon pa Khri gtsug rgyal ba, Dran pa nam\n                        mkha&rsquo;, his son Tshe dbang rig &rsquo;dzin, sTag la me &rsquo;bar and Srid pa rgyal mo,\n                        thangka, <em xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\">the bKa&rsquo; &rsquo;gyur</em>, and other books\n                        concerning religious practice. Rituals and services are practised in this\n                        monastery as they are in other Bonpo monasteries of average size. It has no\n                        special activities.</p>\n\n                     <p>As for the monks&rsquo; main source of income, they receive financial support from\n                        their own parents and relatives. The monastery itself has no other means of\n                        earning revenue. Occasionally the monks are invited to perform religious\n                        services, such as funerals, in villages, which helps supplement their\n                        income.</p>\n\n                  "}]}
