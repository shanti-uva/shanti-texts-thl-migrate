The radical recasting of the site since that time now makes the task of assessment virtually\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\timpossible. As of 2002, the east side of the summit was under the complete domination of the monastery. Other\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsections of the hilltop, however, appeared to host the obscured remains of a defense facility. There were\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstructural traces of a 1-m-thick circumvallating parapet wall on various parts of the rim of the summit. There\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twere also vestiges of what were probably ramparts on the abrupt west and north flanks of the formation. On the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsoutheast side of the hill, sections of revetments up to 2 m in height were extant. Some vestiges of these\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdefensive works are still in situ. A considerable amount of stone rubble was found on the summit and spilling\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdown the east, west and south sides of the hill. Now the rubble has been cleared and the entire hilltop has been\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgiven over to Buddhist activities. Several monastic residences were built from the structural\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdetritus of the old fortress on the flat west summit. Some of these houses were destroyed before living memory\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand others reportedly built just 60 years ago. All buildings on the west summit were recently razed and are now\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tundergoing reconstruction. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<hr class=\"footnote-divider\" />\n"},{"title":"Notes","index":9,"parent_index":0,"body":"\n<div class=\"footnote\">\n<a name=\"n41\" />\n<a href=\"#nb41\" class=\"note\">\n\t     \t\t\t\t[41] </a> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHistorical information on the <span class=\"popular\">J iu</span><span class=\"scholar\">Byi&rsquo;u</span>locale\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tis also recorded in <span class=\"popular\">Guge Tsering Gyelpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ge tshe ring rgyal po</span>, <span class=\"popular emph\">Ngari Ch&ouml;mjung Gangjong Dzegyen</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">Mnga&rsquo; ris chos &rsquo;byung gangs ljongs mdzes rgyan</span> (Lha sa: <span class=\"popular\">B&ouml; Jong Mimang Petr&uuml;n Khang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bod ljongs mi dmangs dpe skrun khang</span>. 2006), 152.
