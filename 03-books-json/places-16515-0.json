Located on the northeast shore of <span class=\"popular\">Mapam Yutso</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ma pham g.yu mtsho</span>, the summit of <span class=\"popular\">J iu</span><span class=\"scholar\">Byi’u</span> is 80 m long and a maximum of 24 m wide (west side). The circumambulatory path around the holy lake and the important route between ma phang g.yu mtsho and <span class=\"popular\">Langa Tso</span><span class=\"scholar\">La lnga mtsho</span> (links the Himalayan conduit of <span class=\"popular\">Purang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Spu rang</span> and the uplands around the pilgrimage center of Mount <span class=\"popular\">Tisé</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ti se</span>) could have been effectively controlled from this position. It does not seem likely that such a strategically and economically vital location would have been ignored during the archaic cultural horizon. Immediately east of <span class=\"popular\">Chiu Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Byi’u mkhar</span> is the famous monastery of <span class=\"popular\">J iu</span><span class=\"scholar\">Byi’u</span> with its <span class=\"popular\">Guru Rinpoché</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ru rin po che</span> cave. As such, the <span class=\"popular\">Guru Rinpoché</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ru rin po che</span> myth may have been contrived to supplant or suppress awareness of an earlier occupation. The probable archaic cultural origin of the fortress is supported by:</p> <ol type=\"1\"> <li>The absence of a Buddhist narrative associated with the stronghold.</li> <li>Its highly strategic position on important lines of communication.</li> <li>Its prime geomantic placement on the waterway linking two sacred lakes.</li> <li>The presence of cave shelters, hot springs and ample fresh water resources nearby.</li> <li>The existence of archaic cemeteries and isolated pillars in the vicinity.</li> </ol> "},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":" <p>According to the local oral tradition, the name <span class=\"popular\">Chiu Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Byi’u mkhar</span> comes from a small bird that flew into the cave of <span class=\"popular\">Guru Rinpoché</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ru rin po che</span>. It is also said that from this location <span class=\"popular\">Guru Rinpoché</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ru rin po che</span> went to the southwest country of the <span class=\"popular\">sinpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Srin po</span> (man-eating ogres) in the form of a little bird (<span class=\"popular emph\">J iu</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">byi’u</span>). However, the current head of the <span class=\"popular emph\">nyingmapa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rnying ma pa</span> <span class=\"popular\">J iu</span><span class=\"scholar\">Byi’u</span> monastery, <span class=\"popular\">Padma Chömpel</span><span class=\"scholar\">Padma chos ’phel</span> (born circa 1939), has not been able to confirm either of these stories. The local <span class=\"popular\">Guru Rinpoché</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ru rin po che</span> myth also states that the <span class=\"emph\">VajrayAna</span> master meditated in his cave for seven days, and during that time a miraculously speaking sandalwood image of himself appeared from <span class=\"popular\">Mapam Yutso</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ma pham g.yu mtsho</span>. This highly valued statue was enshrined at <span class=\"popular\">J iu</span><span class=\"scholar\">Byi’u</span> monastery until it was stolen in the Chinese Cultural Revolution. Originally, the Buddhist holy site was known as <span class=\"popular\">Padma Gyepé Lhakang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Padma rgyas pa’i lha khang</span> (Temple of the Spreading Lotus) and successively as <span class=\"popular\">Jiu Padmé Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Byi’u padma’i mkhar</span> (Castle of the Little Bird Lotus), <span class=\"popular\">Jiu Zamzo Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Byi’u zam bzo mkhar</span> (Little Bird Fashioned Bridge Castle), and finally under the <span class=\"popular emph\">Drugpa Kagyü</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">’brug pa bka’ brgyud</span> subsect, as <span class=\"popular\">Jiu Gönpa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Byi’u dgon pa</span>. In the Chinese Cultural Revolution, texts recording the history and lore of the monastery were lost. Recently, at the behest of prefectural authorities, the head lama of <span class=\"popular\">J iu</span><span class=\"scholar\">Byi’u</span> monastery, <span class=\"popular\">Padma Chömpel</span><span class=\"scholar\">Padma chos ’phel</span>, authored a four folio text that contains much of the same information recorded above. Locally, it is said that the formidable fortress on the summit once had a wall encircling it. In this period, the <span class=\"popular\">Ganga Chu</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ganga chu</span> at the base of the formation was supposedly much deeper and spanned by a bridge that was guarded from the stronghold.<a href=\"#n41\" name=\"nb41\" class=\"note\">41</a> </p> "},{"title":"Textual tradition","index":6,"parent_index":2,"body":" <p>According to Bon lore recorded in <span class=\"popular emph\">Tisé Karchak</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">Ti se dkar chag</span> by <span class=\"popular\">Karru Drupwang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dkar ru grub dbang</span>, <span class=\"popular\">J iu</span><span class=\"scholar\">Byi’u</span>, known as <span class=\"popular\">Jakyip</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bya skyibs brag</span> (Bird Shelter Formation), was visited by great Bon saints circa the 11th and 12th century CE: “On Bird Shelter Formation there is the religious practice cave of <span class=\"popular\">Guru Nöntsé</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ru rnon rtse</span>, <span class=\"popular\">Dampa Bumjé</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dam pa ’bum rje</span> and [<span class=\"popular\">Patön</span><span class=\"scholar\">Spa ston</span>] <span class=\"popular\">Tsengyel</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bstan rgyal</span> [<span class=\"popular\">Zangpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bzang po</span>].

The radical recasting of the site since that time now makes the task of assessment virtually impossible. As of 2002, the east side of the summit was under the complete domination of the monastery. Other sections of the hilltop, however, appeared to host the obscured remains of a defense facility. There were structural traces of a 1-m-thick circumvallating parapet wall on various parts of the rim of the summit. There were also vestiges of what were probably ramparts on the abrupt west and north flanks of the formation. On the southeast side of the hill, sections of revetments up to 2 m in height were extant. Some vestiges of these defensive works are still in situ. A considerable amount of stone rubble was found on the summit and spilling down the east, west and south sides of the hill. Now the rubble has been cleared and the entire hilltop has been given over to Buddhist activities. Several monastic residences were built from the structural detritus of the old fortress on the flat west summit. Some of these houses were destroyed before living memory and others reportedly built just 60 years ago. All buildings on the west summit were recently razed and are now undergoing reconstruction. </p> <hr class=\"footnote-divider\" /> "},{"title":"Notes","index":9,"parent_index":0,"body":" <div class=\"footnote\"> <a name=\"n41\" /> <a href=\"#nb41\" class=\"note\"> [41] </a> Historical information on the <span class=\"popular\">J iu</span><span class=\"scholar\">Byi’u</span>locale is also recorded in <span class=\"popular\">Guge Tsering Gyelpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ge tshe ring rgyal po</span>, <span class=\"popular emph\">Ngari Chömjung Gangjong Dzegyen</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">Mnga’ ris chos ’byung gangs ljongs mdzes rgyan</span> (Lha sa: <span class=\"popular\">Bö Jong Mimang Petrün Khang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bod ljongs mi dmangs dpe skrun khang</span>. 2006), 152.
