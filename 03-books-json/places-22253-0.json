Renowned for both its artistic and literary achievements, it was home to Nepalese artisans painting murals, teams of scribes creating fine volumes of Buddhist canonical literature, and a lively community of scholars, monks, and yogic practitioners from throughout Tibet.</p><p>Most sources agree that <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Zhalu Monastery</span> was established in the early decades of the eleventh century, when <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Chetsün Sherap Jungné</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">lce btsun shes rab ’byung gnas</span></em>) built the original <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Serkhang Tramo</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">gser khang khra mo</span></em>) temple. Though sources differ regarding the exact date, the <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Serkhang Tramo</span> was most likely begun in 1027, and by 1045 there were a number of temples surrounding it. During the 1030s <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Chetsün Sherap Jungné</span> traveled to Bodhgāya, where he met his Indian master. Along the way he traveled through the Kathmandu Valley, where he secured patronage from Nepalese royalty for further building at <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Zhalu</span>.</p><p>The institution underwent periodic expansion for the next several centuries, including a substantial renovation by <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Drakpa Gyeltsen</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">grags pa rgyal mtshan</span></em>) of the Kuzhang (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">sku zhang</span></em>) noble lineage, a family with close relations to the <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Sakyapa</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">sa skya pa</span></em>). These renovations were completed in the 1330s under <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Zhalu</span>’s most famous abbot, <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Butön Rinchendrup</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">bu ston rin chen grub</span></em>, 1290-1364). <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Butön</span> arrived at <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Zhalu</span> in 1322 at the invitation of the Kuzhang rulers, and served as abbot until his death. His tenure marks the golden age of <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Zhalu</span> – a period of great cultural activity that secured the institution’s reputation even in centuries of relative inactivity. History remembers few figures after <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Butön</span>, although <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Zhalu Lotsawa Chökyong Zangpo</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">zhwa lu lo tsā wa chos skyong bzang po</span></em>, 1441-1528) is remembered for his important contributions to the study of Indian language arts in Tibet.</p><p>Today <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Zhalu</span> remains one of only a handful of central Tibetan monasteries containing original art dating from the fourteenth century, though only thirty or so monks reside there, and the library is all but gone.</p>",
