The site is situated on the northern edge of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"popular\">Dam</span><span class=\"scholar\">&rsquo;Dam</span> basin, near the foot of the <span class=\"popular\">Nyenchen Tanglha</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gnyan chen thang lha</span>range. The terrain is loamy\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand studded in <span class=\"popular emph\">drama</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">gra ma</span> brush. The site enjoys wide views to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe south, east and west. <span class=\"popular\">Deuruk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rde&rsquo;u rug</span> is divided\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinto a lower sector (Funerary structures FS13 to FS29) and an upper sector (Funerary structures FS1 to FS12). The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlower sector (4330 m to 4340 m) is found on the edge of the <span class=\"popular\">Dam</span><span class=\"scholar\">&rsquo;Dam</span> basin on gently sloping, slightly elevated ground. It is mainly comprised of quadrate mounds\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tequally elevated on all sides. These tumuli, at least superficially, resemble those found all throughout central\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand southern Tibet. The upper sector (4350 m to 4360 m) is found on a steeply\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinclined slope directly above the lower sector. The upper sector mostly contains quadrate terraced structures that\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\texhibit large differences between the heights of the forward and rear flanks. The terracing of the upper sector\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttombs is primarily the result of the steep gradient of the site. These stepped structures appear to be closely\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tallied to the mounds of the lower sector, in terms of function and age. There is an elevation continuum at the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsite indicating that the two basic structural forms of <span class=\"popular\">Deuruk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rde&rsquo;u rug</span> are closely interrelated. The siting of the tombs and the way in which they have eroded over\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttime also suggests that they form an integral cultural facility. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The funerary structures of <span class=\"popular\">Deuruk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rde&rsquo;u rug</span> are\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgenerally aligned in the cardinal directions. This alignment, however, is not always discernable because of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\textreme erosion and deliberate destruction of the mounds. Some structures are so degraded as to resemble hillocks\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcovered in <span class=\"popular emph\">drama</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">gra ma</span> brush and other vegetation. Funerary\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstructure FS1 is the only specimen at the site to still have exterior masonry wall fragments. These walls are\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\taligned in the compass points. The tombs of <span class=\"popular\">Deuruk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rde&rsquo;u rug</span> taper inwards towards the top, a design feature that increases their stability. The large size\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the funerary structures (64 m&sup2; to 148 m&sup2;) indicates that this was a burial ground for a powerful, high status\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsocial group. The existence of <span class=\"popular\">Deuruk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rde&rsquo;u rug</span> and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tother significant funerary sites in <span class=\"popular\">Damzhung</span><span class=\"scholar\">&rsquo;Dam gzhung</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(D-4, D-100, D-101, D-102, D-103) shows that this region once had an important political and economic stature. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"popular\">Deuruk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rde&rsquo;u rug</span> has been hard hit by illegal\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\texcavations and pilferage. In the Chinese Cultural Revolution, extensive excavations of the tumuli took place,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tleading to the loss of much of the archaeological value of the site. Even in recent years excavations have\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcontinued. Reportedly, in March of 2004, a group of Chinese, unknown to local residents, carried out excavations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tModern penetrations reveal that the interior of the mounds contain significant quantities of stones. Local\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tresidents agree that the mounds enshrine human bones and that valuable artifacts have been discovered in them. It\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tis said that patterned agates, coral and silver objects have been recovered. For the most part, these artifacts\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmake their way onto the arts and antiquities market. In addition to the excavations of the modern period, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\texistence of hardened depressions covered in <span class=\"popular emph\">drama</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">gra ma</span> brush\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tindicates that looting also took place at <span class=\"popular emph\">Deuruk</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rde&rsquo;u rug</span> well in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe past.

The uphill/north side of FS1 has a height of 1 m to 1.5 m, while the forward/south side is elevated\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tperhaps 7 m above the downhill slope. The actual height of the forward flank of FS1 is difficult to ascertain\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause of the high level of erosion. Like other specimens at the site, the base of this terraced funerary\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstructure imperceptibly blends into the slope. There is some structural evidence to suggest that the top 3 m\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tor 4 m of the forward flank of FS1 was a vertical expanse (if so, it must have been sheathed in stonework). On\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe west rim of the tomb there is a partly intact masonry wall (13 m long), 25 cm in height.
