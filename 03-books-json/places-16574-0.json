To the west the site is bounded by the <span class=\"popular\">Hur</span><span class=\"scholar\">Hur</span> (sp.?) valley, which still has a perennial source of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twater. The <span class=\"popular\">Hur</span><span class=\"scholar\">Hur</span>watercourse probably extended further\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tup valley at one time, providing a fairly convenient source of water for the facility.

Its lofty and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\taustere location is typical of archaic cultural horizon installations, as are its prominent revetments and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstonework. There are just a few caves in the vicinity of <span class=\"popular\">Shiri M&ouml;n Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Shi ri mon mkhar</span>, indicating that this was not a major nucleus of settlement. It\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tis likely to have been inhabited by a political and/or religious elite. Although there is a lack of ramparts and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tother outlying defensive works (possibly these have been eradicated by the failure of the slopes), the flanks of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe formation are steep, providing the facility with a quite respectable defensive posture. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"popular\">Shiri M&ouml;n Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Shi ri mon mkhar</span> is said by <span class=\"popular\">Shangts&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Shang rtse</span> township elders to have been an ancient\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span> castle.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Site elements","index":6,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Castle","index":7,"parent_index":6,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"popular\">Shiri M&ouml;n Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Shi ri mon mkhar</span> consists of a single\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tedifice (10 m x 9 m), which appears to have had both north and south entrances. It is composed of random-work\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twalls that contain copious amounts of a light-colored clay-based mortar. Variable-sized pieces of sandstone and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconglomerate (up to 1 m in length) were used in construction. <span class=\"popular\">Shiri M&ouml;n Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Shi ri mon mkhar</span>, like many other archaic strongholds, is set on prominent\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trevetments. The maximum extant height of the structure is 4 m, nearly all of which is made up by a revetment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPartially intact wall footings suggest that <span class=\"popular\">Shiri M&ouml;n Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Shi ri mon mkhar</span> was divided into at least four rooms. Freestanding wall fragments are now no more that\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t70 cm in height. No interior wall partitions have survived. On the west side of the structure there is a lower\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trevetment (1 m high), which extends out laterally for 1 m. Above the lower revetment there is an upper revetment\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(2 m high). On the north side of <span class=\"popular\">Shiri M&ouml;n Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Shi ri mon mkhar</span> the revetment is up to 3.2 m in height. On the south side of the edifice the revetment is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\taround 2 m in height. On the east flank of <span class=\"popular\">Shiri M&ouml;n Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Shi ri mon mkhar</span> a two-tiered revetment has a vertical expanse of 4 m. Thick buttressing against the east\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trevetment may indicate that a smaller superstructure was appended to this side of the main edifice. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The standing walls of the castle superstructure are 60 cm to 75 cm in thickness. At the south entrance (1 m\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twide) a standing wall fragment is up to 1.1 m thick. The south entrance appears to have led to a landing that\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmay have been at a slightly lower elevation than the adjacent rooms. The south portion of the edifice has an\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tunclear floor plan. It appears to have contained two rooms. The north half of the structure appears to be\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcomprised of two rooms as well, separated from one another by a corridor. The east room has internal proportions\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof 1.1 m x 2.6 m, and the west room is of similar proportions. The corners of these two compartments are\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trounded, a design feature reminiscent of <span class=\"popular emph\">do khang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rdo khang</span>.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"popular\">Shiri M&ouml;n Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Shi ri mon mkhar</span>may well have been\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof an all-stone composition, however, there is very little structural evidence left to assess. No roof\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tappurtenances are found on the site. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>On the west side of the castle edifice there is an interconnected curtain-wall, protecting it from incursions\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\toriginating in the north (the direction from which there is the easiest access to the site). The top of this\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twall lies below the base of the edifice. Its western extremity rests upon a 2-m high revetment (3.2 m in length)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat forms a small platform. Beyond this point the formation drops off abruptly. The somewhat sinuous\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcurtain-wall is 11 m long, up to 2.7 m in height and around 60 cm in thickness. It is possible that this\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcurtain-wall was part of a more extensive enclosed structure, but if so, all traces have vanished. Interspersed\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin the curtain-wall are three triangular windows or loopholes, around 40 cm in height and with a base width of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t20 cm. Two of them are lined with stone slabs. The presence of triangular apertures in <span class=\"popular\">Shiri M&ouml;n Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Shi ri mon mkhar</span> suggests that this <span class=\"popular\">Gug&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ge</span> design feature predates the <span class=\"popular emph\">tsenpa chidar</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">btsan pa phyi dar</span>. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n"}]}
