Thin blocks and slabs up to 80 cm in length were used in construction. The exterior faces of these stones appear to have been hewn flat.

It was constructed on a level piece of ground in between two gullies. This structure seems to have had four very small south rooms, all of which have been leveled. There are also two much better preserved north rooms with wall segments up to 1.5 m in height. The northeast room has a few in situ corbels resting on he walls. The internal height of the northwest room is 1.3 m but some infilling is likely to have occurred over time. Bearing down on the corbels in the northwest room are several sheathing slabs up to 1 m in length.

It appears to have consisted of two iers of small rooms. Slabs and bridging stones are strewn around the site. One bridging stone, (1.3 m in length) cut to have four even sides, is found among them. The rear wall of RS2 was deeply built into a steep and rocky slope. On the northwest side of the rear wall, a few corbels and roof slabs are in place. On the east side of the rear wall there is a recess covered with stone slabs. Part of the roof still covers what was probably the central rear room; this room has been almost completely filled with earth and rubble. </p> "},{"title":"Residential Structure RS3","index":10,"parent_index":7,"body":" <p>Residential structure RS3 is located 9.5 m east of RS2.
