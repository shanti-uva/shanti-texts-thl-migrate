Spoken Tibetan makes indiscriminate use of verb stem forms that correspond to the “future” and the “present” in Literary Tibetan, and at the most only distinguishes between two tenses: the <strong>past</strong> and the <strong>present-future</strong>. While some verbs also have a distinctive imperative stem, in most cases this stem resembles either the present-future or the past. Very often, the verb is quite simply <strong>invariable</strong>.</p> <p class=\"Paragraph\">The large number of invariable verbs means that inflection is practically redundant in the spoken language. Tenses are formed by using a system of auxiliaries.</p> <p class=\"Paragraph\">For more information, see the entry on verb inflection in the appendices to this Reference Grammar.</p>","title":""}]}
