It consists of three valleys intersecting in a common juncture: <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Shongy&uuml;l</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">gshong yul lung pa</span></em>), <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Mangy&uuml;l</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">mang yul lung pa</span></em>), and the valley with its lower part called <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Halung</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">ha lung lung pa</span></em>) and upper part called <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kyinkhor</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">dkyil 'khor</span></em>). The township seat is located at the juncture, and is generally referred to as &ldquo;Wendu,&rdquo; although it is close to the village of Rashong, which people treat synonymously with it. There are roughly twenty villages located throughout the township, and livelihoods are mostly based upon agriculture.

The stated reason is that they do not want &ldquo;outsiders&rdquo; to host these important communal activities, and thus not a single committee member of the organizational group is from <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kyinkhor</span>, while all the other villages take turns hosting the event. <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Mangy&uuml;l</span> Valley is also called \"<span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Rigongwar</span>\" (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">ri sgong bar</span></em>).</p>\n"},{"title":"Religion","index":2,"parent_index":0,"body":"\n<p class=\"Paragraph\">Most villages adhere to the <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Geluk</span> (<em><span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">dge lugs</span></em>) sect.&nbsp; The largest monastery is now a <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Geluk</span> monastery (formerly it was&nbsp;<span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Sakya</span>, <em><span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">sa skya</span></em>) located in <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Shongy&uuml;l</span> valley.
