This ridge rings a portion of the <span class=\"popular\">Tarap Tso<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Rta rabs mtsho<\/span> basin. From the site there are fairly open views in all directions. At least 11 funerary structures, many of which appear to have been cubic graves, are situated on the northeast-southwest running rocky spine. There are also the traces of walls and at least one enclosure at <span class=\"popular\">Paktuk<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Pags mthug<\/span>. The tombs and other structures are spread out over more than 1 km along the talus-blanketed ridgeback. Many of them are so deteriorated that they have been almost reabsorbed into the depositions of talus. The cubic tombs among them appear to have been of standard design and construction. All structures at the site are made of variable-length (30 cm to 80 cm long) reddish and purplish slabs of volcanic talus. These funerary structures are closely associated spatially and functionally with a small array of pillars appended to an edifice (C-158). These monuments constitute two distinctive components of what appears to have been an integrated (functionally and chronologically) necropolis. On high ground around the <span class=\"popular\">Tarap Tso<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Rta rabs mtsho<\/span> basin here are four other sites of the cubic tomb typology (E-8, E-17, E-18, E-19).<\/p> "},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":" <p>According to the folklore of <span class=\"popular\">Oma<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">&rsquo;O ma<\/span>, there was once a local chieftain who was extremely fond of wild yak (<span class=\"popular emph\">drong<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">&rsquo;brong<\/span>) hunting. One day because of all his killing there were no wild yaks left in the region. In order to survive he was reduced to boiling the skins of wild yaks and eating them.

In addition to the outer perimeter walls, there appears to be a rectangular inner enclosure (1 m across) that is also composed of upright stones. <\/p>  "}]}
