At\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tleast 11 funerary structures, many of which appear to have been cubic graves, are situated on the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnortheast-southwest running rocky spine. There are also the traces of walls and at least one enclosure at\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"popular\">Paktuk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Pags mthug</span>. The tombs and other structures are\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tspread out over more than 1 km along the talus-blanketed ridgeback. Many of them are so deteriorated that they\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thave been almost reabsorbed into the depositions of talus. The cubic tombs among them appear to have been of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstandard design and construction. All structures at the site are made of variable-length (30 cm to 80 cm long)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\treddish and purplish slabs of volcanic talus. These funerary structures are closely associated spatially and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfunctionally with a small array of pillars appended to an edifice (C-158). These monuments constitute two\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdistinctive components of what appears to have been an integrated (functionally and chronologically) necropolis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOn high ground around the <span class=\"popular\">Tarap Tso</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rta rabs mtsho</span> basin\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthere are four other sites of the cubic tomb typology (E-8, E-17, E-18, E-19).</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>According to the folklore of <span class=\"popular\">Oma</span><span class=\"scholar\">&rsquo;O ma</span>, there was once a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlocal chieftain who was extremely fond of wild yak (<span class=\"popular emph\">drong</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">&rsquo;brong</span>)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thunting.
