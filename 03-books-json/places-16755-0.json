It was built on level, sandy ground near the foot of a range of hills. FS2 measures 14.2 m (north-south) x 9.1 m (east-west), but it is not very well aligned in the cardinal directions. The structure is slightly elevated above the surrounding plain, on its downhill flank. The walls of the quadrate enclosure are double-course (60 cm to 1 m thick) and built mostly with larger blocks and slabs (50 cm to 1.1 m long). Some of the stones of he walls are flush with the ground surface, but many project prominently above it to a maximum height of 40 cm. The enclosure appears to have been divided into two unequal parts by an east-west running wall. There may have been other walls further subdividing the enclosure but not enough is intact to know for certain. Parts of all four perimeter walls are missing due to the predations of the local population. Stones have been recently extracted in order to build a corral. <\/p> "},{"title":"Funerary Structure FS3","index":10,"parent_index":7,"body":" <p>Funerary structure FS3 (22.917&#900; \/ 44.832&#900; 4630 m) is located south of FS2 in close proximity. Only poorly preserved vestiges of the enclosure (approximately 13 m x 4.7 m) are left. An integral wall fragment (4.7 m long x 80 cm thick) of the enclosure has endured. This double-course wall fragment is primarily made up of blocky stones around 20 cm in length, which are flush with the ground surface or protrude above it to a height of 30 cm. On the west side of the structure there are the remains of a smaller enclosure (1.8 m x 1.1 m) that is liable to have had a funerary ritual function. It is also made of smaller stones that are flush with the ground surface or that are slightly raised above it. This ancillary structure appears to have had double-course perimeter walls. <\/p> "},{"title":"Funerary Structure FS4","index":11,"parent_index":7,"body":" <p>Funerary structure FS4 (22.881&#900; \/ 44.806&#900;) appears to have been roughly aligned in the compass points. This highly fragmentary structure may have been around 9 m long (north-south). An east-west wall fragment (5.8 m long) connects to a lesser wall fragment (3.2 m long) to create an L-shaped remnant. These double-course walls are around 60 cm thick. The stones of the walls are flush with the ground level or rise above it to a maximum height of 30 cm. <\/p> "},{"title":"Funerary Structures FS5, FS6 and FS7","index":12,"parent_index":7,"body":" <p>Funerary structures FS5, FS6 and FS7 (4610 m) form a compact northwest-southwest running row of structures situated at slightly lower elevation than their counterparts to the north. They are likely to represent an integrated funerary unit. The three enclosures were built with stones (20 cm to 50 cm long) that project 10 cm o 30 cm above the ground surface. <\/p> <p>Funerary structure FS5 (22.889&#900; \/ 44.867&#900;) is a small quadrate structure (2.1 m x 2.2 m), which is generally aligned in the cardinal directions. The perimeter of the structure is elevated about 20 cm above the surrounding plain. Many small pieces of blue-gray limestone are found strewn on top. This limestone residuum must have formed a structural element of FS5. Funerary structure FS6 (4 m x 4 m) does not appear to be aligned in the cardinal directions (22.886&#900; \/ 44.871&#900;). The entire structure is elevated about 50 cm above the surrounding terrain. It is mostly composed of smaller stones, however, its perimeter walls have been largely destroyed. Funerary structure FS7 (22.883&#900; \/ 44.878&#900;) is roughly aligned in the compass points and measures 5 m (east-west) x 6.9 m (north-south). These dimensions represent what may have been just the west cell of the structure. There may also have been a contiguous east cell but the structural evidence is inconclusive. The hree partially intact perimeter walls are 80 cm to 90 cm in thickness, and contain mostly blocky stones (20 cm to 50 cm long). In the north wall there are sections made up of two vertical courses of blocks laid flat. These walls reach a maximum height of 30 cm above ground level. <\/p> "},{"title":"Funerary Structure FS8","index":13,"parent_index":7,"body":null},{"title":"Funerary Structure FS9","index":14,"parent_index":7,"body":" <p>Funerary structure FS9 (approximately 11.5 m x 7 m) is found near a hill enclosing the east side of <span class=\"popular\">Dziden<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Brdzi gdan<\/span> (coordinates are not available).
