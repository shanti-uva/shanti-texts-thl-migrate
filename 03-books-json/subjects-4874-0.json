This reads something like \"I, so-and-so, wrote this at such-and-such place, at such-and-such time, at the request of so-and-so\" etc. The presence of any such parts of the statement identify the section as an author’s colophon. Often, the statement of authorship is found in the Closing section (see below). Such closing info usually uses the same formulaic grammar and sometimes the different Kangyurs or Tengyurs name different authors, which, moreover, can differ from the author attributions in the Chinese collections as well. It may be that most of such author colophons are often just traditional attributions rather than having actually been written by the authors.</p>","title":"An Overview of the Author’s Colophon Section"}]}
