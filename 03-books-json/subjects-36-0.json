A village is usually larger than a hamlet, but smaller than a town, which in turn is smaller than a city.Â  Historically, a typical village may have been five to thirty families in size, but in modern times can be quite a bit larger. The trend of urbanization sparked by the Industrial revolution has led to many villages developing into towns or cities.</p>
