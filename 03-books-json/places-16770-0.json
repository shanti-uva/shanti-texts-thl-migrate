The site is situated on level ground spotted\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twith turf, gravel and stones, which rises a little above the flood plain of the river.

These walls contain variable length (20 cm to 70 cm long) blocks and, to a lesser degree, slabs, most of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhich appear to have been laid flat on the ground. Some stones used in construction may have been dressed. These\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tenclosures appear to have been heavily disturbed sometime in the past. Most of the enclosing walls are severely\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdenuded of stones, and many of those stones that remain on the site are not fixed in their original\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconfigurations. Furthermore, larger stone members lying on the surface are of the type regularly employed in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsubsurface architecture of Upper Tibetan tombs. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>None was collected.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Site elements","index":6,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Southeast sector","index":7,"parent_index":6,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Funerary structure FS1 (5 m x 8.5 m) is elevated to a maximum height of 50 cm above the plain (29&deg; 33.032&#900;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tN. lat. / 84&deg; 57.296&#900; E. long.).
