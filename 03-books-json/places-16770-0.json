The northern end of the site is within one-half km of <span class=\"popular\">Beltsa Gyangtrok Doring<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Bal tshwa gyang khrog rdo ring<\/span> (C-82), and these two monuments are likely to be functionally interrelated (insomuch as walled pillars are often found near funerary structures). <span class=\"popular\">Beltsa Gyangtrok<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Bal tshwa gyang khrog<\/span> consists of 17 well-built but highly dissolute rectangular and sub-rectangular funerary superstructures spread out over a transection of one-half km. Most of hese enclosures appear to have had single-course perimeter walls, but there is also evidence for double-course walls. These walls contain variable length (20 cm to 70 cm long) blocks and, to a lesser degree, slabs, most of which appear to have been laid flat on the ground. Some stones used in construction may have been dressed. These enclosures appear to have been heavily disturbed sometime in the past. Most of the enclosing walls are severely denuded of stones, and many of those stones that remain on the site are not fixed in their original configurations. Furthermore, larger stone members lying on the surface are of the type regularly employed in the subsurface architecture of Upper Tibetan tombs. <\/p> "},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":" <p>None was collected.<\/p> "},{"title":"Site elements","index":6,"parent_index":2,"body":" "},{"title":"Southeast sector","index":7,"parent_index":6,"body":null},{"title":"Northwest sector","index":8,"parent_index":6,"body":" <ol> <li>Funerary structure FS14 (10.7 m x 8.2 m) is elevated 50 cm to 70 cm above the surrounding terrain (33.309&#900; \/ 57.145&#900;).
