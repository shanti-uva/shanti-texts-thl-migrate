Later he lived as\n                              a yogi in the mountains. During this period everyone said he had gone\n                              mad because he would sit for long periods staring into space. Once,\n                              while he was meditating, a beautiful young woman came to him and asked\n                              him if he was going to visit his teacher. On his inquiring where his\n                              teacher was to be found, the woman replied that he was in the upper\n                              part of the same valley. Here he found a cave containing a woven nest\n                              of silken thread. In this nest was a tiny creature like a monkey which\n                              offered him a bronze bowl and told him to drink from it. He did so,\n                              and immediately achieved illumination. </p>\n\n                        </blockquote>\n\n                        <p>After returning to scholarly life, he held a discussion with a certain Se\n                           bon &rsquo;khro rgyal on certain matters of philosophy. So impressed was he by\n                           the bla ma&rsquo;s knowledge that he decided to study under his teacher, &rsquo;Or\n                           sgom kun &rsquo;dul. After &rsquo;Or sgom kun &rsquo;dul had initiated Shes rab rgyal\n                           mtshan into a part of the Zhang zhung snyan rgyud, he instructed him to\n                           go to Upper mNga&rsquo; ris, where he would have two sons and would receive\n                           many disciples.

After discussing the perseverance\n                           shown by many notable scholars in trying to find their bla mas, he\n                           praises them for adhering to their quest &ldquo;without giving a thought to\n                           hardship or suffering&rdquo;:</p>\n\n                        <blockquote xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\">\n                           <p>For example, we should follow the manner of the Great Yang ston&rsquo;s\n                              search for Rong rTog med zhig po. That bla ma, the Great Yang ston,\n                              was thoroughly learned in the Bon doctrines of the Shegyu, and on one\n                              occasion a woman appeared to him him saying, &ldquo;How learned are\n                              you?&rdquo;</p>\n\n                           <p>&ldquo;I am completely learned,&rdquo; he replied, whereupon the woman began\n                              weeping and departed unhappily.

Just to\n                              hear this the Great Yang ston&rsquo;s heart was so filled with joy that he\n                              forgot to ask where the bla ma was.

Historical documents, known as bemcha,\n                           from Panchgaon, confirm that surrounding villages were obliged to pay\n                           relatively heavy taxes to Thini. Thus Pha lag and Dang dga&rsquo; rdzong had to\n                           pay Thini nine large baskets of meat annually, while nearby Sangdak\n                           provided eight male goats in their second year. dGe lung had to make an\n                           annual payment of one adult bull yak and one yak calf. Marpha had to pay\n                           its taxes in the form of unpaid labour. Every year, ten young men would\n                           come from Marpha to Thini, bringing their own farming implements and\n                           animals, to plough Thini&rsquo;s fields, and ten young women would come to do\n                           the weeding. Even Manang had to pay annual tribute to its powerful\n                           neighbour. One document from Thini gives the following account of\n                           events:</p>\n\n                        <blockquote xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\">\n                           <p>Yang ston Bla ma of Dolpo asked the headmen and constables of gSum\n                              dGa&rsquo; rab rdzong to give him the land of Klu brag.

These investments and the interest that must be paid by each of\n                        the estates are recorded in a register of temple contributions referred to\n                        as the ma yig, the &ldquo;record of capital&rdquo;. The documents in question are in the\n                        form of sheets of coarse paper measuring 9.5 inches by 8.5 inches sewn\n                        together along the centre and folded horizontally to make a booklet. The two\n                        booklets are not, however, the original documents, but were copied from an\n                        earlier scroll by an educated bla ma from Mustang who lived in Klu brag for\n                        a short time at the request of the villagers. Households listed in the text\n                        are identified by the heads of each, and the names in the register refer to\n                        men who occupied this position in the last generation. The copies are\n                        therefore compratively recent, and the fact that they have been updated\n                        unfortunately makes it impossible to draw many inferences about the village\n                        as it would have been during the time of the document&rsquo;s original\n                        composition. The type of patronage revealed by the register is not based on\n                        a private relationship between a bla ma and a lay householder, but embraces\n                        any number of people who wish to confer their patronage on the Klu brag\n                        temple and its community of bla mas. This system itself has two sightly\n                        varying forms. The first of these is apparently an earlier method and\n                        operates as follows. </p>\n\n                     <p>If someone from a neighboring village loses a close relative, he or she may\n                        wish to bestow a certain amount of money on a religious institution in order\n                        that prayers be said and lamps lit to generate merit for the deceased. Such\n                        donations are known as sbyar mchog and are collected until the total is\n                        sufficient for the establishment of a ritual. Originally the money used to\n                        be divided up into eight equal portions and each portion given to one of the\n                        grong pa. This sum was used by that grong pa as capital (a ma) with which to\n                        trade, and interest to the value of ten per cent of the capital was\n                        contributed towards purchasing the foodstuffs necessary for the ceremony.\n                        Sometimes the sum given to each householder was not the same, and the form\n                        in which the interest was to be paid frequently differed, but these\n                        variations are all recorded in the register and must still be paid as they\n                        are entered.The names and perhaps the motives (usually the death of the\n                        named relative) were probably recorded in the original register, but the\n                        more recent booklets contain only details of the original contributions\n                        required of each household, and make provision for the new ninth grong pa.\n                        Rituals that are financed by this method are referred to as the &lsquo;old\n                        ceremonies&rsquo; (mchod pa rnying pa), and these are contained in the first of\n                        the two ma yig booklets. </p>\n\n                     <p>Whereas the recipients of the patronage used to be the grong pa, the money\n                        is now distributed among the &lsquo;monks&rsquo; (grwa pa) and nuns (jo mo). &lsquo;Monks&rsquo; in\n                        this case still refers to village bla mas and the money continues to be\n                        invested in household trade, but a household with two bla mas (for example,\n                        an extended household occupied by a father and his eldest son) or with a\n                        resident nun will be given a proportionately larger share of the capital.\n                        The system may be represented by a simple diagram. Let us suppose that at a\n                        certain point in time there are five priests or nuns in Klu brag&rsquo;s religious\n                        community \\(in fact there are now fifteen), each represented in order of age\n                        by a letter. To simplify matters, it may be assumed that the sum of money\n                        collected as sbyar mchog is fifty rupees, and each person is consequently\n                        required to pay commodities to the value of one rupee per year as interest.\n                        The amount payable is represented by a number following each letter: </p>\n\n\n                     <table class=\"essay-table\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\"><tr xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\">\n                           <td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\">A1</td>\n                           <td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\">B1 </td>\n                           <td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\">C1</td>\n                           <td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\">D1</td>\n                           <td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\">E1</td>\n                        </tr></table>\n\n                     <p>When a monk or a nun dies his or her payment of the interest ceases. But the\n                        terms of receiving sbyar mchog from patrons are that the ritual be\n                        perpetuated on as grand a scale as the capital permits, and the onus of the\n                        deceased&rsquo;s temple contributions is transferred to the two youngest members\n                        of the community.
