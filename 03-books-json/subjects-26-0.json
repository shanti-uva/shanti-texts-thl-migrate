   "body": "<p>An \"agricultural estate\" is a very small political entity organized around estates in agricultural areas led by civil leaders. These leaders, or manor lords, were referred to by a variety of Tibetan titles - mnga' bdag che(n) po, nang so, sgar ba, stong dpon, rgya dpon, 'go ba, and so forth. Each ruled an estate,which can be considered polities since they held the power of taxation and such, without, as far as we can tell, having to send it up to higher authorities, as in central Tibet.</p>
<p>In Tibet, there were three primary types of small scale political entities that were larger than simply a single self-sufficient village, but smaller than any broad regional polity formation: agricultural estates, nomadic trival areas, and monastic parishes.</p>
