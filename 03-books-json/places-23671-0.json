During the Imperial Period the key population and cultural center of Kham, which at that time was called Kham Longtang (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">khams klong thang<\/span><\/em>), was Denkok (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">\u2019dan khog<\/span><\/em> or <em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ldan khog<\/span><\/em>). The very old Longtang T\u0101r\u0101 Temple (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">sgrol ma lha khang<\/span><\/em>) in Denkhok is said to have been built by Songtsen Gampo (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">srong btsan sgam po<\/span><\/em>) in the seventh century as one of the numerous edifices constructed to pin down the Supine Demoness of Tibetan geomancy.<\/p><p>Lingtsang was a very important polity during the Sakya-Mongol period. The Yuan Dynasty bureau charged with Tibetan affairs established three major districts (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">chol kha<\/span><\/em>; \u5ba3\u6170\u53f8 <em><span class=\"chinese\" title=\"Type ID here\">xuanwei si<\/span><\/em>) in Tibet and Ch\u00f6gyel Pakpa (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">chos rgyal \u2019phags pa<\/span><\/em>) appointed the head of the Lingtsang family \u2013 who was a monk \u2013 as the great chief (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">dpon chen<\/span><\/em>; \u5ba3\u6170\u4f7f\u90fd\u5143\u5e05 <em><span class=\"chinese\" title=\"Type ID here\">xuanwei shi duyuanshuai<\/span><\/em>) of the Dom\u00e9, or Amdo, district (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">mdo smad chol kha<\/span><\/em>).<\/p><p>After the fall of the Sakya hegemon in 1350, Lingtsang became an independent kingdom. The biographies of the fourth and fifth Karmapas make several mentions of dealings with the chief of Lingtsang. The relations between Lingtsang and Ming China were formed during the reign of Yongle (r. 1402-1424); Ming emperors needed the cooperation of local leaders in Kham to secure safe access to Tibet for Ming diplomatic and trade caravans. In 1407 the Ming court invested the leader of Lingtsang (this position was still held by monks and lamas), with two titles: State Master of Consecration (\u704c\u9876\u56fd\u5e08 <em><span class=\"chinese\" title=\"Type ID here\">guanding guoshi<\/span><\/em>) and Religious King of Promoting Goodness (\u8d5e\u5584\u6559\u738b <em><span class=\"chinese\" title=\"Type ID here\">zanshan jiaowang<\/span><\/em>). During the Qing dynasty the patriarchs of Lingtsang were given the title of indigenous headmen (\u571f\u53f8 <em><span class=\"chinese\" title=\"Type ID here\">tusi<\/span><\/em>). In Tibetan historical documents the leaders of Ling are usually called Ling Guzi Gyelpo (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">gling \u2019gu zi rgyal po<\/span><\/em>) or Lingtsang Gyelpo (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">gling tshang rgyal po<\/span><\/em>). In 1909 the Sichuan provincial government made Lingtsang a part of a Chinese administered Deg\u00e9 (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">sde dge<\/span><\/em>), thus bringing to an end over 600 years of an independent or autonomous polity.<\/p><p>The precise geographical extent of Lingtsang is not documented but it is known that the future capital of Deg\u00e9 and regions further south were under the control of Ling through the middle of the seventeenth century. The rise of the Deg\u00e9 kingdom in the 1630s and 40s came at the cost of Lingtsang and by the end of the century Lingtsang was reduced to a small noble house on Deg\u00e9\u2019s northern border. Nevertheless, conflict between Lingtsang and Deg\u00e9 persisted through the beginning of the twentieth century.<\/p>","title":"An Overview of Lingtsang"}]}
