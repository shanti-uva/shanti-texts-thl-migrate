The uphill flank of FS1 is elevated about 1 m above the slope while its downhill flank is elevated about 2.5 m above the adjoining terrain. It is possible that other small funerary structures are found in the vicinity but they have become too integrated in the naturally rolling terrain to positively identify using visual means. <\/p>  "}]}
