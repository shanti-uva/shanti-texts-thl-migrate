In the \"Historical buildings in Lhasa\" table at the back of the book (pp. 165-172), buildings of the \"Monumental official building\" type are designated with the letter \"D\" in the building type column. In the THL Place Dictionary, when a building has this feature type and the <em>Lhasa Atlas</em> is given as the source, it means that the building was designated with a \"D\" in the <em>Lhasa Atlas</em> table.<br /><br />This building type is described as follows:<br /><br />\"<em>D. Monumental official building (palace, fort, military building, governmental production building</em>. Examples: Magshikhang (army headquarters) (296) and Barkhang Chenmo (Gangjan Pende Terdzökhang, printing house) (288).<br /><br />\"Inside Lingkor, the only buildings of this category are the Potala and some in Shöl on the slopes of Marpori\" (p. 60).<br /><br />Source:<br /><br />Larsen, Knud and Amund Sinding-Larsen. <em>The Lhasa Atlas: Traditional Tibetan Architecture and Townscape</em>.
