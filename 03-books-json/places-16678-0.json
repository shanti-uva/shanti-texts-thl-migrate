The site appears to have been flood damaged and there are no signs of other structures in the vicinity of the lone pillar. The nearly level terrain is impacted and stony and supports almost no vegetation. The site is open in all directions, however, in the east the view is somewhat abbreviated by an intervening ridge.<a href=\"#n35\" name=\"nb35\" class=\"note\">35</a> The irregularly shaped bluish pillar now only stands 40 cm above ground level. Reportedly, it was broken before living memory. With a basal girth of only 75 cm, <span class=\"popular\">Garshok Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sgar gshog rdo ring</span> is not likely to have stood much more than 1 m in height. The pillar is inclined in a downhill direction although the terrain is nearly level. Pieces of milky quartz as offerings are piled around it, reflecting the stone’s sacred status. </p>
