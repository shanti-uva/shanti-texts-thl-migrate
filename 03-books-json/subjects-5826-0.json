   "body": "<p class=\"Paragraph\">Most sects of Tibetan Buddhism embraced a packaged integration of exoteric and basic esoteric practices under the heading of “preliminaries” (<span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">sngon ‘gro</span>) to serve as an introduction to advanced Tantric contemplation. As discussed above, their “ordinary” forms rehearsed basic Buddhist doctrine, while their “extraordinary” practices introduced basic Tantric contemplation: going for refuge, generating the altruistic aspiration for enlightenment, Vajrasattva purification, maṇḍala offerings, and Guru Yoga. Practitioners perform each 100,000 times, and thus rehearse the basic Tantric elements of visualization, mantra repetition, somatic sensations, constructions of maṇḍalas, the divinity and primacy of the guru, transformation, offerings, and the importance of divinities.</p>",
