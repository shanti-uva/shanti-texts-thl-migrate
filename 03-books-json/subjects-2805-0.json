Thus our first political period – Empire – is also the time of the birth of the Tibetans as a people and community stretching across the huge geographical extent of the Tibetan plateau.</p> <p>After the gradual disintegration of the empire in the ninth century, the Tibetan plateau and its people were never to again have such overarching political unity. However, the cultural unity fashioned in the cauldron of the Empire was to persist in the form of Tibetan Buddhism and Bön religions, the common literary medium of classical Tibetan, the linked set of spoken languages, and a sense of shared ancestry and destiny as reflected in literature, art, religion, and identity. Politically, however, there are four subsequent very broad periods, each marked by a great diversity of concurrent political formations ranging from a family governing a single valley all the way to regional polities holding some type of authority over a large area. Thus the present scheme of five Tibetan political periods involves naming broad periods after a dominant political structure that holds sway for a lengthy time. The focus is on Central Tibetan areas, since this is historically the political heart of the Tibetan people due to it being the site of the origins of the empire which gave birth to Tibet as an identity, and because the most important centralized political structures over history were usually located there.</p>","title":"An Overview of Tibetan Political Periods"}]}
