Instead, we find the morpheme <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">འམ་</span> and its variants (xxlink to the table called: Variant written forms of grammatical cases and morphemes), or the morpheme <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ཨེ་</span>. Note that the interrogative particle <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ཨེ་</span> is placed before the verb, unlike the other interrogative particles, which go afterward. In the spoken language, <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ཨ་</span>, which is related to <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ཨེ་</span>, has a distinct meaning indicating doubt (not a question).</p>",
