There are two\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsignificant residential complexes sitting on the narrow northern flank of a large knife-edge ridge. By virtue of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir position, these installations receive good eastern and western exposure. Walls were well constructed of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trandom-rubble blocks and slabs averaging 20 cm to 60 cm in length (maximum length: 1 m). Due to the extreme\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdeterioration of most structures, it could not be determined what kind of roof they supported. The very small size\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the rooms is often a characteristic of all-stone corbelled architecture. Whatever mud-mortar was used to cement\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe wall joints has nearly all dissipated. This large and powerful center (approximately 2200 m&sup2;), in terms of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tquality of the stonework, seems to have been unmatched by subsequent architecture in the region.
