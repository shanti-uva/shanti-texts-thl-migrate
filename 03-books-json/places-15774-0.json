But as the religious practitioners did not live according to monastic vows, it was decided that the monastery should be moved to a more isolated spot. Thus A tshogs tshang of A skyid sKyang tshang Monastery bought the present site of the monastery in exchange for a white cow and other goods. The new monastery was named Nyos zhing, literally \u201cfield that was bought\u201d. After the monastery was completed, the monasteries of sKyang tshang, gTso tshang and the local lay community decided that since it was A tshogs tshang who built the monastery, it would remain a branch of sKyang tshang Monastery, but that since it was located nearer gTso tshang, the latter would take charge of the monastery and the chief of the local gZa\u2019 ru tribe would be the monastery\u2019s patron. The agreement was committed to writing and signed by all parties.

He was one of the Three Bonpo Saints of Amdo and founded Thang zhing gYung drung gling Monastery above Thang zhing village in the 2nd Rab byung (1087-1146).

Although the sKyang \u2019phags lineage in mDa\u2019 chen Monastery has survived to this day, the Sources concerning its history are no longer available, and the dates of many of the masters remain unknown. Following is a list of the masters of mDa\u2019 chen \u2019og ma, \u201cthe Lower mDa\u2019 chen\u201d lineage who looked after the monastery: <\/p><ol type=\"1\"> <li>sKyang \u2019phags Nam mkha\u2019 g-yung drung<\/li> <li>Rang grol Bla ma rgyal mtshan<\/li> <li>Gling zhig Shes rab g-yung drung<\/li> <li>Gling zhig rGyal ba bstan \u2019dzin<\/li> <li>Gling zhig rNam rgyal grags pa<\/li> <li>Tshul khrims rgyal mtshan<\/li> <li>Rin chen rgyal mtshan<\/li> <li>Nam mkha\u2019 ye shes<\/li> <li>bSod nams ye shes<\/li> <li>gYung drung phun tshogs<\/li> <li>Shes rab \u2019od zer<\/li> <li>Nam mkha\u2019 rin chen<\/li> <li>rNam rgyal grags pa<\/li> <li>Nam mkha\u2019 bstan \u2019dzin<\/li> <li>sKyang tshang Bla ma gtsug gshen<\/li> <li>sKyang tshang gYung drung gtsug rgyan<\/li> <li>sKyang sprul Nam mkha\u2019 rgyal mtshan<\/li> <li>bSod nams rgyal mtshan<\/li> <li>bSod nams bstan \u2019dzin and Phun tshogs rnam rgyal<\/li> <li>Nyi ma rgyal mtshan<\/li> <li>gYung drung kun khyab<\/li> <li>Khro bo rgyal mtshan<\/li> <li>Shes rab dbang rgyal<\/li> <\/ol><p>In addition to the above-mentioned lineage, there is another lineage known as mDa\u2019 chen kha ma, \u201cthe Upper mDa\u2019 chen\u201d that originated in the dKar mo Hermitage of the monastery founded by Nam mkha\u2019 bstan \u2019dzin, the fourteenth master.

However, all the masters of both successions had equal roles in the monastery. The assembly hall (\u2019du khang) survived the Cultural Revolution, although not the statues and thangkas within were destroyed.
