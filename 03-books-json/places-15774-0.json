In the 13th Rab yung (1747-1806), at the time of gZa’ ru Khro rgyal, the chief of the gZa’ ru tribe, there was a village called Bon sde stod ma near gTso tshang Monastery (No.91), whose religious gathering place was a temple of A skyid sKyang tshang Monastery (No.194) in Ma ru village of gZa’ ru tribe where a few monks lived, known as Bon sde stod ma. But as the religious practitioners did not live according to monastic vows, it was decided that the monastery should be moved to a more isolated spot. Thus A tshogs tshang of A skyid sKyang tshang Monastery bought the present site of the monastery in exchange for a white cow and other goods. The new monastery was named Nyos zhing, literally “field that was bought”. After the monastery was completed, the monasteries of sKyang tshang, gTso tshang and the local lay community decided that since it was A tshogs tshang who built the monastery, it would remain a branch of sKyang tshang Monastery, but that since it was located nearer gTso tshang, the latter would take charge of the monastery and the chief of the local gZa’ ru tribe would be the monastery’s patron. The agreement was committed to writing and signed by all parties. Thus rGyal ba g-yung drung phun tshogs of sKyang tshang and gYung drung bstan ’dzin of gTso tshang are counted as the first of its patriarchs.</p><ol type=\"1\"> <li>rGyal ba g-yung drung phun tshogs and gYung drung bstan ’dzin</li> <li>gTso bla bSod nams phun tshogs alias A bsod tshang </li> <li>gTso bla bDe chen dbang ’dus </li> <li>gTso bla bSod nams dbang grags </li> <li>gTso dbon bsTan ’dzin dbang rgyal alias A khu bsTan rgyal tshang, also known as gTso dbon rgan </li> <li>gTso dbon Zla ba rgyal mtshan, a nephew of the 5th </li> <li>gTso dGra ’dul mgon po (1932-1971) was recognized as the rebirth of A khu bsTan rgyal tshang by gTso dbon Zla ba rgyal mtshan.

Although the sKyang ’phags lineage in mDa’ chen Monastery has survived to this day, the Sources concerning its history are no longer available, and the dates of many of the masters remain unknown. Following is a list of the masters of mDa’ chen ’og ma, “the Lower mDa’ chen” lineage who looked after the monastery: </p><ol type=\"1\"> <li>sKyang ’phags Nam mkha’ g-yung drung</li> <li>Rang grol Bla ma rgyal mtshan</li> <li>Gling zhig Shes rab g-yung drung</li> <li>Gling zhig rGyal ba bstan ’dzin</li> <li>Gling zhig rNam rgyal grags pa</li> <li>Tshul khrims rgyal mtshan</li> <li>Rin chen rgyal mtshan</li> <li>Nam mkha’ ye shes</li> <li>bSod nams ye shes</li> <li>gYung drung phun tshogs</li> <li>Shes rab ’od zer</li> <li>Nam mkha’ rin chen</li> <li>rNam rgyal grags pa</li> <li>Nam mkha’ bstan ’dzin</li> <li>sKyang tshang Bla ma gtsug gshen</li> <li>sKyang tshang gYung drung gtsug rgyan</li> <li>sKyang sprul Nam mkha’ rgyal mtshan</li> <li>bSod nams rgyal mtshan</li> <li>bSod nams bstan ’dzin and Phun tshogs rnam rgyal</li> <li>Nyi ma rgyal mtshan</li> <li>gYung drung kun khyab</li> <li>Khro bo rgyal mtshan</li> <li>Shes rab dbang rgyal</li> </ol><p>In addition to the above-mentioned lineage, there is another lineage known as mDa’ chen kha ma, “the Upper mDa’ chen” that originated in the dKar mo Hermitage of the monastery founded by Nam mkha’ bstan ’dzin, the fourteenth master. The succesion of this lineage is as follows:</p><ol type=\"1\"> <li>Nam mkha’bstan ’dzin, the fourteenth </li> <li>sKyang sprul Nam mkha’ rgyal mtshan, the seventeenth </li> <li>Rin chen rgyal mtshan </li> <li>Nam mkha’ rgyal po </li> <li>A drung </li> <li>Tshul khrims bstan ’dzin </li> <li>bsTan ’dzin dbang rgyal and Lung rtogs skal bzang rgya mtsho (DzNGL pp.227-229) </li> </ol><p>The mDa’ chen ’og ma is regarded as more important than mDa’ chen kha ma, because its lineage is the original lineage of the monastery, whereas mDa’ chen kha ma is an offshoot of the latter. However, all the masters of both successions had equal roles in the monastery. The assembly hall (’du khang) survived the Cultural Revolution, although not the statues and thangkas within were destroyed. The monastery was officially reopened and its reconstruction undertaken in 1982.</p>",
