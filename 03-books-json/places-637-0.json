Its importance dates back to its status as the capital of the Tibetan Empire in the seventh and eighth centuries, and as the capital of the Dalai Lama's government from the seventeenth century onwards. In China it serves as the capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region.</p> <p><span class=\"place\" title=\"F637\">Lhasa</span> has also been perhaps the most important religious site over the history of Tibet. It is home to the <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15474\">Jokhang</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"F15474\">jo khang</span></em>) temple complex, founded by the seventh century Tibetan Emperor <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Songtsen Gampo</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">srong btsan sgam po</span></em>) and residence of the most famous religious image in Tibet - the <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Jowo</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">jo bo</span></em>) statue of the Buddha Shakyamuni. The <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15474\">Jokhang</span> is the nucleus of central <span class=\"place\" title=\"F637\">Lhasa</span>'s commercial and religious <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15467\">Barkor</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"F15467\">bar skor</span></em>) area.

The valley in which <span class=\"place\" title=\"F637\">Lhasa</span> is situated is formed by the river <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kyichu</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">skyid chu</span></em>), a tributary of the <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Tsangpo</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">gtsang po</span></em>,Â known as the Brahmaputra in India).
