The seven all-stone residences found here were built on a sandy slope and on the bench above it, both of which rise above the <span class=\"popular\">Chulung Gongma</span><span class=\"scholar\">Chu lung gong ma</span> valley (4390 m). These structures were widely spaced apart, affording the inhabitants a good deal of privacy. These well-built edifices were constructed from mostly unhewn blocks of granite. The random-rubble texture walls were mud mortared (although most of it has disappeared with ime). The <span class=\"popular emph\">do khang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rdo khang</span> were designed and built using the standard features of this monument typology. Like the neighboring fortress, these structures must have been where he archaic cultural priestly class and/or ruling elite of the area once resided. It would seem that the commoners who worked the nearby fields lived in temporary shelters. Extensive cultivation once took place at <span class=\"popular\">Chulung Gongma</span><span class=\"scholar\">Chu lung gong ma</span>, supported by a stream coming from a side valley. This valley no longer produces a perennial source of water and all arable lands have been abandoned. </p>",

Several corbels are still in place in the rear tier of rooms, the longest of which (1.1 m) rests on a partition wall.

The two walls partitioning the rear tier into 3 rooms extend 1 m from the rear wall. In front or to the east of this buttressing are the entrances to the north and south rear rooms (adjacent to the entrance between the two tiers of rooms). These rear tier room entrances measure 90 cm x 60 cm and 1 m x 60 cm. The forward tier of the structure has been reduced to fragmentary footings. Its entrance also appears to have been in the east (a gap 50 cm wide in the wall exists here). The forward wall of the east tier has a maximum external height of 1.6 m, 70 cm of which is below the floor level. There is a hole on the south side of the forward wall that may be the remains of a latrine pit. </p>",

The rear tier of the structure, measuring 7 m (north-south) x 4 m (east-west), contains two relatively large rooms. The rear north room (3 m x 2.7 m) has a forward wall that is fully intact (stands 1.6 m). The rear wall of the north room is also well preserved. It was built 1.5 m into the ground, giving the <span class=\"popular emph\">do khang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rdo khang</span> a semi-subterranean aspect.

Its partly integral forward wall is 1.4 m high while its rear wall was built 1.4 m into the uphill slope. Near the top of the south wall (at ground level) of the rear south room there is a niche. There is also a rectangular niche (45 cm x 30 cm x 50 cm) in the rear wall of this room. The forward tier (9 m x 4.4 m) of rooms in RS6 has been razed, thus its floor plan is no longer evident. The forward wall of the forward tier, while not coherent, reaches 1.2 m in height, all of which is below the floor level of the structure.
