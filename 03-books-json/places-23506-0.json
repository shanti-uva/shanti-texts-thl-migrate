During Khri srong lde btshan&rsquo;s\n                        time, Dran pa nam mkha&rsquo; lived in Reb gong and built a large monastery at A\n                        ba ngos bzang. During the time of King U dum btsan, because of the\n                        persecution of Bon, the three <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">grub thob</span>, (&ldquo;perfected\n                        beings&rdquo;)--all three brothers of the Khyung lineage-- fled from Central Tibet\n                        to Reb gong. They first stopped to rest at Chad lung thang, a short distance\n                        from the present site of Bon brgya Monastery. Later the three brothers\n                        established their residences in three villages in Reb gong &ndash;&rsquo;Khor lo bsgyur\n                        rgyal in sPyi sting village, Ye shes mtsho rgyal in Ngo mo village, and\n                        Khyung dkar tshang ba in Khyung bo village-- and began to propagate Bon in\n                        the region. Their descendents and spiritual heirs are still living in Reb\n                        gong (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">Bon brgya&rsquo;i gsung</span>, p.5). Around the same time, a\n                        Bonpo called dByings klong rin chen from sTong che in Khri ka arrived in Reb\n                        gong and married sTag ga&rsquo;i rGyal mo byams. Their descendents became the Bon\n                        brgya village that established itself in Bon brgya village in the valley of\n                        the same name. Several members of the village founded a hermitage at the\n                        site of the present monastery and formed the first religious community of\n                        Bon brgya Monastery. Other members eventually became nomads. Originally Bon\n                        brgya village comprised only twenty families but at present there are more\n                        than seven hundred families, including the nomad families (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">Bon brgya&rsquo;i gsung</span>, p.6) which altogether constitute the local lay\n                        community of the monastery. Although the monastery has a long history and is\n                        renowned for its many remarkable tantric practitioners and monks, its\n                        development as a monastic institution is fairly recent and probably does not\n                        go far back beyond the time of Bon brgya gYung drung phun tshogs who lived\n                        at the beginning of the twentieth century and who built the Don gnyis lhun\n                        grub lha khang with statues of the Three Buddhas of the Three Ages, rNam par\n                        rgyal ba, the Thousand Buddhas and a stupa (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">mchod rten</span>)\n                        dedicated to rNam par rgyal ba outside. Just as the statues and the stupa\n                        were being completed, Shar rdza bKra shis rgyal mtshan sent a letter to the\n                        monastery along with two hundred types of sacred objects (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">rten</span>) with which to fill the statues and then visited the monastery\n                        in person. This event created a sensation among the local community and\n                        marked the history of the monastery. Bon brgya gYung drung phun tshogs not\n                        only became a student of Khri rgan &rsquo;Jam dbyangs thub bstan rgya mtsho who\n                        was the teacher of the sixth Shang tshang (the religious and political head\n                        of Reb gong at the time) but also became close to the sixth Shang tshang\n                        himself. As a result, Bon brgya Monastery enjoyed a period of prosperity and\n                        development. Later, however, the monastery was damaged twice by the army of\n                        Ma Bufang, the warlord of Qinghai (Ma Bufang tongzhi Qinghai sishi nian). In\n                        1944, sKyang sprul Lung rtogs skal bzang rgya mtsho, a great master of mDzod\n                        dge, remained at the monastery for a year during which he visited many\n                        monasteries and <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">gsas khang</span> temples in the Kokonor area,\n                        giving teachings not only to the monks at the monastery but to all the Bonpo\n                        communities throughout the whole of Reb gong. Most monasteries and <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">gsas khang</span> in the Kokonor area payed hommage to him.\n                        During his visit to Reb gong in 1980, the tenth Panchen Lama proposed to\n                        rebuild Bon brgya Monastery and offered the monastery a statue of Amitabha\n                        together with one thousand and eight hundred Chinese Yuan for its\n                        reconstruction. Official permission was granted by the local government the\n                        following year; the first buildings to be reconstructed were the Don gnyis\n                        lhun grub lha khang and the residence of Bon brgya Trulku. In recent years,\n                        Bon brgya Trulku established a philosophical school (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">bshad\n                           grwa</span>) and a meditation school (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">sgrub grwa</span>)\n                        where the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">lo gsum</span> (three-year retreat) is practised.\n                        The main assembly hall is large and has twelve columns.</p>\n\n                  \n\n                  \n\n                     "},{"title":"4.
