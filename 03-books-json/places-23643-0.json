The monastery is a resettlement of the same name in Kham, Tibet which was a private religious establishment of the king of Gling in Derge, and the Bonpo lama Hum chen ’gro ’dul gling pa, the Sixth Kun grol, was the prelate of this king. Because of these relations in Tibet the head of the Gling tshang settlement in Dehradun wished that the monastery be built near the settlement. sMan ri Monastery in Dolanji appointed rTogs ldan brTson ’grus rgyal mtshan as the abbot of the monastery and in 1996 he was succeeded by dGe bshes Nyi ma grags pa.
