It is named for the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpopular Tibetan <span class=\"popular\">Tenma</span><span class=\"scholar\">Brten ma</span> goddess. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsummit rises 120 m above the old agricultural settlement (much of this arable land now lies fallow). The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trelatively large amount of farmland the <span class=\"popular\">Dechok</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bde mchog</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlocale must have at least in part provided the economic impetus for the construction of the castle. The facility\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thas a fairly good defensive posture due to the steep slopes that surround it. The stronghold forms a contiguous\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcomplex of tight-knit buildings, with an axis 65 m in length (oriented northeast-southwest). The complex has a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmaximum width of 38 m. There must have been at least 80 rooms/buildings at <span class=\"popular\">Khargok Dorj&eacute; Yudr&ouml;nma</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mkhar gog rdo rje g.yu sgron ma</span> in total. Narrow, open\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpassageways appear to have connected the various structures. Undoubtedly this site was founded when the local\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpopulation was significantly larger than at present. All buildings are highly degraded although many wall segments\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\treach a height of 50 cm to 1 m. No roofing materials are in situ. All structures were built of light-colored\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tunhewn granite blocks, generally 20 to 50 cm in length. The mud-mortared walls (40 cm to 60 cm thick) have a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trandom-rubble texture. Archaic morphological features of the site include the diminutive size of the buildings and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tother structural features indicative of all-stone corbelled edifices such as upslope walls deeply inset into the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tground. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Some Tibetans of the region variously attribute rdo rje g.yu sgron ma\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmkhar to the <span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span> or <span class=\"popular\">Singpa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sing pa</span>.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Site elements","index":6,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"North rim structures","index":7,"parent_index":6,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The north rim of the summit is lined with a continuous band of small rooms/buildings.

The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdimensions of these interior spaces are such that they could have accommodated all-stone corbelled roofs (but\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlittle evidence for this feature remains). The lining of the edge of a summit with edifices, but no ramparts or\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcurtain-walls, is also encountered upstream at &lsquo;<span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span>&rsquo; sites such as mkhar lung mkkar gog (A-66). The inner or uphill walls of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe northern rim structures are built as much as 1.5 m into the ground. Most of the north rim structures sit\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tupon low elevation revetments, but one building surmounts a revetment 2 m in height. Approximately 4 m to 5 m\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbelow the north side of the summit, a level area was cut along the slope. This transverse walkway is 5 m to 7 m\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twide and continues around to the east face of the hillside. No such circumvallation is found on the south side\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the formation. There was possibly a section on the southwest flanks of the hill but most of it has slid away.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMore complete circumvallations are found at western Tibetan sites like <span class=\"popular\">Gya Nyima Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rgya nyi ma mkhar</span> (A-53) and <span class=\"popular\">Drak Puk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Brag phug</span> (A-35).

In one such structure, depressed 1.1 m, there are the roots of a buttress forming a divide\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbetween two small rooms with rounded corners. Two granite members 1 m in length (likely functioned as roof\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tappurtenances) were found among the rubble of this structure.

Nevertheless, there appear to have\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\talso been larger buildings with regular ground plans that are likely to have had wooden roofs at the site. One\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsuch structure has interior dimensions of 6 m x 6 m (located near the upper east end of the summit). Likewise\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe structures along the south rim of the summit appear to have been larger and taller than those on the north\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand east rims. There are larger structures towards the center of the rdo rje g.yu sgron ma\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmkhar complex as well. One of these central buildings had a floor space measuring 10 m x 2.5 m to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3 m. At the southwest corner of the summit there is a small remnant of what may have been an earthen wall. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\teast side of the summit extends well beyond the zone of ruins. A gully 2 m deep was cut to demarcate the complex\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom the undeveloped eastern portion of the summit.
