The main reason I call them dialects is that they traditionally share Classical Tibetan as their literary language. The expression &ldquo;Tibetan dialects&rdquo; to denote closely related languages that share a common literary language is analogous to the traditional terms of &ldquo;Arabic dialects&rdquo; or &ldquo;Chinese dialects.&rdquo; See <a href=\"../1808/children/1809#dialectschina\">Ritual Kmap: Activities</a></p>\n"},{"title":"Dialects","index":2,"parent_index":0,"body":"\n<p class=\"Paragraph\">Below is a list of the main dialects and their location within each country.</p>\n"},{"title":"Dialects in China","index":3,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">དབུས་སྐད་</span> in Lhasa  Prefecture, Tibetan Autonomous Region</li>\n<li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">གཙང་སྐད་ </span>in Zhikats&eacute;  Prefecture, T.A.R.</li>\n<li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ཀོང་པོའི་སྐད་ </span>in Nyingtri  Prefecture, T.A.R.</li>\n<li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">སྟོད་སྐད་</span> in Ngari  Prefecture, T.A.R.</li>\n<li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ལྷོ་ཁའི་སྐད་ </span>in Lhokha  Prefecture, T.A.R.</li>\n<li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ཧོར་སྐད་</span> in Nakchu Prefecture, T.A.R.</li>\n<li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ཁམས་སྐད་</span> Kham dialects are spoken in Chamdo prefecture (T.A.R.), Kandz&eacute; T.A.P.

(Note that this is a tentative classification. For some dialects such as Sherpa or Mustangi, further research is needed to establish their affiliation.)</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The &Uuml;-Tsang group: &Uuml;, Lhokha, Kongpo, Tsang, T&ouml;.</li>\n<li>The T&ouml; subgroup of &Uuml;-Tsang includes dialects from Ngari and Zhikats&eacute; prefectures in the T.A.R. as well as various dialects spoken in northwestern Nepal (Limi, Mugu, Dolpo, Mustangi, and Nubri) and northeastern Nepal (Lhomi, Dhrogpai Gola, and Walungchung Gola).</li>\n<li>The Kham-Hor group: Central Kham (Deg&eacute; and Chamdo area), Southern Kham (Dechen area), Northern Kham (Y&uuml;shu, Nangchen area), Northeastern Kham (Tewo, Choni), and Hor (Nakchu area).</li>\n<li>The Amdo group: North Kokonor Amdo (Kangtsa, Chilen, etc.), West Kokonor Amdo (Dulan, Nagormo, etc.), Southeast Kokonor Amdo (Chentsa, Trika, Hualong, etc.), Southern Gansu Amdo (Labrang, Luchu, etc.), Golok Amdo (Machen, Mat&ouml;, Gabde, etc.), Ngapa Amdo (Ngapa, Dzorg&eacute;, Dzamtang, etc.) and Kandz&eacute; area Amdo spoken by some nomad tribes.</li>\n<li>The Dzongkha-Sikkimese group: Dzongkha, Lakha, Chochangacha, Sikkimese, Merak Sakteng Drokpa, Dur Drokpa.</li>\n<li>The Ladakhi-Balti group: Ladakhi, Balti, Purik.</li>\n<li>The Lahul-Spiti group: Lahul, Spiti, Nyamskat.</li>\n<li>The Sherpa-Jirel group: Solu Sherpa, Khumbu Sherpa, Jirel (all spoken in northeastern Nepal).</li>\n<li>The Kyirong-Kagate group: Kyirong (spoken in Kyirong county, T.A.R.), and Kagate, Tsum, Langtang, and Yolmo (sometimes called Helambu Sherpa), all spoken in northeastern Nepal.<a name=\"n2\" href=\"#fn2\">[2]</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"Paragraph\">Mutual comprehension is generally good between the dialects of the &Uuml;-Tsang group and Standard Tibetan. On the other hand, with the dialects of the other groups, communication is severely limited if their speakers know absolutely no standard or Literary Tibetan. Of these the furthest removed from central Tibetan are the dialects of Ladakh, Baltistan, and Amdo, which did not develop tones.</p>\n<p class=\"Paragraph\">Nomad-pastoralists, from whichever region (Ngari, Nakchu, Kham, etc.), have a particular speech referred to as <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">འབྲོག་སྐད་</span>, as distinct from the speech of sedentary agriculturalists, which is described as <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">རོང་སྐད་</span>. The word <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">རོང་པ་</span> refers to farming communities in the low-lying valleys, as opposed to the nomads. Tibetans in Nepal use the term to denote the ethnic groups of the middle hills.(Drokk&eacute;, Rongk&eacute;, rongpa)</p>\n<p class=\"Paragraph\">Amongst the populations bordering Tibet, many people speak Tibetan. Two examples are the populations of Gyarong <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">རྒྱལ་རོང་ </span>and Minyak <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">མི་ཉག་</span> in Sichuan. The inhabitants of both Gyarong and Minyak consider themselves Tibetans and they usually speak Tibetan. However, in neither case is the native language a Tibetan dialect, although Tibetan is used by both as the literary language.</p>\n<p>It should be noted finally that within the Tibetan-speaking world, most educated people in the cities speak at least one or even two languages apart from their native Tibetan language: Chinese, Hindi-Urdu, Nepali, or English depending on the country where they live.</p>\n<hr size=\"1\" />\n<p><a name=\"fn1\" href=\"#n1\">[1]</a> For more details, see George Van Driem, <em>Dzongkha</em>, written with the collaboration of Karma Tshering of Gaselo (Leiden: Research CNWS, School of Asian, African, and Amerindian Studies: 1998).</p>\n<p><a name=\"fn2\" href=\"#n2\">[2]</a> I am grateful to Roland Bielmeier who provided valuable information on dialects of Nepal and Pakistan, personal communication, February 2003.</p>"}]}
