His youngest son, gYung drung dbang ldan, founded the original lCang lung Monastery at a place in gTer lhung valley where he discovered a chest containing a bse ru’i ra, “rhinoceros horn”, and that, as a result, became known as bSe ru’i mgo. </p><p>Following is a list of the monastery’s masters: </p><ol type=\"1\"> <li>gYung drung dbang ldan </li> <li>gYung drung lhun grub</li> <li>gYung drung bstan rgyal </li> <li>Nam mkha’ lhun grub, </li> <li>Blo gros g-yung drung </li> <li>bsTan pa dbang rgyal </li> <li>Kun bzang rgyal mtshan </li> <li>mKhas grub rgyal mtshan </li> <li>Rin chen dbang ldan </li> <li>gYung drung dbang rgyal </li> <li>Nam mkha’ bzang po </li> <li>bSod nams dbang rgyal </li> <li>bSod nams bzang po </li> <li>lHun grub tshul khrims </li> <li>mChog dga’ </li> <li>Yon tan rin chen </li> <li>Rin chen </li> <li>bSod nams g-yung drung </li> <li>Kun bzang rgyal mtshan </li> <li>gYung drung rnam rgyal </li> <li>rNam ’joms </li> <li>gYung drung lha mo </li> <li>Ya ma rgyal </li> <li>bsTan ’dzin </li> <li>mKhas btsun Bon dbyings rdo rje </li> <li>Tshe dbang g-yung drung </li> <li>Rab brtan shes rab </li> <li>bsTan ’dzin dbang rgyal </li> <li>Rang lta rin chen </li> <li>Kun bzang rdo rje </li> </ol><p>This list is taken from a history of the monastery entitled lCang lung dgon, MS, unfortunately no dates are given.
