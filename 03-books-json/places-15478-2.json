According to <em><span class=\"tibtext\" title=\"Type ID here\">Tianzhu Zangchuan Fojiao Siyuan Gaikuang <\/span><\/em>(2000), the present-day <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15478\">Tianzhu<\/span>, which was historically called <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15478\">Liangzhou<\/span>(<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Times Ext roman;\"><span lang=\"zh-CN\">\u51c9\u5dde<\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family: Times Ext roman;\">) in Chinese, became a Tibetan-populated area after Tibetans occupied it for over a hundred years from 764 to 864. This was the period when Buddhism and B\u00f6n began to take root in this area. <\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family: Times Ext roman;\">In 838, King Lang Darma (<em>glang dar ma<\/em><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">)<\/span><em> <\/em>started his campaign to destroy Buddhism and promote B\u00f6n. After learning about this, Rapsel (<em>rab gsal<\/em><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">)<\/span>, Gechung (<em>dge 'byung<\/em>), and Mar Shakyamuni (<em>dmar shAkya mu ni<\/em>), who are known as Three Scholars, fled <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15355\">\u00dc<\/span>-tsang (<em>dbus gtsang<\/em><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">)<\/span><em> <\/em>with Buddhist scriptures and items, and arrived in <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15348\">Amdo <\/span>(<em>a mdo)<\/em>. In order to promote Buddhism, they traveled around <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15348\">Amdo <\/span>and at a point came to the <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15478\">Tianzhu <\/span>area. Rapsel died at age 84 in 1035 near <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\"><span style=\"background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%;\">Maierzangzha<\/span> <\/span>(in <span class=\"place\" title=\"F1158\"><span style=\"background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%;\">Huzhu<\/span><\/span>), where Gechung and Mar Shakyamuni meditated previously. His followers built a stupa, which later became <span style=\"background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%;\"><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Baima Monastery<\/span><\/span>, one of the earliest monasteries in <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15478\">Pari<\/span>. <\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family: Times Ext roman;\">The Minyak \/ Xixia (<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Times Ext roman;\"><span lang=\"zh-CN\">\u897f\u590f<\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family: Times Ext roman;\">) kingdom took over this area for over two hundred years and advocated for the spread of Buddhism more strongly than ever before. In 1159, Renxiao di (<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Times Ext roman;\"><span lang=\"zh-CN\">\u4efb\u5b5d\u5e1d<\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family: Times Ext roman;\">) invited the founder of Kagy\u00fc (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">bka' brgyud<\/span><\/em><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">)<\/span>, Dusum Khyenpa (<em>dus gsum mkhyen pa<\/em><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">)<\/span>, to preach in this area. His disciple, Gesh\u00e9 Tsang Zangpo (<em>dge bshes gtsang bzang bo<\/em><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">)<\/span>, came and provided teachings, translated Buddhist texts, and built many temples. <\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family: Times Ext roman;\">In 1226, Mongols invaded <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15478\">Liangzhou <\/span>and in 1238 Ogedei Khan\u2019s son, G\u00f6den, was stationed here and sent an army to Tibet. However, thinking that military occupation was not the best way to control Tibet, G\u00f6den invited famous Sakya Kunga Gyeltsen (<em>sa skya kun dga' rgyal mtshan<\/em><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">)<\/span> to <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15478\">Liangzhou <\/span>for a peace talk. In 1245, Sakya Kunga Gyeltsen sent his nephew, Pakpa (<em>'phags pa<\/em><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">,<\/span><em> <\/em><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">Baisiba)<\/span>, and Chakna Dorj\u00e9 (<em>phyag na rdo rje<\/em><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">)<\/span><em> <\/em>to <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15478\">Liangzhou<\/span>. A year later, in 1246, he himself reached <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15478\">Liangzhou <\/span>after consulting with the authorities and leaders of other sects. In the next five years, he gave teachings to different ethnic groups, and built temples such as <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Baita Si<\/span> <span style=\"background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%;\">(Shatr<\/span><span style=\"background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%;\">\u00fcl Ped\u00e9, <\/span><em><span style=\"background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%;\">shar sprul pa'i sde<\/span><\/em><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"><span style=\"background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%;\">)<\/span><\/span>, <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Jingta Si<\/span> (Lhowang D\u00e9, <em>lho dbang sde<\/em><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">)<\/span>, <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Xi Lianghua Si<\/span> (Nup Pemod\u00e9, <em>nub pad mo sde<\/em><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">)<\/span>, and <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Bei Haizang Si<\/span> (Janggya Tsod\u00e9, <em>byang rgya mtsho sde<\/em><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">)<\/span>. As a result the Sakya (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">sa skya<\/span><\/em><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">) sect<\/span> became influential in this area. In 1251, he passed away at <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Baita Si<\/span><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"><span style=\"background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%;\"> <\/span><\/span>in <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15478\">Liangzhou<\/span>. Even though Pakpa continued to live in <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15478\">Liangzhou<\/span>, later he met Qubilai and became the teacher of the head of Yuan Dynasty. Pakpa and Chakna Dorj\u00e9 continuously served in <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Baita Si<\/span> along with Darmapala (Chakna Dorj\u00e9, <em>phyag na rdo rje<\/em>), Gongga Luozhui, Nanka Jianzan, Gonga Lebei Qiongnei and others. During this period, almost all the monasteries in this area belonged to Sakya sect. Also, during this period, Kagy\u00fc lamas began their missionary activities in <span class=\"place\" title=\"F431\">Qinghai<\/span>, <span class=\"place\" title=\"F432\">Gansu <\/span>and <span class=\"place\" title=\"F5243\">Mongolia<\/span>. <\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family: Times Ext roman;\">In 1256, Karma Pakshi (<em>kar ma pa k+shi<\/em><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">, Boxi<\/span>) received the black hat, the symbol of his sect, from the Yuan Xuanzong (<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Times Ext roman;\"><span lang=\"zh-CN\">\u5143\u5baa\u5b97<\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family: Times Ext roman;\">) emperor. Beginning with Karma Pakshi, the Tibetan reincarnation system became institutionalized. Many Kagy\u00fc lamas were quite active in <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15478\">Liangzhou<\/span>. <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Tiantang Si<\/span> (Ch\u00f6rten Tang, <em>mchod rten thang<\/em><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">)<\/span><em> <\/em>was originally a Kagy\u00fc monastery, and many monasteries in this area belonged to Kagy\u00fc sect. <\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family: Times Ext roman;\">In 1372, the Ming dynasty destroyed the Yuan forces in the area and took power. As a way to maintain some sort of control over Tibetan regions, the Ming started giving the lamas titles such as Dugang (<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Times Ext roman;\"><span lang=\"zh-CN\">\u90fd\u7eb2<\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family: Times Ext roman;\">), Da Lama (<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Times Ext roman;\"><span lang=\"zh-CN\">\u8fbe\u5587\u561b<\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family: Times Ext roman;\">), and Hutuketu (<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Times Ext roman;\"><span lang=\"zh-CN\">\u547c\u56fe\u514b\u56fe<\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family: Times Ext roman;\">). In the early Ming, a famous Kagy\u00fc lama named Samlo Lama ([<em>bsam lo bla ma<\/em><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">]<\/span><em> <\/em>d. 1414), also known as Hai Lama, received the title Dugang. He left <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15355\">\u00dc<\/span>-tsang and went to <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kokonor Lake<\/span> to meditate on the island and later settled down with his relatives in Drotsang (<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Times Ext roman;\"><span lang=\"zh-CN\">\u4e50\u90fd<\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family: Times Ext roman;\">). He then went nearby <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Guanlong Monastery<\/span> (G\u00f6nlung, <em>dgon lung<\/em>) and meditated there. Afterwards, he went to <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15478\">Liangzhou <\/span>and became the mentor at <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Shanglung Monastery<\/span>. During the Ming, Yunjia Fo (<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Times Ext roman;\"><span lang=\"zh-CN\">\u960e\u5bb6\u4f5b<\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family: Times Ext roman;\">) received the Dugang title, and during the Qing Tongkor Lama and Dalong Lama received the Hutuketu title. <\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family: Times Ext roman;\">In 1407, Tsongkhapa (<em>tsong kha pa<\/em><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">)<\/span> established the Geluk (<span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\"><em>dge lugs<\/em><\/span><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">) sect<\/span> and it spread rapidly throughout <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15348\">Amdo<\/span>. By the end of the Ming Dynasty, all the monasteries in <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15478\">Pari <\/span>were converted to Geluk. During the Qing Dynasty, the Geluk rose to prominence. The 5<sup>th<\/sup> Dalai Lama stopped in <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15348\">Pari <\/span>on the way to the Qing court and performed religious rituals here. In 1779, the 6<sup>th<\/sup> Panchen Lama <em>(pan chen bla ma<\/em><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">)<\/span><em> <\/em><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">also<\/span> stopped in the area on the way to the Qing court and was received warmly by the local lamas and authorities. The presence of Geluk sect was firmly consolidated. The 6<sup>th<\/sup> Dalai Lama spent many years here when he was in exile. In fact, he served as abbot at <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Yarlung Turchen<\/span> (<em>yar klungs tur chen<\/em><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">,<\/span><em> <\/em>Shimen Si), which he restored. Moreover, he served as the abbot (<em>mkhan po<\/em><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">)<\/span> for 13 monasteries in <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15348\">Pari<\/span>. In 1723, Lojang Tenzin (<em>blo bzang bstan 'dzin<\/em><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">, Tibetan<\/span> spelling uncertain), the Mongol khan in Qinghai, rebelled against the Qing. Since some monasteries in <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15348\">Pari <\/span>took part in the rebellion, the monasteries such as <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Yarlung Turchen<\/span> and <span class=\"place\" title=\"F23049\">Semnyi <\/span>(<em>sems nyid dgon<\/em><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">, Xianming<\/span> Si) in this area were ruined and burned by the Qing army. <\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family: Times Ext roman;\">In 1866, the Muslim leader Ma Zhan\u2019ao, who led a rebellion against the Qing, came to <span class=\"place\" title=\"F17823\">Hexi <\/span>(<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Times Ext roman;\"><span lang=\"zh-CN\">\u6cb3\u897f<\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family: Times Ext roman;\">). The Qing court ordered the monks in <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15348\">Pari <\/span>to fight the Muslims. As a consequence, the Muslims took over <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15348\">Pari <\/span>and all the monasteries were destroyed.
