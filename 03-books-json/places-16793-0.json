The east-facing slopes are generally grassy and have a moderate slope gradient. The small terraced funerary structures (20 m² to 60 m²) of the site appear to have sub-rectangular and ovoid forms, while the large specimens (60 m² to 120 m²) are rectangular. These structures are built in the same fashion as other examples of the typology (II.2e) in the far eastern <span class=\"popular\">Jangtang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Byang thang</span>. The forward/downhill sides of the structures are prominently elevated above the slope, while rear walls are generally flush with the slope. The two long walls of these flat-topped structures are oriented perpendicular to the axis of the slope. Stones without any discernable pattern or arrangement line the forward flank and sides of each structure. In some specimens there are also clearly delineated rear walls. Most, if not all of the terraced structures of<span class=\"popular\">Migön Chönyi</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mi mgon chos nyid</span>, are free from structural elements situated inside he outer walls. Variable-length (20 cm to 60 cm long) grayish volcanic (?) rocks were used in construction. </p>

The south sector structures are primarily arrayed in a single row situated at the same elevation. The structures of the north sector are aggregated into several groups at varying elevations. Most of the larger structures are found in the north sector. The forward flanks of the large specimens are elevated as much as 1.5 m above the downhill slope, while the forward flanks of the smaller specimens are elevated up to a height of 1 m. The rear walls are flush with the uphill slope or slightly elevated above it in certain specimens. The largest specimen at <span class=\"popular\">Migön Chönyi</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mi mgon chos nyid</span> (13 m x 9.2 m) has a slight depression in the middle of its top. Perhaps this represents traces of an old excavation.
