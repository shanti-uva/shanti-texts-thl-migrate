The east-facing slopes are generally grassy and have a moderate slope gradient. The small terraced funerary structures (20 m\u00b2 to 60 m\u00b2) of the site appear to have sub-rectangular and ovoid forms, while the large specimens (60 m\u00b2 to 120 m\u00b2) are rectangular.

The forward\/downhill sides of the structures are prominently elevated above the slope, while rear walls are generally flush with the slope. The two long walls of these flat-topped structures are oriented perpendicular to the axis of the slope.

The south sector structures are primarily arrayed in a single row situated at the same elevation. The structures of the north sector are aggregated into several groups at varying elevations. Most of the larger structures are found in the north sector. The forward flanks of the large specimens are elevated as much as 1.5 m above the downhill slope, while the forward flanks of the smaller specimens are elevated up to a height of 1 m.
