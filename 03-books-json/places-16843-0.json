Bounding the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tplain in the east is a bluish outcrop, gyam sngon po.

The structure was constructed on level terrain somewhat offset from the cardinal directions (4.7 m x\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t4.4 m). It now consists of single-course perimeter walls, but there is faint evidence to suggest that originally\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthey may have been partially or fully double course. Dark blue metamorphic stones and white igneous rocks were\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tused to construct the walls (up to 50 cm in thickness with a maximum projection of stones 20 cm above ground). The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinterior is devoid of structural elements, but, at some point in the past, stones were removed from the outer\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twalls and piled up inside the enclosure. This stone pile was made long enough back to be quite heavily eroded.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>According to local sources, <span class=\"popular\">Gyamng&ouml;npo M&ouml;ndur</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gyam sngon po mon dur</span> is an ancient <span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span> burial\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstructure.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n"}]}
