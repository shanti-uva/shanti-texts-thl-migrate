The remains of three cubic tombs are found on a relatively level stretch of ground, which is hemmed in by three large crags. These tombs are perched 230 m above the <span class=\"popular\">Kongchen</span><span class=\"scholar\">Kong chen</span> valley and occupy elevated rocky ground. From the site there are long views in all directions except in the north, the direction of the <span class=\"popular\">Yidtsé Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Yid rtse mkhar</span> summit (5030 m). The terrain is sandy and thickly covered in rocks. The cubic tombs are constructed of a blue-gray grained metamorphic (?) rock of variable length (up to 60 cm long), which has weathered to a reddish color. Some of the stones of the central chambers have orange climax lichen growing on them. Although the tombs are in poor condition, they do not appear to have been disturbed for a long time. </p> <p>As with virtually all the cubic tombs sites, those of <span class=\"popular\">Yidtsé Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Yid rtse mkhar</span> were probably desecrated when Buddhism became the banner of the dominant political forces of the region. This destruction of tombs was probably part of the process of subjugation and the severing of the old sociopolitical links of which they were apart. The mountaintop cubic tombs, by virtue of their prominent and lofty positions, were conspicuous symbols of the archaic cultural order. </p> "},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":" <p>According to local <span class=\"popular emph\">drok pa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">’brog pa</span>, <span class=\"popular\">Yidtsé Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Yid rtse mkhar</span> is an ancient <span class=\"popular\">Mön</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span> monument. </p> "},{"title":"Site elements","index":6,"parent_index":2,"body":" <p>The outer shells of the three cubic tombs have largely disintegrated.
