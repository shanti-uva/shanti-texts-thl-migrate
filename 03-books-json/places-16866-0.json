The remains of three cubic tombs are found on a relatively level stretch of ground,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhich is hemmed in by three large crags. These tombs are perched 230 m above the <span class=\"popular\">Kongchen</span><span class=\"scholar\">Kong chen</span> valley and occupy elevated rocky ground.

The terrain is sandy and thickly covered in rocks.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe cubic tombs are constructed of a blue-gray grained metamorphic (?) rock of variable length (up to 60 cm long),\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhich has weathered to a reddish color.

This destruction of tombs was probably part of the process of subjugation\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand the severing of the old sociopolitical links of which they were apart.
