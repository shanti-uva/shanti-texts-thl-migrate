   "body": "<p class=\"Paragraph\">“Self-corrective” auxiliaries (or copulas) imply that the speaker has just realized that he was mistaken or that he was hitherto unaware of what he is asserting.</p>
<p class=\"Paragraph\">The main self-correctives are <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ཡིན་པ་རེད་</span>, <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ཡོད་པ་རེད་</span>, and <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ཡོད་པ་ཡིན་པ་རེད་</span>. Statements using these auxiliaries often begin with <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ཨ་ལའི་</span> “Well, well! Oh, I see!”</p>
<p class=\"Paragraph\">As in the case of other mediatory auxiliaries and copulas, a distinction may be made between “essential” and “existential.”</p>
