On the south and east sides of the ridge there are sheer 60-m drops to the \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tspu gling chu. There are three sectors of aggregated residential ruins: south, central \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand north. The uniform design and construction traits show that this was probably an integrated site in terms of \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcultural orientation and chronology. Puling<span class=\"popular\">&nbsp;Y&uuml;ltong</span><span class=\"scholar\">Spu gling yul stong</span> appears to have been a much more developed and populous village than its present-day \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcounterpart. Several corrals have been constructed near the ruins, but the extraction of stones for their \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconstruction has had a minimal impact on the site due to its large mass.</p>\n"},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n<p>According to an older resident of <span class=\"popular\">Puling</span><span class=\"scholar\">Spu gling</span> named \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"popular\">Samdrup</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bsam grub</span>,&nbsp;Puling<span class=\"popular\">&nbsp;Y&uuml;ltong</span><span class=\"scholar\">Spu gling yul stong</span> was an ancient <span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span> village.

Ground plans are now highly \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tambiguous. In fact, much of the site consists merely of piles of rubble. Rear walls were often set deeply into \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe slope giving the edifices a semi-subterranean aspect. Walls (around 60 cm thick) have a random-rubble \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttexture and contain variable-length stones (generally 15 cm to 60 cm long), which were hewn flat on their \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\texterior sides. A gray and tan rock (resembling sandstone) was used in construction. The remains are highly \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tweathered and most of the clay-based mortar has washed out of the seams. The type of wall construction shows \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat most or all of the buildings of <span class=\"popular\">Puling Y&uuml;ltong</span><span class=\"scholar\">Spu gling yul stong</span> were built with wooden roofs.</p>\n"},{"title":"South sector","index":8,"parent_index":7,"body":"\n<p>The south sector is spread over the crest and east flank of the ridge. It measures 30 m (east-west) x 35 m \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(north-south). The south sector consists of a dense collection of interconnected residences built at three or \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfour levels. On the east slope below the main cluster of structures there are one or two ruined small \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbuildings. Rear walls were customarily built into the uphill slope to a depth of 1.6 m. In several places, \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trear walls have rounded corners. Revetments shoring up the structures are up to 1.5 m in height. On the south \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tflank of the hill, about one-half the distance to the spu gling chu, there appears to \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbe a minor archaeological dispersion but only a few wall fragments are extant.</p>\n"},{"title":"Central sector","index":9,"parent_index":7,"body":"\n<p>The central sector is situated 12 m north of the south sector. Measuring 15 m (east-west) x 14 m \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(north-south), it extends across the edge of the crest of the sandy ridge and along its east flank. The \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcentral sector contained approximately 15 interconnected rooms/buildings built at various elevations along a \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsteep slope gradient. At the northeast corner of the dispersion there is a free-standing wall segment 1.8 m in \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\theight. Other walls 1 m to 1.5 m in height have also persisted, but generally the remains are highly \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfragmentary. Rear walls are built into the slope to a depth of 1.3 m. On the southwest side of the central \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsector there is a niche (40 cm x 40 cm x 35 cm) in a wall at ground level. On the crest of the ridge adjacent \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto the west side of the central sector there is possibly a small extension of the site, but too little remains \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ton the surface to make a positive determination.</p>\n"},{"title":"North sector","index":10,"parent_index":7,"body":"\n<p>The north sector is found within a few meters of the central sector and measures 23 m (east-west) x 20 m \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(north-south). A substantial portion of the north sector extends to the west flank of the ridge, as well as \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcovering the summit and a little of the east slope. This was another conterminous zone of residences. An \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\textension of the west slope structures continues all the way to the ceremonial structure (see below). This \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\textension covers an area of 7 m (east-west) x 11.5 m (north-south). The remains located in the west slope \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\textension are set into the slope to a depth of 2 m. North of the north sector, along the rim of the east \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tslope, there are traces of substantial revetments (up to 1.5 m high). These probably mark another building \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsite.</p>\n"},{"title":"Shrine complex","index":11,"parent_index":7,"body":"\n<p>On the summit of Puling<span class=\"popular\">&nbsp;Y&uuml;ltong</span><span class=\"scholar\">Spu gling yul stong</span>, between the south and central sectors, there is the ceremonial component of the site. It \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconsists of a square masonry plinth, measuring 4.8 m on each side, which is aligned in the cardinal \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdirections. This plinth extends 50 cm out of the ground on its north side and 80 cm on its east side. The \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsouth and west side of the plinth are flush with the ground surface. This setting appears to be an original \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdesign feature because there is no visible evidence of geomorphologic modification to the local terrain. Upon \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe plinth there is a superstructure (up to 2 m high) that appears to have consisted of a large cubic element \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsurmounted by a smaller, possibly spherical erection. In the top of the structure there is a cavity (75 cm x \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t75 cm) that is now only a few centimeters deep. A wall interconnected to the west side of this ceremonial \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstructure runs along the summit in a westerly direction for upwards of 10 m. The south edge of this \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trandom-work wall is flush with the surface, while its north side is elevated around 50 cm above the surface. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe semi-subterranean aspect of this shrine complex seems to endow it with an archaic cultural identity. It \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmay possibly have been used in the worship of chthonic deities.</p>\n<hr class=\"footnote-divider\" />\n"},{"title":"Notes","index":12,"parent_index":0,"body":"\n<div class=\"footnote\"><a name=\"n88\"></a> <a class=\"note\" href=\"#nb88\"> [88] </a> The pre-modern village of P<span class=\"popular\">uling</span><span class=\"scholar\">Spu gling</span> and \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tits Communist period successor were founded on the same level stretch of ground.
