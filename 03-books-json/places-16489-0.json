The largest summit structure has been reduced to a lump of earth capping an adobe\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfoundation/revetment. The use of earthen walls in this structure must be a response to the relative scarcity of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstones at the site and the presence of ample deposits of clay. In the vicinity, on higher pinnacles, small bits of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmasonry are found. To the south are two major groups of caves, many with the remains of masonry fa&ccedil;ades built\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\taround them.
