This building carcass has a maximum height of 2.5 m (east side). South and east of this structure, on or near the ridge-top, here are the faint traces of many other structures. From the main earthen structure, a ridge-line stretches in a southerly direction for 100 m. No structural remains are visible on this summit but they may well have been obliterated by erosion and the failure of the soft slopes. Beyond this area, the main ridgeline turns in an easterly direction and gains in elevation. All along this 150 m long, 3 m to 7 m wide summit, there are the fragmentary remains of revetments (standing walls have disappeared). It appears that a fairly dense agglomeration of small buildings once stood here. The earthen formation is subject to heavy erosion and it is probable that many walls slipped down the very steep slopes over time. <\/p> "},{"title":"Northwest cave complex","index":8,"parent_index":6,"body":null},{"title":"Southeast cave complex","index":9,"parent_index":6,"body":null},{"title":"Affiliated sites","index":10,"parent_index":2,"body":" <p>There are several Buddhist archaeological sites in the vicinity of Blue Castle.<\/p> "},{"title":"mChod rten","index":11,"parent_index":10,"body":" <p>A number of Buddhist ruins are found on the south flanks of the hillside below Blue Castle.
