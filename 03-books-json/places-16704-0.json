   "body": "<p>The isolated pillar of <span class=\"popular\">Horduk Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Hor dug rdo ring</span> is located on the north side of the great salt lake <span class=\"popular\">Ngangla Ringtso</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ngang la ring mtsho</span>. Views to the north and east are constrained by a mountain that rises above the lake basin. On the other hand, the vistas south and west are wide open. The terrain is moderately sloping and sandy. The unshaped tabular pillar is 1 m in height and has a basal girth of 1.1 m. The broad sides of this light-colored granite specimen face north and south, as do most tabular pillars in Upper Tibet. <span class=\"popular\">Horduk Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Hor dug rdo ring</span> is firmly anchored in the substrate and is strongly weathered. Its function is enigmatic. There are no funerary structural traces in the vicinity and no obvious boundary lands. </p><p>The archaic cultural sites documented on the shores of <span class=\"popular\">Ngangla Ringtso</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ngang la ring mtsho</span> (see A-96, B-131, C-114, D-70, and D-129) tend to be less extensive than those that arose at the neighboring lakes of <span class=\"popular\">Daroktso</span><span class=\"scholar\">Da rog mtsho</span> and <span class=\"popular\">Trari Namtso</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bkra ri gnam mtsho</span>. The high elevation and the extreme salinity of its waters are likely to be factors in the retardation of sedentary settlement along the margins of <span class=\"popular\">Ngangla Ringtso</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ngang la ring mtsho</span>. The particularly harsh and barren terrain of the lakeshore must have also discouraged permanent habitation. </p>",
