In contrast, brgyud points to a lineage, which stresses the transmission of a body of knowledge or practices from a teacher to a student over successive generations. At the broadest level, Tibetan religious groups are typically classified into three overarching rubrics: the ancients (Nyingma, rnying ma), the new ones or \u201cmodernists\u201d (Sarma, gsar ma), and the B\u00f6n (bon). The basic split concerns above all the founders of each tradition, with each pointing to different time periods, different figures and different cultures as involved in the inception and transmission of their most distinctive traditions. The Nyingma claim roots going to back to the Tibetan imperial period in the eighth and ninth century, whereas the Sarma groups all originate in the late tenth century onwards from new lineages imported from India; the B\u00f6n are distinctive in that they claim to have originated in very ancient times in a special transmission from regions to the West of Tibet to a kingdom known as Zhangzhung (zhang zhung) located in what is now West Tibet. In addition, the Sarma groups are typically divided into four main groups, though this in fact does not accurately represent their tremendous internal diversity:<\/p><ol> <li>Sakya (sa skya)<\/li> <li>Kagy\u00fc (bka' brgyud)<\/li> <li>Geluk (dge lugs)<\/li> <li>Kadam (bka' gdams)<\/li> <\/ol><p>Sectarian traditions can thus be named based upon temporal issues, such as \u201cthe old ones\u201d vs. the \u201cnew ones.\u201d Most typically, they are named after places of origination, which may also coincide with the names of the major monasteries and founders as they also are place based: \u201cSakya,\u201d \u201cJonang,\u201d \u201cTselpa,\u201d and so forth. To a lesser extent, sects are named after generic appellations, such as the \u201cInstructional Precepts\u201d (Kadam), \u201cPrecept Transmissions\u201d (Kagy\u00fc), or \u201cVirtuous\u201d (Geluk). While sectarian affiliation certainly has a clear reality in many contexts, it is also true that there is a considerable amount of arbitrariness and fluidity in terms of what actually constitutes a sect (chos lugs). This is especially true when consider sub-sects, since at some point it is quite arbitrary whether a given affiliation is considered an independent sect, or simply a movement. For the present purposes we define a \u201csect\u201d as a religious movement with the following characteristics:<\/p><ul> <li>A clearly identified founder<\/li> <li>A distinctive body of literature specific to it<\/li> <li>Statements of identity separate from other religious movements<\/li> <li>Centers with permanent buildings<\/li> <li>A shared administrative hierarchy<\/li> <li> Common ritual activities such as pilgrimages and festival events<\/li> <\/ul><p>We have applied these criteria even if a resultant \u201csect\u201d may only have a single monastery affiliated with it. At the same time, it must be noted that the larger sects are characterized by big \u201cmother\u201d monasteries (ma dgon) which have many affiliated \u201cbranch\u201d monasteries (yan lag dgon) associated with it, have founders, characterize literature and even textbook systems, and possess large complexes of buildings. Some of the most famous and systematic of these are of course the famous \u201cthree seat\u201d (gdan sa gsum) monasteries of the Geluk tradition based in the surrounding area of Lhasa: Drepung ('bras spungs), Ganden (dga' ldan) and Sera (se ra). These three monastic organizations had huge resources at their disposal, large numbers of affiliated organizations, and highly distinct senses of their own separate identity. Indeed several other sectarian traditions do name themselves after the base monastery, such as the Sakya and Jonang. However, ultimately, these monasteries\u2019 inhabitants clearly view and portray themselves as belonging to a broader sectarian affiliation, namely the Geluk, we have not classified them as sects. While somewhat paradoxical by scale \u2013 organizations with huge resources are not \u201csects,\u201d while single monasteries with limited resources can constitute a \u201csect\u201d \u2013 we believe this best accords with the traditional Tibetan perception of sects.
