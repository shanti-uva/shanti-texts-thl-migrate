The name is said to\n                        be derived from a temple with the same name that was located in Tibet, in\n                        similar environmental surroundings. The year in which the temple was built\n                        is not known, but may be obtained on the basis of an examination of the Tre\n                        ston lineage history (work on which is now proceeding). The area is said to\n                        have been popular among hunters, who would drive animals into this rocky\n                        corner, from which there is no escape. Tre ston Tshe dbang tshul khrims\n                        chose this site in order to suppress hunting and to promulgate the Bon\n                        religion. </p>\n\n                     <p>Most recent bla mas in Ringmo, in chronological order, are: </p>\n\n                     <ol type=\"1\">\n                        <li>mTha&rsquo; bzhi gDul ba rig &rsquo;dzin</li>\n\n                        <li>Tre ston bSod nams g-yung drung</li>\n\n                        <li>mTha&rsquo; bzhi rGyal ba gtsug phud</li>\n                     </ol>\n\n                     <p>The biography of mTha&rsquo; bzhi gDul ba rig &rsquo;dzin used to be kept in Ringmo, but\n                        it is now in Kathmandu. </p>\n\n                     <p>Tre ston bSod nams g-yung drung used to have many disciples.

After becoming ill, however, he meditated on\n                        Khyung dmar for three years, in the course of which he acquired a great deal\n                        of spiritual power.
