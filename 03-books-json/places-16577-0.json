Bon tradition maintains that heir ancient practitioners used this site. A 14.5-m long outer retaining wall was built up around <span class=\"popular\">A Puk</span><span class=\"scholar\">A phug</span>, forming a 3-m- to 6-m wide level area in front of he cave. This area was used by inmates to sun themselves and for household chores, etc. The mud plastered masonry façade around <span class=\"popular\">A Puk</span><span class=\"scholar\">A phug</span> is now in a state of disrepair. There is no indication of when these walls were constructed, but we might expect that they have been modified over the centuries. The cave consists of two outer chambers with a total length of 7 m. One of these chambers was used for cooking and one for sleeping. An inner chamber (2 m x 2.8 m) has a large white letter <span class=\"popular emph\">a</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">a</span> on the ceiling that is said to have been self-formed. This inner chamber, the chapel of the cave, contains a large bay with three shelves that were used for religious articles, as well as a niche in he wall. Also in the inner chamber, low walls surround the place for meditation. These were designed to prevent practitioners from sprawling out. </p>",
