Bon tradition maintains that heir ancient practitioners used this site. A 14.5-m long outer retaining wall was built up around <span class=\"popular\">A Puk<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">A phug<\/span>, forming a 3-m- to 6-m wide level area in front of he cave.

There is no indication of when these walls were constructed, but we might expect that they have been modified over the centuries. The cave consists of two outer chambers with a total length of 7 m. One of these chambers was used for cooking and one for sleeping. An inner chamber (2 m x 2.8 m) has a large white letter <span class=\"popular emph\">a<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">a<\/span> on the ceiling that is said to have been self-formed. This inner chamber, the chapel of the cave, contains a large bay with three shelves that were used for religious articles, as well as a niche in he wall. Also in the inner chamber, low walls surround the place for meditation. These were designed to prevent practitioners from sprawling out. <\/p>"},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":"<p>Tibetan Buddhists commonly believe that <span class=\"popular\">A Puk<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">A phug<\/span> was used by the great saint <span class=\"popular\">Milarepa<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Mi la ras pa<\/span> (1040-1123) for meditation. <\/p>"},{"title":"Textual tradition","index":6,"parent_index":2,"body":"<p>According to <span class=\"popular emph\">Gang Tis\u00e9 Logy\u00fc<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">Gangs ti se\u2019i lo rgyus<\/span> by he late <span class=\"popular\">Gang Riwa Ch\u00f6ying Dorj\u00e9<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Gangs ri ba chos dbyings rdo rje<\/span>, it was <span class=\"popular\">Jets\u00fcn Milarepa<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Rje btsun mi la ras pa<\/span> who magically scrawled the letter <span class=\"popular emph\">a<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">a<\/span> with his finger.<a href=\"#n70\" name=\"nb70\" class=\"note\">70<\/a> The Bonpo, however, claim <span class=\"popular\">A Puk<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">A phug<\/span> as their own.
