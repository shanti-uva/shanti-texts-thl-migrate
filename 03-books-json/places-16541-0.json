The site appears to have had a functional relationship with the defunct agricultural lands located below in the <span class=\"popular\">Chulung Gongma</span><span class=\"scholar\">Chu lung gong ma</span> valley. There is also a ruined settlement of seven ancient <span class=\"popular emph\">do khang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rdo khang</span> spread out across sandy slopes and benches approximately 300 m to the north (B-45). We might surmise that the political and/or religious elite of this agricultural enclave inhabited the <span class=\"popular\">Dongmar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gdong dmar</span> fortress. The hard to reach stronghold is built in reddish crags that rise 90 m above he valley floor. This siting must have provided the facility with a secure military position. Flanked by sheer rock faces, potential attackers would have faced a formidable challenge from the defenders. The dry-mortar, random-rubble block-work contains stones that are generally 20 cm to 60 cm in length. </p>",
