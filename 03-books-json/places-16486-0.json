   "body": "<p>The castle of Big Sun Castle is located on a flat summit, which rises approximately 150 m out of the expansive <span class=\"popular\">Gya Nyima</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rgya nyi ma</span> basin. The site enjoys views in all directions and a panoramic sweep of the Uttarakhand Himalaya. A dry-mortar random-rubble parapet was constructed around the entire rim of the summit, which measures 160 m (east-west) x 32 m (north-south). A number of ruined buildings are located within this wall, the most prominent of which is an earthen and stone structure on the east end of the summit. Both adobe block and rammed-earth were used in the construction of Big Sun Castle. At this juncture, none of the rammed-earth wall structures found at <span class=\"popular\">Gugé</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ge</span> sites such as <span class=\"popular\">Gya Nyima</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rgya nyi ma</span> can be confidently attributed to the archaic cultural horizon. It is also worth noting that rammed-earth constructions are very seldom encountered at <span class=\"popular\">Jangtang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Byang thang</span> residential centers attributed by local sources to the prehistoric epoch. It seems likely that at least some of the remains at Big Sun Castle represent a Lamaist era facility. </p>",

When it was completed the king was pleased, however, and offered the head builder a large sum of gold. People encouraged the king not to inhabit Big Sun Castle, as it was of substandard construction. It was believed that its geographic aspect is inauspicious because to the east there is a mountain in the form of a wailing man, to the north there is a wild yak butting in the direction of the fortress mountain, to the south a howling wolf mountain, and to the west the blackened lid of an upset cauldron (<span class=\"popular emph\">langnga</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">slang nga</span>) mountain. Residents of <span class=\"popular\">Khyunglung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Khyung lung</span> township also tell a similar tale set in the historic epoch. It is also said that Big Sun Castle had a military rivalry with the castle of Mistress Mountain Castle (<span class=\"popular\">Jomo Rirang Khar</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">jo mo ri rang mkhar</span>) (A-54), located 10 km to the north. </p>",

On the east end of the summit there are the remains of a heavily built edifice (7.5 m x 7.5 m). It was constructed of white stones, red adobe blocks with a high stone matrix and rammed-earth, representing all three major wall types found in the <span class=\"popular\">Gugé</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ge</span> region. The east wall of rammed-earth still attains 3.2 m in height. On he highest part of the summit, 8 m away, there is a stone building foundation that measures 18. 6 m (east-west) x 12 m (north-south). At a distance of 16 m from this foundation there is an adobe block structure (8 m x 9 m), which is nearly leveled. </p><p>Much of the central portion of the summit is devoid of structures. On the western extremity of the summit there are the ruins of a building (7 m x 9.5 m) built on a 1 m-tall stone revetment, upon which rammed-earth walls stand a maximum of 1.7 m in height. Above the rammed-earth walls there are courses of adobe blocks totaling up o 70 cm in height. These adobe blocks are 80 cm in length. The original height of this building must have been in excess of 4 m. There is a circumvallating terrace approximately 10 m in width situated 5 m to 7 m below the summit. This manmade feature was probably built with a defensive function in mind.

This extraordinary site is in direct view of sacred Mount <span class=\"popular\">Tisé</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ti se</span>, located 90 km to the northeast. <span class=\"popular\">Yama</span><span class=\"scholar\">G.ya' ma mchod rten</span> is situated on the border of <span class=\"popular\">Purang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Spu rang</span> and <span class=\"popular\">Tsada</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rtsa mda'</span> counties, at the northern foot of the Himalayan passes of <span class=\"popular\">Shau La</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sha'u la</span> and <span class=\"popular\">Kode La</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ko sde la</span> (sp.?), in the <span class=\"popular\">Chukar Tsango</span><span class=\"scholar\">Chu dkar gtsang po</span> headwaters. <span class=\"popular\">Yama</span><span class=\"scholar\">G.ya' ma mchod rten</span> consists of more than 200 red sandstone a type of shrine, which local sources say were built by the <span class=\"popular\">Rongpa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rong pa</span> <span class=\"popular emph\">tra</span><span class=\"scholar emph\"> tra</span>ders of Darchula (members of he so-called Bhotia tribes) over a period of several centuries. These shrines are 1 m to 3.5 m in height, each of which consists of three to five tiers (<span class=\"popular emph\">pangrim</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">pang rim</span>). They were constructed in a rudimentary manner; no attempt was made to sheath or paint the stones. The a type of shrine are scattered on a steep mountainside and on a ridgeline below. The a type of shrine found on the ridgeline were grouped ogether by low-lying interconnecting walls. On some of the monuments rest plaques inscribed with the <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma ṇi</span> mantra. It is reported that the a type of shrine were erected by those who lost a family member in the preceding year. It has not been determined if they had a reliquary function. </p><p>Also at <span class=\"popular\">Yama</span><span class=\"scholar\">G.ya' ma mchod rten</span> there are around 20 rock shelters with circular plans (2.5 m to 4.9 m across). They were built and used by Bhotia traders as <span class=\"popular\">A Tak</span><span class=\"scholar\">A stag</span>ing post for their Transhimalayan journeys. These shelters have high, beehive-shaped roofs made of large overlapping sandstone slabs (constructed in a much more rudimentary manner than the all-stone corbelled structures of the archaic cultural horizon). Established over an area of 19 m x 46 m, many of the shelters have small south-facing enclosures, which functioned as simple courtyards. At this encampment several short <span class=\"emph\">devanagari</span> inscriptions were carved into stones. Fortunately, the a type of shrine and rock shelters were not damaged during the Chinese Cultural Revolution; the only threats they face are the extremely harsh weather conditions of the Great Himalayan range. </p><hr class=\"footnote-divider\">",
