The site enjoys views in all directions and a panoramic sweep of the Uttarakhand Himalaya. A dry-mortar random-rubble parapet was constructed around the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tentire rim of the summit, which measures 160 m (east-west) x 32 m (north-south). A number of ruined buildings are\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlocated within this wall, the most prominent of which is an earthen and stone structure on the east end of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsummit.

When it was completed the king was pleased,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thowever, and offered the head builder a large sum of gold. People encouraged the king not to inhabit Big Sun Castle, as it was of substandard construction. It was\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbelieved that its geographic aspect is inauspicious because to the east there is a mountain in the form of a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twailing man, to the north there is a wild yak butting in the direction of the fortress mountain, to the south a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thowling wolf mountain, and to the west the blackened lid of an upset cauldron (<span class=\"popular emph\">langnga</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">slang nga</span>) mountain.
