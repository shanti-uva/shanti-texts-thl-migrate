This summit is surrounded by cliffs and very steep slopes, endowing it with an \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\texcellent defensive aspect. The site enjoys a panoramic view of the <span class=\"popular\">Gya Nyima</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rgya nyi ma</span> basin, situated some 500 m below the site. Unlike the open and centralized \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlocation of Big Sun Castle (A-53),  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"popular\">Jomo Rirang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Jo mo ri rang</span> is situated at the  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thead of an uninhabited and isolated valley. The  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"popular\">Jomo Rirang Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Jo mo ri rang mkhar</span> stronghold consists of three ruined residential complexes: upper, middle and lower. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThese complexes form contiguous bands of structures and cover no less than 2000 m&sup2; in total. The many diminutive \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbuildings are stacked in vertical arrays, which spread out along the steep acclivities of the various summit \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tridges. Some of the edifices in the upper complex were two stories tall. The present day desolation of the locale \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcontrasts with its ostensible demographic status in ancient times, when hundreds of people must have lived and \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tworked here. Corbelled stone roofs and semi-subterranean, small, windowless rooms are prominent design features of \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe site, firmly placing it in the archaic cultural horizon. All edifices were built with long corbels, bridging \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstones and dry-mortar random-rubble walls. Dark gray corbelling and bridging stones, up to 2.3 m in length, are \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tscattered all over the site. The structural evidence indicates that the buildings were finely built, alluding to \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe one time presence of a sophisticated cultural center.</p>\n"},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n<p>Possibly the legendary prehistoric <span class=\"popular\">Zhang Zhung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Zhang zhung</span> association of Big Sun Castle is really \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tintended for jo mo ri rang mkhar.

It is said that the territorial deity (<span class=\"popular emph\">y&uuml;llha</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">yul lha</span>) <span class=\"popular\">Jomo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Jo mo</span> ri rang once manifested as an onager  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(<span class=\"popular emph\">kyang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rkyang</span>) and visited a \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tshepherd&rsquo;s camp near <span class=\"popular\">Denchu</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gdan chu</span> monastery (located on the headwaters of the Sutlej (<span class=\"popular emph\">Langchen Tsangpo</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">glang chen gtsang po</span>)). By circling the tents she slew many livestock. The five families that lived \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthere erected a prayer flag mast in honor of the territorial deity in \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tan attempt to placate her. One of the members of the camp was an avid hunter, and on a hunting foray he spotted a \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tonager with a golden saddle and caparison. When he looked at it a \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsecond time it was merely an ordinary onager so he shot it. To his astonishment, when he arrived at the spot of \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe kill there was an adept (<span class=\"popular emph\">druptop</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">grub thob</span>) there. He quickly looked away but when he returned his gaze there \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twas the slain onager. He skinned the dead animal and brought the pelt back to his camp. Soon thereafter, he died \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfollowed by all the other inhabitants of his camp from one cause or another. For a long time afterwards not even \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlivestock or wild ungulates would graze in the area. <span class=\"popular\">Jomo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Jo mo</span> ri rang is reputed to make the buildings on her inner (south) side \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinvisible to onlookers, while at other times visitors see buildings and livestock roaming about.
