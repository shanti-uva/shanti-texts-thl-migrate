   "body": "<p>The large all-stone citadel of <span class=\"popular\">Jomo Rirang Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Jo mo ri rang mkhar</span> is spread out over the top of a flaming orange-red spur, on the south side Mount <span class=\"popular\">Jomo Rirang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Jo mo ri rang</span>. This summit is surrounded by cliffs and very steep slopes, endowing it with an excellent defensive aspect. The site enjoys a panoramic view of the <span class=\"popular\">Gya Nyima</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rgya nyi ma</span> basin, situated some 500 m below the site. Unlike the open and centralized location of Big Sun Castle (A-53), <span class=\"popular\">Jomo Rirang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Jo mo ri rang</span> is situated at the head of an uninhabited and isolated valley. The <span class=\"popular\">Jomo Rirang Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Jo mo ri rang mkhar</span> stronghold consists of three ruined residential complexes: upper, middle and lower. These complexes form contiguous bands of structures and cover no less than 2000 m² in total. The many diminutive buildings are stacked in vertical arrays, which spread out along the steep acclivities of the various summit ridges. Some of the edifices in the upper complex were two stories tall. The present day desolation of the locale contrasts with its ostensible demographic status in ancient times, when hundreds of people must have lived and worked here. Corbelled stone roofs and semi-subterranean, small, windowless rooms are prominent design features of he site, firmly placing it in the archaic cultural horizon. All edifices were built with long corbels, bridging stones and dry-mortar random-rubble walls. Dark gray corbelling and bridging stones, up to 2.3 m in length, are scattered all over the site. The structural evidence indicates that the buildings were finely built, alluding to he one time presence of a sophisticated cultural center.</p>",

Local <span class=\"popular emph\">drok pa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">’brog pa</span> consider Mount <span class=\"popular\">Jomo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Jo mo</span> ri rang very inauspicious, and the deaths of both people and livestock are commonly attributed to it. It is said that the territorial deity (<span class=\"popular emph\">yüllha</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">yul lha</span>) <span class=\"popular\">Jomo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Jo mo</span> ri rang once manifested as an onager (<span class=\"popular emph\">kyang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rkyang</span>) and visited a shepherd’s camp near <span class=\"popular\">Denchu</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gdan chu</span> monastery (located on the headwaters of the Sutlej (<span class=\"popular emph\">Langchen Tsangpo</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">glang chen gtsang po</span>)). By circling the tents she slew many livestock. The five families that lived here erected a prayer flag mast in honor of the territorial deity in an attempt to placate her. One of the members of the camp was an avid hunter, and on a hunting foray he spotted a onager with a golden saddle and caparison. When he looked at it a second time it was merely an ordinary onager so he shot it. To his astonishment, when he arrived at the spot of he kill there was an adept (<span class=\"popular emph\">druptop</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">grub thob</span>) there. He quickly looked away but when he returned his gaze there was the slain onager. He skinned the dead animal and brought the pelt back to his camp. Soon thereafter, he died followed by all the other inhabitants of his camp from one cause or another. For a long time afterwards not even livestock or wild ungulates would graze in the area. <span class=\"popular\">Jomo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Jo mo</span> ri rang is reputed to make the buildings on her inner (south) side invisible to onlookers, while at other times visitors see buildings and livestock roaming about. A rock outcrop on <span class=\"popular\">Jomo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Jo mo</span> ri rang in the vicinity of the citadel is called Female <em>Srin</em> Spear Carrier (<span class=\"popular\">Sinmo Dunkhyer</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">srin mo mdung ’khyer</span>).</p>",

This narrow ridgeline (32 m x 3 m to 4 m) is densely packed with the walls of crumbling buildings. These structures are staggered in the crags at various elevations. Standing walls are highly fragmentary and most buildings have been reduced to their footings. Isolated wall segments reach 3.2 m in height. Only a single roof beam and one corbel (among many hundreds) seem to have survived in situ. From the summit, a south facing gully (52 m long along the axis of the slope and 14 m wide) spills down the side of the formation. It contains the ruins of a contiguous band of habitational structures. Flanking the gully are stone ribs that hosted continuous lines of analogous structures. These edifices were all small (around 10 m²) and built in the archaic fashion with all-stone corbelled roofs.

Some of these semi-subterranean structures still have a few roof slabs and bridging stones in place. The longest in situ bridging stone is 2.1 m. At the western extremity of the complex there is a single two-story tall structure, which probably contained four lower rooms and four upper rooms. One of the lower rooms still has a substantial portion of its ceiling intact.
