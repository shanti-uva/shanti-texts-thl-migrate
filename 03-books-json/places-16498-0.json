This large citadel is located near the right bank of the <span class=\"popular\">Senge Tsangpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sengge gtsang po</span> (Indus River), below its confluence with the <span class=\"popular\">Gar Tsangpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sgar gtsang po</span>. The valley is very broad here and supports excellent pasturelands.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe buildings of the fortress begin just above the valley floor and continue upwards along a rocky limestone\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thillside for 50 m. Unlike most archaic strongholds, the facility does not possess a particularly secure\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgeographic aspect. The site is divided by a gully into north and south sectors, and the ruins have a total\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdispersion of approximately 4000 m&sup2;. Contiguous residential complexes are found in the two sectors. Defensive\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twalls are largely absent from the site, as are buildings with a sharply staggered placement along the axis of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe slope. The buildings were mostly constructed of coursed-rubble that was heavily mortared with red mud. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmud leaching from the walls has tinted the stones a distinctive red color. In some places mud plaster still\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tclings to the walls.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Primarily small pieces of blue-gray limestone (20 cm to 40 cm in length) were used for construction. Design\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttraits demonstrate that all buildings supported roofs made with timbers, although none of these roofs have\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsurvived. A few walls of the facility exhibit diagonal courses of masonry interspersed between horizontal\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcourses. This style of stonework is most commonly found in archaic temple-tombs appended to quadrate arrays of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpillars. However, the standard of stonework at <span class=\"popular\">Rala Kharmar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ra la mkhar dmar</span> is generally inferior to that encountered at the archaic temple-tombs. Buildings of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcastle tend to have high elevations, with many wall sections 3 m to 5 m in height still standing. These\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstructures contained relatively large rooms (commonly 15 m&sup2; to 25 m&sup2;). A few small window openings are found in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcertain buildings. The vestiges of <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma &#7751;i</span> walls are located\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbelow the site in the valley bottom.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n"}]}
