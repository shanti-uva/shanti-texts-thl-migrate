This feature has a circumference of 120 m and a maximum height of 10 m. It is not clear whether this mound represents a natural landform with anthropogenic modifications or is entirely the remains of a manmade structure. The earthen walls found inside the mound are so degraded that they are virtually indistinguishable from the surrounding earth. On the east side of the formation, small rounds of wood are regularly spaced between some earthen slabs. Bone fragments are found inside the mound.</p>",

It is said to have been abandoned because the site was inauspicious and <span class=\"popular\">Rala Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ra la mkhar</span> built in its place. Local lore says that it was surrounded by inauspicious signs embodied by the encircling mountains. To the south, the mountain was like the gaping jaws of a wolf ready to devour livestock. To the west, the mountain was dark, like the darkness created by placing a lid on a vessel. To the north, the mountain was like a butting yak whose horns were menacingly pointed in the direction of the fortress. To the east, the mountain was like a combative man ready to strike. <span class=\"popular\">Pemoche</span><span class=\"scholar\">Spe mo che</span> also seems to be associated with the <span class=\"popular\">Mön</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span>, that nebulous ethnic group thought to have inhabited much of Upper Tibet in early times. </p>",

This large citadel is located near the right bank of the <span class=\"popular\">Senge Tsangpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sengge gtsang po</span> (Indus River), below its confluence with the <span class=\"popular\">Gar Tsangpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sgar gtsang po</span>. The valley is very broad here and supports excellent pasturelands. The buildings of the fortress begin just above the valley floor and continue upwards along a rocky limestone hillside for 50 m. Unlike most archaic strongholds, the facility does not possess a particularly secure geographic aspect. The site is divided by a gully into north and south sectors, and the ruins have a total dispersion of approximately 4000 m². Contiguous residential complexes are found in the two sectors. Defensive walls are largely absent from the site, as are buildings with a sharply staggered placement along the axis of he slope. The buildings were mostly constructed of coursed-rubble that was heavily mortared with red mud. The mud leaching from the walls has tinted the stones a distinctive red color. In some places mud plaster still clings to the walls.</p><p>Primarily small pieces of blue-gray limestone (20 cm to 40 cm in length) were used for construction. Design raits demonstrate that all buildings supported roofs made with timbers, although none of these roofs have survived. A few walls of the facility exhibit diagonal courses of masonry interspersed between horizontal courses. This style of stonework is most commonly found in archaic temple-tombs appended to quadrate arrays of pillars. However, the standard of stonework at <span class=\"popular\">Rala Kharmar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ra la mkhar dmar</span> is generally inferior to that encountered at the archaic temple-tombs. Buildings of the castle tend to have high elevations, with many wall sections 3 m to 5 m in height still standing. These structures contained relatively large rooms (commonly 15 m² to 25 m²). A few small window openings are found in certain buildings. The vestiges of <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma ṇi</span> walls are located below the site in the valley bottom.</p>",
