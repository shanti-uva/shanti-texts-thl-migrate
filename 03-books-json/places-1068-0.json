There ’Dul ba rgyal mtshan established a family considered sacred (gdung brgyud) with the name of lCags mdud situated to the east of the river and below the village of A gling. The family temple which he built became his main residence and was called sNang zhig lCags mdud dgon (NKhGL p.99). Later the temple was extended into a small monastery. The family was famous for its possession of an old silver image of the Bonpo sage Dran pa nam mkha’ known as lCags mdud dngul sku, “the Silver image of the lCags mdud family”. gYung drung rgyal mtshan, the brother of ’Dul ba rgyal mtshan, died at the age of twenty-four leaving two sons: gYung drung bstan pa’i rgyal mtshan and bSam ’grub. While the elder brother looked after the monastery and the younger brother ensured the lineage’s continuity.</p> <p>Shar khog is an area where Bon religion has always been the dominant tradition and where the gdung brgyud system has been the most prevalent. However, in the recent times there were interruptions in the line of the family and the monastery has made great effforts to reestablish the hereditary succession.</p> <p>In 1938, with the help of the local people, lCags mdud Nyi ma bstan ’dzin (1898-1953) moved the monastery to sNa steng and so it became known as sNa steng Monastery. Later lCags mdud sKal bzang rgyal mtshan (1922-1978) took charge of the monastery. The monastery was destroyed during the Cultural Revolution and the present head of the monastery is lCags mdud Zla ba rgyal mtshan (b.1951). He took the initiative to rebuild it in the 1980s. gYung drung nyi ma (b.1973) acts as teacher in the new monastery.</p> "},{"title":"4.

After thirteen years of study, the latter sent him back to Amdo. When he arrived in Shar khog, gTso tshang dbon po and his fifteen disciples came to meet him and became his disciples. Later he was offered land by the local people and founded a hermitage at the site called Rin spungs. Later he extended it into monastery. Towards the end of his life, a thirteen-year old boy called dGe ’dun shes rab (b.1811) from dMu dge came to Rin spungs following a vision he had received in dream. gYung drung bstan rgyal was very enthusiastic about the new visitor and exhorted his disciples to accept dGe ’dun shes rab as his reincarnation after his death. He asked dGe ’dun shes rab to return to the monastery in seven years. He is said to have even made an inventory of all his personal belongings in the presence of dGe ’dun shes rab, and ordered the monks to give them to dGe ’dun shes rab upon his return. However, dGe ’dun shes rab did not return seven years later as agreed so gYung drung bstan rgyas, before his death, left a testament for him in a small wooden box which he hid in the wall of his meditation cell. Finally, the monastery sent some monks to dMu dge to talk with dGe ’dun shes rab’s family who warmly welcomed them and accepted the recognition of their son as the reincarnation of gYung drung bstan rgyal, but the boy was not at home. </p> <p>In the mean time, dGe ’dun shes rab had travelled to rGyal rong, Khyung po, Kong po, lHa sa, rMe’u tshang, Dar ldings, Zhu tshang; he studied at rMan ri for seven years, practiced meditation at Byang gNam mtsho for one year and Khyung po’i sgom grwa for another six years, and had visited many sacred places and monasteries of different traditions (including Buddhism) where he studied and practiced meditation with various great masters and acquired the new name of Shes rab ye shes. Shortly after his return to dMu dge, remembering his promise to gYung drung bstan rgyal, he returned to the monastery. Although the master had died a few years before he was given all gYung drung bstan rgyal’s personal belongings and valuables including the box with the testament. </p> <p>gYung drung bstan rgyal introduced the monastic tradition of sMan ri Monastery and named the monastery Rin spungs bKra shis smin grol gling.

Several decades later, rTogs ldan gYung drung bstan ’dzin (b.1654), a brother of Tshe rgyal, the sKyang tshang chief, returned from sMan ri Monastery (No.1) and asked Tshe rgyal to give him a site called sKyang klu gdong where he founded a small monastery. Later A mkhar, another sKyang tshang chief, asked Bya tshang rTogs ldan bsTan ’dzin rgyal mtshan to be the head of the monastery, and both chief and the master agreed to move the monastery to a new site. The new monastery was called gSer khang rin chen, but it was burned down in a fight. </p> <p>rTogs ldan Phun tshogs ’od zer founded a new monastery called Khri skyong la kha’i dgon Kun khyab bde chen gling for sKyang tshang village. Then sKyang sprul Nam mkha’ rgyal mtshan was invited to be the head of the monastery in the Earth-Rat Year of the 14th Rab byung (1828). The next head in the succession was Rin chen Tshul khrims. Since there was no Sources of water in the vicinity of the monastery, lHun grub rgyal mtshan moved it to rNyi ’bur valley where it became known as rNyi ’bur Monastery. A sngags rGyal mtshan, also known as rTogs ldan bsTan pa tshul khrims (1907-1932), was appointed as the head of the monastery after having served as the dbu mdzad in rNyi ’bur Monastery. He moved the monastery to the present site in 1916. He was succeeded by sKyang dbon bsTan pa’i rgyal mtshan (1911-1955).</p> <p>In 1950, the monastery appointed Hor btsun bsTan ’dzin blo gros rgya mtsho (1889-1975) as the chief teacher (bon slob) and under his guidance, metaphysic studies (mtshan nyid) were introduced. However, the monastey was razed to the ground during the Cultural Revolution and was rebuilt again in the 1980s.</p> "},{"title":"4.
