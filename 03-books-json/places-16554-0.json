Its plan is not\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twell aligned in the cardinal directions. What remains of the superstructure of this powerful installation rests\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tupon heavily built 2-m to 3-m high revetments, most of which are still intact.

What is clear is that there are no commodious rooms such as ceremonial halls or large common spaces\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin the castle (these are characteristic features of large Buddhist edifices). It may be\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the decentralized plan of the installation (like many other early monuments in Upper Tibet) reflects strong tribal features in the social makeup of the ancient upper class.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn other words, domestic decentralization may possibly allude to leaders who ruled in a consensual fashion or\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin close consultation with their people. While the apartments may possibly have housed unrelated groups of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tministers or other personnel, the chieftain or king possibly resided in sequestered quarters found within the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcomplex. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Grand entrance","index":9,"parent_index":7,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The large entrance to the citadel is in the east.

The walls flanking the entrance are\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tspaced 2 m apart. There must have been steps leading 3 m up from the foot of the revetment to the floor of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinterior but none have survived. Below the entrance, a 5-m wide path turns south.

The installation is full of standing wall fragments permitting a general\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tassessment of its ground plan. East of the south entrance wall there is a group of perhaps three rooms set off\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom the rest of the complex. On the south side of the east-west axial corridor there are seven apartments,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\teach consisting of a pair of rooms. To the north of the corridor there are six more such apartments. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpartition walls dividing the two rooms of each suite run parallel to the axis of the facility. These\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tapartments vary somewhat in size; typical interior dimensions being 8 m x 3.5 m. Each suite had a walled off\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tarea (less than 2 m x 2 m) with an opening onto the medial corridor. These openings were built at the floor\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlevel and measure around 50 cm x 50 cm. Some of the apertures still have in situ stone lintels, 60 cm to 70 cm\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin length. The ground plan and design of these apartments recalls a similar feature in the nearby <span class=\"popular\">Drakkar Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Brag dkar mkhar</span> installation (A-120). As\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdiscussed above, the function of these masonry pigeonholes in each apartment is not clear. Perhaps they were\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpart of a sophisticated heating system. If they were indeed latrine pits, does the fact that they open\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinternally and not outwards in the direction of the old village point to a citadel closely allied to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvillagers that lived below? In other words, the architectonic evidence may suggest the existence of a strong\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttribal framework. Identifying these enclosures as latrine pits presupposes a careful system of waste\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmanagement. Instead of sullying the outer community with waste it would have had to be collected and disposed\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof properly. This prospective domestic scenario seems to reflect a society with a confederated or consensual\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tform of government. West of the 13 apartments there is a section of the complex (10 m x 12 m) raised 2 m\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thigher. This elevated area contained around nine small rooms. Perhaps these rooms represent the apartments of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe controlling individual or family of <span class=\"popular\">Mani Tang Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ma &#7751;i thang mkhar</span>. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Old village","index":11,"parent_index":6,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Beginning 7 m below and just south of the entrance to the citadel there is a terraced belt (40 m x 18 m), which\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\textends around the entire north side of the complex. There are two main terraces hosting contiguous structures\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat appear to be the vestiges of domiciliary foundations. There are, however, few coherent wall sections\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tremaining. The north terraces merge on the west side of the citadel with analogous structures extending farther\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twest along the broad slopes. The west zone of rubble filled pits covers an area of 150 m x 60 m (approximately\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t7000 m&sup2;). There is about a 20 m vertical difference between the higher and lower ends of the west zone of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdispersion. The terraces were cut on a north-facing slope, an unusual aspect for habitation (although the site\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgets good east and west exposure). There are no less than 200 tight-knit autonomous structures on the terracing\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnorth and west of the citadel. In some places small sections of coherent wall-footings are discernable. Even\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhere relatively well preserved, the foundations are usually level with the surface or elevated above it no more\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthan 50 cm. Larger specimens measure around 11 m x 6 m, and the footings indicate that they contained at least\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsix small rooms. Smaller specimens are around 8 m x 4 m in size. These structures were built with the same type\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof stones and block-work as the citadel. It appears that some of the domiciles had walled courtyards on the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdownhill side. Other more irregular structures found on the site may have had livestock and/or agricultural\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfunctions.
