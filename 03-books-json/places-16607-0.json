These ostensible residential remains are\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsituated immediately south of the lake outlet known as <span class=\"popular\">Gangga Chu</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gangga chu</span>. The main concentration of structures covers approximately 400m&sup2;, between a rocky knob\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin the east and a cliff face in the west. Until quite recently, significant walls were found here but they have\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen dismantled and the stones removed to build structures at the burgeoning <span class=\"popular\">J iu</span><span class=\"scholar\">Byi&rsquo;u</span> village. A road passes directly below the site so it was relatively easy\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto haul the stones away by truck. Virtually only one section of an east-west running revetment has survived\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tintact, otherwise the site is blanketed in loose uncut blocks of limestone. The integral revetment is 11 m in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlength and parallels the axis of the bluff and ridge above it. This wall was primarily built of large stones (up\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto 1.1 m in length) set in random courses. On the higher reaches of the bluff, possible wall-footings are found\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tamong old and new cairns. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The local identification of the byi&rsquo;u sing pa&rsquo; mkhar as a stronghold may not be correct.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThere was a hilltop fortress at nearby <span class=\"popular\">J iu</span><span class=\"scholar\">Byi&rsquo;u</span>, a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmuch more strategically sound location (A-82), and this would appear to obviate the military value of the site.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImmediately to the west of the facility there is higher ground from which a devastating attack could have been\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlaunched. Upper Tibetan fortresses of the archaic cultural horizon were never established in such vulnerable\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlocations. It is more plausible that this site was a religious center of some kind. The lack of a localized\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBuddhist identity and the site&rsquo;s attribution to a foreign group potentially allude to an\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tarchaic cultural origin, but morphological evidence is lacking at the site. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Local elders state that <span class=\"popular\">Jiu Singp&eacute; Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Byi&rsquo;u sing pa&rsquo;i mkhar</span> was a castle of the <span class=\"popular\">Singpa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sing pa</span>.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Affiliated sites","index":6,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Funerary cairns","index":7,"parent_index":6,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>There are long, slim, tapering cairns on top of the bluff at <span class=\"popular\">Jiu Singp&eacute; Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Byi&rsquo;u sing pa&rsquo;i mkhar</span>, Local sources refer to these as <span class=\"popular emph\">m&ouml;n do</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mon rdo</span> (stones of the <span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span>), and are said to have been erected by people of Himalayan origin whilst on\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpilgrimage to ma pang g.yu mtsho.
