This large ceremonial building or multifaceted shrine complex can be divided into south, central and north sections. The extant physical evidence is not sufficient to determine if RS2 had a residential component or was solely a group of <span class=\"popular emph\">tenkhar<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rten mkhar<\/span>-like shrines. This uniquely designed installation was constructed of stones mainly 40 cm to 80 cm in length. <\/p> <p>The south section of RS2 consists of two square rooms or cubic shrine structures that measure 3 m (north-south) x 7.2 m (east-west). The south section structures have completely collapsed, making positive identification of their function difficult. The west room or structure is less disintegrated and has standing walls (1.5 m to 1.7 m in height) surrounding a cavity. <\/p> <p>The central section of RS2 was comprised of a row of quadrate rooms or shrines, which measure 4 m (north-south) x 16 m (east-west). Standing wall fragments are between 1 m and 1.7 m. The westerly or upslope structure is the most intact part of the central section, and has a cavity in the middle. <\/p> <p>The north section of RS2 is dominated by a tiered shrine structure that is probably of the <span class=\"popular emph\">tenkhar<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rten mkhar<\/span> class (or alternatively, it was a receptacle for votive clay figurines known as <span class=\"popular emph\">Tsatsa<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">tshwa tshwa<\/span>). This shrine measures 2.8 m x 3 m, and is 1.5 m high on its west or upslope flank and 2.5 m high on its down-slope side. The west side of the base consists of five graduated tiers, each made up of a single course of worked stones. In the upper part of the shrine there are openings on the south, west and north sides. Inside this tiered shrine are highly deteriorated small conical <span class=\"popular emph\">Tsatsa<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">tshwa shwa<\/span>. One older <span class=\"popular emph\">Tsatsa<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">tshwa tshwa<\/span> with the image of a Bon (?) deity was also found. These <span class=\"popular emph\">Tsatsa<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">tshwa shwa<\/span>, like the recent plaque inscribed with the Bon <span class=\"popular emph\">matri<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma tri<\/span> mantra found at RS2, may be later additions to the monument. The heavily built roof of the tiered shrine consists of bridging stones and slab sheathing. Adjacent o this shrine there is another specimen in poorer condition, which measures 3.5 m (north-west) x 2 m (east-west) x a maximum of 1.4 m. On the north side of the RS2 complex there are the square bases of two smaller shrines. Likewise, 2 m south of RS2 there are the bases of two other shrines (each: 2 m x 2 m x 1 m).<\/p> "},{"title":"Residential Structure RS3","index":11,"parent_index":8,"body":" <p>Residential structure RS3 is situated 4.5 m north of RS2.
