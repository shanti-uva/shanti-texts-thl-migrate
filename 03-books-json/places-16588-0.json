It is comprised of a walled compound (16.5 m x 13 m) whose entrance is in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsoutheast. Three steps lead up to the entrance, which opens onto a courtyard. In the rear of the compound there\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tare four interconnected rooms that ostensibly were used as chapels and/or as meditation residences. The entrance\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(1.5 m x 70 cm) to the freestanding northeast room (3 m x 2.5 m x 2 m) is in the west. The design of the walls\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(long, straight and uniform) indicates that the northeast room supported a wooden roof, the only structure at\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe site that appears to have done so. There is a niche and a well-built hearth against the west wall. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttimber roof, relatively large entranceway and the presence of a large window (30 cm x 60 cm) in the east wall of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe northeast room seem to indicate that its establishment or reconstruction postdates other<span class=\"popular\">Dzuntr&uuml;l Puk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdzu &rsquo;phrul phug</span> structures. This modification of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe northeast room must be related to its close proximity to the subterranean chamber of<span class=\"popular\">Dzuntr&uuml;l Puk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdzu &rsquo;phrul phug</span>, the geomantic heart of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsite. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Next to the northeast room, at the very rear of the compound, is the northwest chamber. This appears to have\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen the main sanctum at <span class=\"popular\">Dzuntr&uuml;l Puk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdzu &rsquo;phrul phug</span>. Five steps lead down to this subterranean chamber. Its roof is a naturally occurring boulder\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhose rear side is level with the surface of the ridge-top. In order to build this chamber the soil underneath\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthis boulder had to be removed. The overlying boulder is supported by the masonry walls lining the chamber (4 m\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tx 3.3 m x standing room). There is an altar with a large bay constructed of stone and mud against the rear or\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twest wall. There are three niches in the west wall and one niche in the south wall. Pilgrims have affixed tufts\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof white wool, paper <span class=\"popular emph\">lungta</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rlung rta</span> and old protection cords\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(<span class=\"popular emph\">sungd&uuml;</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">srung mdud</span>) to the ceiling, as well as dabbing butter\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ton it. There is a prayer flag mast on the roof of the rear of the chamber, supported by a 1-m high parapet wall.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThere are also a couple of large cairns in the vicinity.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The central room of the <span class=\"popular\">Dzuntr&uuml;l Puk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdzu &rsquo;phrul phug</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcompound is in very poor condition. Its forward wall is up to 1.3 m in height and its rear wall 2.3 m high. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trear wall of the central room forms part of the rear wall of the compound. The south room (2.2 m x 1.6 m)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsupported a stone roof, as evidenced by three in situ corbels supporting a single piece of stone sheathing. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlintel over the entranceway (1.2 m x 70 cm) is still place. There is a small niche in the west wall of the south\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\troom.
