The <span class=\"popular\">Dzuntrül Puk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdzu ’phrul phug</span> subterranean chamber is situated in a walled compound, planted on top of a ridgeline that bounds the right or south side of the <span class=\"popular\">Nyilung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Nyi lung</span> valley (5100 m). There are no permanent contemporary habitations in the proximity of <span class=\"popular\">Dzuntrül Puk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdzu ’phrul phug</span>, in part, because of its high elevation. All walls at the site have a random-rubble texture and are of the dry-mortar type or were minimally mud mortared. These walls are composed of uncut, variable-sized igneous rocks, which average 30 cm to 60 cm in length. Even the corbels and bridging stones were unhewn. The walls of the various <span class=\"popular emph\">do khang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rdo khang</span> are 60 cm to 80 cm in thickness. </p> <p>There are three major sectors at <span class=\"popular\">Dzuntrül Puk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdzu ’phrul phug</span>: upper south, lower south and north. The upper south sector (Residential structures RS1, RS2 and RS3) is situated on slopes elevated high above the right side of the <span class=\"popular\">Nyilung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Nyi lung</span> valley head. The north sector (Residential structures RS4 to RS17) is spread across a shelf perched above the left side of the upper <span class=\"popular\">Nyilung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Nyi lung</span> valley in a locale known as mtho mo (sp.?), at somewhat lower elevation than the upper south sector. The lower south sector includes <span class=\"popular\">Dzuntrül Puk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdzu ’phrul phug</span> proper and the residential structures in its immediate vicinity (Residential structures RS18 to RS24). These are found on the ridge bounding the right side of the upper <span class=\"popular\">Nyilung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Nyi lung</span> valley. In total, this large religious center could have housed well over 150 residents. In contrast, <span class=\"popular\">sezhik</span><span class=\"scholar\">Se zhig</span> monastery probably never held more than several dozen practitioners. </p> "},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":" <p> <span class=\"popular\">Dzuntrül Puk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdzu ’phrul phug</span> is probably so named because in a popular folktale it is believed to have been magically constructed. According to the senior-most Bon scholar <span class=\"popular\">Loppön Tendzin Namdak</span><span class=\"scholar\">Slob dpon bstan ’dzin rnam dag</span>, who spent two and a half years based at <span class=\"popular\">sezhik</span><span class=\"scholar\">Se zhig</span> monastery, most ruins in the vicinity of <span class=\"popular\">Dzuntrül Puk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdzu ’phrul phug</span> were probably founded in the Tibetan imperial period (617-841 CE) by an individual named <span class=\"popular\">Dzibön Wangdrup</span><span class=\"scholar\">’Dzi bon dbang grub</span>. According to a popular legend, when the circa 13th century CE Bon adept <span class=\"popular\">Namkha Loden</span><span class=\"scholar\">Nam mkha’ blo ldan</span> came to the locale, he was met by the mountain deity <span class=\"popular\">Ngomar Lhatsen</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ngo dmar lha btsan</span>, who offered to help him build a retreat center. The mountain god told him, “If you build the walls, I will build the roof. If you build the roof, I will build the walls.” <span class=\"popular\">Namkha Loden</span><span class=\"scholar\">Nam mkha’ blo ldan</span> decided it would be easier for him to build the walls. After the saint was done with his task, <span class=\"popular\">Ngomar Lhatsen</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ngo dmar lha btsan</span>simply took a large boulder and flung it upon the walls, completing the construction of <span class=\"popular\">Dzuntrül Puk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdzu ’phrul phug</span>. The roof of the structure was too low, however, and <span class=\"popular\">Namkha Loden</span><span class=\"scholar\">Nam mkha’ blo ldan</span> kept banging his head. One day, in order to make the ceiling higher, he took his <span class=\"popular emph\">shang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">gshang</span> and sliced off a piece of the boulder comprising the roof. </p> "},{"title":"Site elements","index":6,"parent_index":2,"body":" "},{"title":"rDzu ’phrul phug","index":7,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p> <span class=\"popular\">Dzuntrül Puk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdzu ’phrul phug</span> stands on the broad crest of the ridge enclosing the right side of the upper <span class=\"popular\">Nyilung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Nyi lung</span>valley. It is comprised of a walled compound (16.5 m x 13 m) whose entrance is in the southeast. Three steps lead up to the entrance, which opens onto a courtyard. In the rear of the compound there are four interconnected rooms that ostensibly were used as chapels and/or as meditation residences. The entrance (1.5 m x 70 cm) to the freestanding northeast room (3 m x 2.5 m x 2 m) is in the west. The design of the walls (long, straight and uniform) indicates that the northeast room supported a wooden roof, the only structure at the site that appears to have done so. There is a niche and a well-built hearth against the west wall. The timber roof, relatively large entranceway and the presence of a large window (30 cm x 60 cm) in the east wall of the northeast room seem to indicate that its establishment or reconstruction postdates other<span class=\"popular\">Dzuntrül Puk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdzu ’phrul phug</span> structures. This modification of the northeast room must be related to its close proximity to the subterranean chamber of<span class=\"popular\">Dzuntrül Puk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdzu ’phrul phug</span>, the geomantic heart of the site. </p> <p>Next to the northeast room, at the very rear of the compound, is the northwest chamber. This appears to have been the main sanctum at <span class=\"popular\">Dzuntrül Puk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdzu ’phrul phug</span>. Five steps lead down to this subterranean chamber. Its roof is a naturally occurring boulder whose rear side is level with the surface of the ridge-top. In order to build this chamber the soil underneath this boulder had to be removed. The overlying boulder is supported by the masonry walls lining the chamber (4 m x 3.3 m x standing room). There is an altar with a large bay constructed of stone and mud against the rear or west wall. There are three niches in the west wall and one niche in the south wall. Pilgrims have affixed tufts of white wool, paper <span class=\"popular emph\">lungta</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rlung rta</span> and old protection cords (<span class=\"popular emph\">sungdü</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">srung mdud</span>) to the ceiling, as well as dabbing butter on it. There is a prayer flag mast on the roof of the rear of the chamber, supported by a 1-m high parapet wall. There are also a couple of large cairns in the vicinity.</p> <p>The central room of the <span class=\"popular\">Dzuntrül Puk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdzu ’phrul phug</span> compound is in very poor condition. Its forward wall is up to 1.3 m in height and its rear wall 2.3 m high. The rear wall of the central room forms part of the rear wall of the compound. The south room (2.2 m x 1.6 m) supported a stone roof, as evidenced by three in situ corbels supporting a single piece of stone sheathing. The lintel over the entranceway (1.2 m x 70 cm) is still place. There is a small niche in the west wall of the south room. Inside the compound as well as behind it there are old stone plaques mainly inscribed with the Bon <span class=\"popular emph\">matri</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma tri</span> and <span class=\"popular emph\">a a kar</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">a a dkar</span> mantras. Outside the compound, north of the subterranean main shrine room, there is the foundation of an independent building (2.5 m x 4 m). </p> "},{"title":"Upper south sector","index":8,"parent_index":6,"body":" "},{"title":"Residential Structure RS1","index":9,"parent_index":8,"body":" <p>Residential structure RS1 is located on a steep flank of the ridge (an outlier of <span class=\"popular\">Tago Ngömar Lhatsen</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rta rgo ngo dmar lha btsan</span>) that encloses the west side of the site. At 5180 m it is the highest elevation structure at <span class=\"popular\">Dzuntrül Puk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdzu ’phrul phug</span>. RS1 has been reduced to fragmentary 80-cm thick foundation walls that stretch for 5.5 m. It is primarily built of stones 40 cm to 60 cm in length. This isolated structure was raised against a large igneous boulder. </p> "},{"title":"Residential Structure RS2","index":10,"parent_index":8,"body":" <p>Residential structure RS2 is situated on the slope below RS1 (5150 m). This large ceremonial building or multifaceted shrine complex can be divided into south, central and north sections. The extant physical evidence is not sufficient to determine if RS2 had a residential component or was solely a group of <span class=\"popular emph\">tenkhar</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rten mkhar</span>-like shrines. This uniquely designed installation was constructed of stones mainly 40 cm to 80 cm in length. </p> <p>The south section of RS2 consists of two square rooms or cubic shrine structures that measure 3 m (north-south) x 7.2 m (east-west). The south section structures have completely collapsed, making positive identification of their function difficult. The west room or structure is less disintegrated and has standing walls (1.5 m to 1.7 m in height) surrounding a cavity. </p> <p>The central section of RS2 was comprised of a row of quadrate rooms or shrines, which measure 4 m (north-south) x 16 m (east-west). Standing wall fragments are between 1 m and 1.7 m. The westerly or upslope structure is the most intact part of the central section, and has a cavity in the middle. </p> <p>The north section of RS2 is dominated by a tiered shrine structure that is probably of the <span class=\"popular emph\">tenkhar</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rten mkhar</span> class (or alternatively, it was a receptacle for votive clay figurines known as <span class=\"popular emph\">Tsatsa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">tshwa tshwa</span>). This shrine measures 2.8 m x 3 m, and is 1.5 m high on its west or upslope flank and 2.5 m high on its down-slope side. The west side of the base consists of five graduated tiers, each made up of a single course of worked stones. In the upper part of the shrine there are openings on the south, west and north sides. Inside this tiered shrine are highly deteriorated small conical <span class=\"popular emph\">Tsatsa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">tshwa tshwa</span>. One older <span class=\"popular emph\">Tsatsa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">tshwa tshwa</span> with the image of a Bon (?) deity was also found.

The heavily built roof of the tiered shrine consists of bridging stones and slab sheathing. Adjacent to this shrine there is another specimen in poorer condition, which measures 3.5 m (north-west) x 2 m (east-west) x a maximum of 1.4 m. On the north side of the RS2 complex there are the square bases of two smaller shrines.
