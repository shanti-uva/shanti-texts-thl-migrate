It consists of a series of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tterraces and much building rubble spread over the lower slopes of a hill, as well as a highly degraded summit\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcomplex. The site appears to be that of a fortified settlement consisting of a stronghold built above a village.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNo contemporary centers of sedentary occupation are found in the <span class=\"popular\">Wangchu</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dbang chu</span> valley. The <span class=\"popular\">Wangchu</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dbang chu</span> watercourse now only flows intermittently. <span class=\"popular\">Wangdrak Puk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dbang brag phug</span> must have been founded when the locale still possessed a more\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\treliable supply of water. The lower site covers approximately 3000 m&sup2; and begins at the base of the hill. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\teasily defended summit complex contains various protective wall fragments and several small caves. The highly\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdissolute state of the ruins, the small staggered rampart fragments, the absence of Buddhist\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlandmarks, and its weak representation in the local oral tradition point to the archaic status of <span class=\"popular\">Wangdrak Puk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dbang brag phug</span>.

Traces of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfootings of retaining walls are found along the edges of the terraces. The largest intact wall fragment is 11 m\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin length and 50 cm in height.

The summit complex is almost entirely surrounded by escarpments that could not have been\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\teasily scaled. All extant structures have a mud-mortared random-rubble texture made of unhewn stones\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(generally 15 cm to 60 cm long). These structures are highly disintegrated and few coherent wall segments\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tremain. Below the summit on a small shoulder is a building site (8 m x 14 m) reduced to scattered stones. Just\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbelow the shoulder is a wall segment built into the slope, 2 m in length and 60 cm in height. Higher up, in a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsteep gully below the summit, there are two defensive walls segments spaced 8 m vertical apart. The lower\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tspecimen is 2.2 m in length and 1.2 m in height. The upper specimen (located just below the rim of the summit)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tis 1.5 m long and 1.5 m in height. Between these two walls, which must have fully spanned the gully, there is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhat appears to be the footing of another wall. These structures must have functioned to protect the summit\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(40 m x 8 m) from approaching attackers. The south summit (side most vulnerable to incursion) seems to have\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen fully encircled by a wall but little of it is still extant. The largest fragment of this defensive wall\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tis only 1 m in length and 1 m in height, and contains just 20 stones (up to 50 cm in length). The summit is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstrewn with rubble, but there is very little indication of what kinds of structures were once fixed here. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Summit caves","index":10,"parent_index":8,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>In the earth and gravel formation of the east side of the summit there are six small caves.
