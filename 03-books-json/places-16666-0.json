The tallest standing stone in he group has a somewhat rectilinear form (1.2 m [height] x 2 m [basal girth]). Next to it are at least four other dark-colored standing stones planted in the ground in a line, as well as other stones dispersed in close proximity. It could not be determined whether these stones constitute an artifact or a geofact. If indeed they were erected by humans, they represent a more primitive pillar typology, the likes of which have not been documented elsewhere in Upper Tibet. </p>
