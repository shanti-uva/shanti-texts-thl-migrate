Tibetan is particularly sensitive to situation and environment, as well as the sources of information on which a speaker\u2019s assertions are based. It would be therefore appropriate to speak of a \u201csituational grammar.\u201d<\/p><p class=\"Paragraph\">For example, Tibetan uses evidential or \u201cmediatory\u201d auxiliaries, which reveal whether or not the speaker directly witnessed whatever he or she is stating to be the case. When a statement cannot be immediately associated with a concrete situation of communication, Tibetans tend not to accept it or to find it strange. One consequence of this attitude is a reluctance to present verbs in a series of conjugations. For example, when the verb \u201cto be\u201d is \u201cmechanically\u201d conjugated (\u201cI am a student,\u201d \u201cyou are a student,\u201d etc.), Tibetan speakers will accept the first person without any trouble but often stop short at the second, since the absence of a marked intonation makes it difficult for them to imagine a situation in which they would be telling someone, \u201cYou\u2019re a student!\u201d since the addressee is obviously in a better position than they are to know this.<\/p>","title":"The Importance of Situation and Context"}]}
