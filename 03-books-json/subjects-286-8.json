   "body": "<p class=\"Paragraph\">In languages in general, statements are rooted in a given situation or context. Tibetan is particularly sensitive to situation and environment, as well as the sources of information on which a speaker’s assertions are based. It would be therefore appropriate to speak of a “situational grammar.”</p><p class=\"Paragraph\">For example, Tibetan uses evidential or “mediatory” auxiliaries, which reveal whether or not the speaker directly witnessed whatever he or she is stating to be the case. When a statement cannot be immediately associated with a concrete situation of communication, Tibetans tend not to accept it or to find it strange. One consequence of this attitude is a reluctance to present verbs in a series of conjugations. For example, when the verb “to be” is “mechanically” conjugated (“I am a student,” “you are a student,” etc.), Tibetan speakers will accept the first person without any trouble but often stop short at the second, since the absence of a marked intonation makes it difficult for them to imagine a situation in which they would be telling someone, “You’re a student!” since the addressee is obviously in a better position than they are to know this.</p>",
