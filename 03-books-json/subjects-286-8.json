Tibetan is particularly sensitive to situation and environment, as well as the sources of information on which a speaker&rsquo;s assertions are based. It would be therefore appropriate to speak of a &ldquo;situational grammar.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"Paragraph\">For example, Tibetan uses evidential or &ldquo;mediatory&rdquo; auxiliaries, which reveal whether or not the speaker directly witnessed whatever he or she is stating to be the case. When a statement cannot be immediately associated with a concrete situation of communication, Tibetans tend not to accept it or to find it strange. One consequence of this attitude is a reluctance to present verbs in a series of conjugations. For example, when the verb &ldquo;to be&rdquo; is &ldquo;mechanically&rdquo; conjugated (&ldquo;I am a student,&rdquo; &ldquo;you are a student,&rdquo; etc.), Tibetan speakers will accept the first person without any trouble but often stop short at the second, since the absence of a marked intonation makes it difficult for them to imagine a situation in which they would be telling someone, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a student!&rdquo; since the addressee is obviously in a better position than they are to know this.</p>","title":"The Importance of Situation and Context"}]}
