This is one of the Bonpo monasteries that has a long\n                        history. It was destroyed in 1641 when Mongolian troops led by Gushri Khan\n                        bsTan &rsquo;dzin chos rgyal invaded Tibet. Reconstruction was undertaken in\n                        1917.</p>\n\n                     <p>In the time of gNya&rsquo; khri btsan po, the teachings of Bon became widespread\n                        in Tibet. During this period, however, the monastery experienced a rise and\n                        fall, and met with great misfortune in that many masters of Bon gshen\n                        scattered to mDo khams and the nomad area because of the religious\n                        oppression by bTsan po Khri srong lde btsan. In the nomad area, those Bon\n                        gshen masters who had escaped established many monastic communities in order\n                        to get a foot-hold there, so that the precious teachings of Eternal Bon did\n                        not degenerate. At that time Khyung po A bla grags pa and Sha ba rang grol,\n                        who both came from the upper Dwang ra Khyung rdzong, established Sog gYung\n                        drung &rsquo;dzin pa&rsquo;i gling monastery and greatly increased the number of monks.\n                        The three deeds of keeping, defending and spreading the precious teachings\n                        of Eternal Bon became widespread everywhere.</p>\n\n                     <p>However, at the same time, Gushri bsTan &rsquo;dzin chos rgyal first captured mDo\n                        khams and then gradually penetrated gTsang by waging war against Karma bstan\n                        skyong dbang po, the king of gTsang, and brought it under his control.</p>\n\n                     <p>In 1642, the Tibetan government began to organize itself and the doctrine of\n                        the dGe lugs pa sect began to spread widely in Tibet. Simultaneously, a\n                        large number of monastic communities of the bKa&rsquo; rgyud pa and Eternal Bon\n                        were, as a matter of course, destroyed by the military power of Gushri bsTan\n                        &rsquo;dzin chos rgyal. Many Bonpo monks and nuns were ferociously tortured and\n                        eventually murdered. After that, although Khyung po bsTan rgyal grags pa,\n                        Khri bde gung grags and Khyung po &rsquo;Bun snang tried their best to practise\n                        the three deeds &ldquo;keeping, defending and spreading the teachings&rdquo; they\n                        gradually declined. </p>\n\n                     <p>At that time, Khyung po Nang chen grags pa brought the statue Zhi kro rgyab\n                        bkrod and other religious objects to A smad district and took care of the\n                        monastery of Khyung po sBa nag bla brang. Khyung po sMan ri grags pa, gShen\n                        sras grags pa and sNang gsal grags pa are said to have followed successively\n                        in the line of this Bla brang.</p>\n\n                     <p>A brag sPyi ba grags pa then put up a yak-hair tent on the pastureland so\n                        that they could declare that their monastery was settled there. They raised\n                        funds and scraped together enough monastic implements, including the\n                        offerings to the deities and costumes for religious dance. Besides that,\n                        they also obtained many religious objects such as the Zhi khro rgyab bkrod\n                        and other invaluable relics. Gathering a number of devotees in the nomad\n                        area, they performed prayer services and rituals to the satisfaction of the\n                        people.</p>\n\n                     <p>There were about twenty, mostly tantric practitioners, but some of them were\n                        real monks. They practised chanting and meditation. They performed religious\n                        services based on the ritual cycles of dBal gsas, gTso mchog, Phur pa, sTag\n                        la and Byams ma. They also propitiated Srid pa rgyal mo drel nag, Mi bdud, A\n                        bse, rGyal po Nyi pang sad and dGra bla&rsquo;i rgyal mo. Since they performed\n                        these rituals extensively, the monastery became the object of worship for\n                        the people, for this life and hereafter.</p>\n\n                     <p>From among these lamas came bsTan &rsquo;dzin grags pa in the lineage of sBra nag\n                        bla brang, who had accomplished complete deliverance from every attachment\n                        of this world. But after his leaving for the purest land Bon dbyings (after\n                        his death), even the sBra nag bla brang lineage fell into a state like that\n                        of a rosary broken into pieces. Later on, this situation caused the sBra nag\n                        bla brang to invite, willingly or unwillingly, lamas of the Khyung po\n                        lineage from A stod district.</p>\n\n                     <p>About the same time, in 1880, dBang phyug gYung drung tshul khrims, an\n                        accomplished yogi of the Nag ru lineage, one of the three lineages of Khyung\n                        po &ldquo;White, Black and Yellow&rdquo; was born, emitting many auspicious signs. From\n                        childhood, gYung drung tshul khrims had inborn knowledge quite unlike all\n                        other children. Being a master in the fields of calligraphy and arithmetic,\n                        he became the one most admired by all the laity and priests. When he grew\n                        up, he felt so deeply sad about the cyclic existences that he made\n                        pilgrimages to Central Tibet, Mount Kailash in Western Tibet, Bon ri in of\n                        Kong po; and when he visited monasteries including sMan ri (No.1), gYung\n                        drung gling (No.2) and mKhar sna (No.7) and he studied under many matchless\n                        teachers to receive initiations and instructions of outer, inner and secret.\n                        He then thoroughly learned the Sutra, Tantra and rDzogs chen. Adjusting\n                        himself to the monastery, he took the full ordination of Drang srong,\n                        consisting of 256 vows.</p>\n\n                     <p>A prophecy was made at that time by sKal bzang nyi ma, the great abbot of\n                        gYung drung gling, that a new monastery would be built in sNye rong\n                        district. In accordance with the prophecy, a large group of devotees of Bon\n                        having united with some leaders of Shag chu smad community in sNye rong\n                        rdzong apprised mKhan chung Grags rnam, the governor-general of Hor that\n                        they would establish Chab mdo dPal gShen bstan gYung drung bde chen gling,\n                        which they did in 1917.</p>\n\n                     <p>gYung drung tshul khrims maintained the monastery by the observation of\n                        monastic discipline, such as the Three Trainings, in consequence of which he\n                        became the very guide of the three deeds of keeping, defending and spreading\n                        the precious teachings of gShen. Furthermore, he developed his unique\n                        abilities: he left a number of handprints and footprints all around the\n                        monastery, including places on the hills in front and at the rear; the flag\n                        of his reputation as Chab mdo rTogs ldan fluttered high.</p>\n\n                     <p>However, due to the unfortune of devotees, he died on the 23rd day of the\n                        eighth month, 1947 with the signs of summer thunder booming through the sky\n                        above the monastery.</p>\n\n                     <p>After that, until the Cultural Revolution, the monastery was looked after by\n                        his nephew, Bla chung tshe dpag of the Khyung po Nag ru family. During this\n                        time the monastery was enlarged and the necessary religious objects, such as\n                        statues, scriptures, stupas and implements of offerings, were greatly\n                        increased. Among many Bonpo establishments, this monastery had the high\n                        reputation of having grown just like a lotus that comes out of the mire.</p>\n\n                     \n\n                        "},{"title":"Religious objects and rituals of the monastery:","index":3,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n\n                        \n\n                           "},{"title":"sKu gdung lha khang","index":4,"parent_index":3,"body":"\n\n                           <p>The main religious object of this three-storey temple was the\n                              gilt-bronze reliquary stupa of the sage of Chab mdo, gYung drung tshul\n                              khrims, in the style of the gYung drung bkod legs stupa, as tall as a\n                              two-storey house.
