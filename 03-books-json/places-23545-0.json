History","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":" <p>There are two versions: according to the <em xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\">R\u1e0dza s\u1e6deng chen dgon gyi lo rgyus<\/em> by Tshe dbang &rsquo;gyur med, the monastery was founded by rMe&rsquo;u A yu dang ra, according another one it was founded by rMe&rsquo;u Grub chen Nam mkha&rsquo; g-yung drung.<\/p> <p>The monastery&rsquo;s original name was bsTan pa &rsquo;gyur med sTeng chen rnam rgyal gling. At first, the family of rMe&rsquo;u, who was based in gTsang, was in charge of the monastery, but unfortunately the history of this lineage remains obscure. However, later dBra ston lHa yi blo gros (his dates are not known, but he is believed to have been a contemporary of &rsquo;Gro mgon &rsquo;Phags pa, 1235-1280) from dBra dgon Monastery in dKar mdzes came to sTeng chen where he later settled and hence started a rMe&rsquo;u lineage. It is said that dBra ston founded twenty monasteries in dBus gtsang, Khams and Amdo. He extended sTeng chen Monastery by building the gTsug lag khang and also enlarged the temple. His successor was dBra pa &rsquo;Dul ba rgyal mtshan who received his ordination from mNyam med Shes rab rgyal mtshan, founder of sMan ri Monastery. dBra pa &rsquo;Dul ba rgyal mtshan first went to gYas ru dBen sa kha Monastery in gTsang. He is referred to as &rsquo;Gro mgon dBra ston chen mo and is said to be one of the Eighteen Masters (<span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">ston pa bco brgyad<\/span>) of gYas ru dben sa Monastery. He was succeeded in turn by dBra pa Tshul khrims rgyal mtshan who studied the <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">A khrid<\/span>, <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">rDzogs chen<\/span> and <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">sNyan rgyud<\/span> traditions under rMe&rsquo;u mKhas pa dPal chen. The period from Tshul khrims rgyal mtshan&rsquo;s time to that of dBra ba sKal bzang nyi ma remains obscure. dBra ba sKal bzang nyi ma was born in the Iron-Hare Year in the 15th Rab byung (1891). During his time, in 1902, sTeng chen Monastery was burned down by the monks of the nearby dGe lugs pa monastery of dGon gsar, because the dGon gsar monks believed that the assembly hall of sTeng chen prevented the sunlight from reaching their monastery (i.e. the monks of dGon gsar Monastery were jealous of the height and grandeur of sTeng chen Monastery). I am sure there are two sides to this story but unfortunately I could not find any Sources containing dGon gsar Monastery&rsquo;s version of the events. In any case the monastery was burned down by the dGon gsar monks and more than twenty buildings and all the statues and texts within were completely destroyed. sKal bzang nyi ma fled to Hor in the Nag chu kha region, and the elder monks to gSer thar pasture. <\/p> <p>In 1905, sTeng chen Monastery sent a group of representatives from sTeng chen and other monasteries, accompanied by two lDing dpon officers from Nyag rong to Lhasa to request permission to rebuild the monastery. gNas brtan gYung drung bstan pa, the representative of sTeng chen Monastery, related the events to the sPyi khyab mKhan po of the bKa&rsquo; shag in Lhasa (the highest monk official in the Dalai Lama&rsquo;s government), who reported the story to the 13th Dalai Lama. The Dalai Lama granted the monastery permission to rebuild and the sPyi khyab mkhan po sent a government representative together with A rta, one of the lDing dpon officers of Nyag rong, to rDza khog to act as mediators between the two monasteries. 1908 marked the beginning of the monastery&rsquo;s reconstruction. The work was supervised by dBra spyul sKal bzang nyi ma and dBra dpon rNam rgyal grags pa, the local chief. Shar rdza bKra shis rgyal mtshan and dBra sras Zla ba grags pa also largely contributed to the reconstruction and revival of the monastery. In 1916, the work was completed and the monastery was renamed dPal gShen bstan mdo sngags g-yung drung bstan rgyas gling. Shar rdza bKra shis rgyal mtshan was responsible for the iconographic programme of its interior decoration. Many famous Bonpo masters visited the monastery, including Khro tshang &rsquo;Brug lha, gSer chen Sangs rgyas gling pa, Kun grol &rsquo;ja&rsquo; tshon snying po, mKhan chen Nyi ma bstan &rsquo;dzin, and the &ldquo;three lineages of dBra, lCang and sMon&rdquo;, (dBra lCang sMon gsum):<\/p> <ol type=\"1\"> <li>the masters of the dBra lineage from sTeng chen Monastery <\/li> <li>the masters of the lCang lung lineage from lCang lung Monastery (No.158)<\/li> <li>the masters of the sMon rgyal lineage from sMon rgyal Monastery (No.136) <\/li> <\/ol> <p>sTeng chen Monastery was famous for a number of its practitioners who obtained the &lsquo;rainbow-body&rsquo; (<span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">&rsquo;ja&rsquo; lus<\/span>) at the time of their deaths.
