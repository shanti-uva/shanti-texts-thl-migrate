   "body": "<p>A Thousand-household District (<em>stong sde</em>) is a military and administrative division of Imperial Tibet during the eighth and ninth centuries. The thousand-household districts were administered by larger administrative units called \"horns\" (<em>ru</em>). Originally all horns didn't have the same number of thousand-household districts, but in 744 a territorial reorganisation balanced the disparities between horns. This is why the affiliation of some of the thousand-household districts changed horn-affiliation in 744.</p>
<p>The name is derived from it being a district supposed to provide a regiment of one thousand soldiers, or alternatively, that it is a district of one thousand households. Either way, each household was supposed to provide one solidier for the imperial army.</p>
