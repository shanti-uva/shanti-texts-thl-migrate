It is reported to have been destroyed sometime during the Chinese Communist period and the pillars moved a short distance away to serve as the entrance to a corral. This corral is situated just south of the main road that links <span class=\"popular\">Tsakha</span><span class=\"scholar\">Tshwa kha</span> and <span class=\"popular\">Gegyé</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dge rgyas</span>. The largest pillar is a well-hewn four-sided stone that projects 1 m above the ground surface and has a girth of 1 m. The other pillars are considerably smaller. A grayish grained stone was selected for use as the standing stones. North of the main road there are wall traces on gently sloping ground. These structural traces ostensibly belonged to he enclosure in which the pillars were erected. </p>
