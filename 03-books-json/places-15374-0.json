The valley is at about 7500' above sea-level, extends from the north to south, and is surrounded by 9000' peaks. The region is similar in appearance to parts of the state of New Mexico in the US, with sparsely vegetated red-colored hills, though the river plain supports lush farming. Forests are rare and mostly in higher elevations, or near monasteries, which provide some protection from over-harvesting.<\/p><p>In terms of political history, the region came under central leadership during the Mongol imperial period (thirteenth to fourteenth centuries), when the Sakya (<span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\"><em>sa skya<\/em><\/span><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">)<\/span><em> <\/em>politico-religious influence on the region led to the establishment of a local ruler.

With the rise of the Geluk tradition, from the seventeenth century <span class=\"place\" title=\"F1169 \">Repgong <\/span>was ruled under a system of joint religious and political rule by the Shar (<em>shar<\/em><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">)<\/span><em> <\/em>incarnation lineage of <span class=\"place\" title=\"F23075 \">Rongwo Monastery<\/span> and the Nangso institution.
