He is believed to have obtained the\n                        &lsquo;rainbow body&rsquo; (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">&rsquo;ja&rsquo; lus</span>). His popularity and influence\n                        over the Bonpo community and culture continue to grow, especially in Khams\n                        and Amdo where more and more statues of him are appearing in Bonpo and even\n                        Buddhist monasteries. Both an accomplished spiritual master and scholar, his\n                        teachings, contained within the eighteen volumes of his collected works,\n                        have become a fundamental reference in Bon. His history of the Bon religion\n                        was translated into English and analyzed by Samten G. Karmay, and published\n                        under the title of <em xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\">The Treasury of Good Sayings:\n                           A Tibetan History of Bon</em> (London Oriental Series, Vol.26, Oxford\n                        University Press, 1972). </p>\n\n                     <p>At the age of thirty-three, Shar rdza bKra shis rgyal mtshan (1890, the\n                        biography, pp.112-119) established the hermitage; during his life time, it\n                        was occupied only by his disciples who gathered there to receive his\n                        teachings and practise meditation under his guidance. After his\n                        extraordinary death at the hermitage, the place became a holy site not only\n                        for Bonpos, but also for Buddhists, and large gatherings of Bonpo tantric\n                        practitioners from Khams and Amdo take place there. As a result the\n                        hermitage has been enlarged and has become one of Tibet&rsquo;s major religious\n                        sites.

Indeed, sMan\n                        ri and gYung drung gling were the only place for Bonpo monks to pursue their\n                        studies and obtain the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">dge bshes</span> degree (for an account\n                        of the two monasteries see Nos.1 and 2). Monks who had been to these two\n                        monasteries were generally highly respected back in their own monasteries.\n                        Although this is still true to some extent, the situation has changed\n                        considerably since the Cultural Revolution. Thus sMan ri and gYung drung\n                        gling no longer receive the support it used to and are gradually losing\n                        their influence throughout the whole Tibetan cultural area; they no longer\n                        run the complete programme of Bonpo studies leading to the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">dge bshes</span> degree which formerly attracted monks from as far as Amdo\n                        and Khams. In the meantime Shar rdza bKra shis rgyalmtshan&rsquo;s influence,\n                        owing to his scholarly and spiritual accomplishments and miraculous death,\n                        has been steadily growing, and, moreover, Shar rdza Hermitage is much closer\n                        than sMan ri or gYung drung gling for the Bonpo monks of Amdo and Khams.\n                        Thus, at present most Bonpo monasteries in Amdo and Khams send their monks\n                        to Shar rdza Hermitage instead of sMan ri or gYung drung gling. The number\n                        of monks at the hermitage varies and there is a constant turn over.
