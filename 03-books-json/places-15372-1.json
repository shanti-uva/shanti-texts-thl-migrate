   "body": "<p>Golok (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">mgo log</span></em>) is a distinct ethno-cultural region by virtue of its dialects, origin narratives, tribal and clan groupings, explicit identity statements, and life-style and ecology. The dialects spoken in the Golok region are a variation of nomadic Amdo dialects ('brog skad), distinct from the farming areas to the north and east, but grading into the Ngawa (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">rnga ba</span></em>) dialect to the southeast, and running up against the Kham dialects (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">khams skad</span></em>) of Yushu to the southwest. In contemporary China, there is a <span class=\"place\" title=\"1180\">Golok Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture</span> based on this perceived unity. The areas around Golok are more difficult in terms of classification. Pastoralist communities extend from Golok southeast through Ngawa (<em><span class=\"tibetan\">rnga ba</span></em>), Mewa (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">rme ba</span></em>) and Dzögé (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">mdzod dge</span></em>), which have traditionally been referred to as Shimdrok (also pronounced Zhingdrok, <em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">zhing 'brog</span></em>). They are quite similar to Golok, and thus their most natural classification is not immediately apparent.</p>",
