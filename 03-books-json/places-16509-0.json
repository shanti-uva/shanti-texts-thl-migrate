A series of walls circumscribe a nearly 170 m wide section of the slope. On\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ta rocky spur, on the east end of this sector, there is a fragmentary wall section, 5 m in length and up to 60 cm\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin height. Below it, a wall runs along a steep slope in a westerly direction for 26 m to another spur. It skirts\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe edge of a saddle. Much of this wall has been leveled to its footings. Beyond the spur, the wall continues to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttraverse the slope for another 30 m to the west. In some places it encloses small saddles that may have\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsupported buildings, but too little is left to make a determination. Little bits of wall, up to 1 m in height,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tare found at these locations. Another rampart extends 30 m west of the spur, gaining about 3 m in elevation. It\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tencloses a 3-m wide natural terrace. Above the east side of this terrace there are the foundations (8 m x 6 m)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof what may have been a building constructed next to a cliff. Within the rubble of this structure is a single\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstone slab 1.5 m in length that was possibly used as a roofing element. At the western terminus of the 30-m long\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdefensive walls there is another highly deteriorated transverse rampart section that encloses a terrace, 6 m to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t8 m in width. It is 35 m in length. This wall is interrupted in the west by an outcrop. Beyond it there is the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmost westerly rampart, a wall that extends for 40 m along the edge of another terrace, which is 2.5 m to 6.5 m\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twide. Below the two westernmost ramparts there may have been two other rampart sections bounding terraces. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Summit ramparts","index":9,"parent_index":6,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>On the north summit crest, a 13-m long wall fences in the west side of a 100 m&sup2; saddle (5000 m).
