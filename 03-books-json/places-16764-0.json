The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tterrain is level and gravelly.

The slab walls (40 cm to 60 cm thick), the predominant type at the site, are\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgenerally aligned in the cardinal directions. Primarily, an unhewn light brown stone of variable length (30 cm to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t80 cm) was used in their construction. Many of these stones host orange climax lichen. The light brown stones were\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinstalled in the ground edgewise and project 5 cm to 25 cm above the surface. There are also a few contrasting\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twall sections made from pieces of gray limestone (10 cm to 25 cm long) that are set flush with the ground surface.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>In this region (<span class=\"popular\">Gerts&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sger rtse</span>), sites such as\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"popular\">Sergam M&ouml;ndur</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gser sgam mon dur</span> are closely associated\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twith the ancient <span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span>.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Site elements","index":6,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The fragmentary nature of the <span class=\"popular\">Sergam</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gser sgam</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsuperstructures precluded a detailed assessment of their ground plans.
