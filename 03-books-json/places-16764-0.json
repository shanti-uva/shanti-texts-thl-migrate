The errain is level and gravelly. The variable-sized quadrate enclosures of sger sgam are joined together, and encompass an area measuring 48 m (north-south) x 17 m (east-west). The size and prominence of hese structures indicates that <span class=\"popular\">Sergam<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Gser sgam<\/span> was a relatively important funerary site. The slab walls (40 cm to 60 cm thick), the predominant type at the site, are generally aligned in the cardinal directions. Primarily, an unhewn light brown stone of variable length (30 cm to 80 cm) was used in their construction. Many of these stones host orange climax lichen. The light brown stones were installed in the ground edgewise and project 5 cm to 25 cm above the surface. There are also a few contrasting wall sections made from pieces of gray limestone (10 cm to 25 cm long) that are set flush with the ground surface. <\/p> "},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":" <p>In this region (<span class=\"popular\">Gertsé<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Sger rtse<\/span>), sites such as <span class=\"popular\">Sergam Möndur<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Gser sgam mon dur<\/span> are closely associated with the ancient <span class=\"popular\">Mön<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon<\/span>.<\/p> "},{"title":"Site elements","index":6,"parent_index":2,"body":" <p>The fragmentary nature of the <span class=\"popular\">Sergam<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Gser sgam<\/span> superstructures precluded a detailed assessment of their ground plans.
