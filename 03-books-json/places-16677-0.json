The enclosure appears to have been oriented to the intermediate points, and approximately \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmeasures 5.5 m (southwest-northeast) x 3.5 m (northwest-southeast). Although three of the enclosing walls are \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thighly dissolute, more than 50 percent of the northwest wall is intact, allowing for an assessment of its design \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcharacteristics. This double-course wall (45 cm to 60 cm thick) is composed of variable-length (35 cm to 65 cm) \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbeige and tan-colored slabs and blocks. The northwest wall is dominated by stones set into the ground edgewise, \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhich project 10 cm to 25 cm above ground level. Some stones were also laid flat.</p>\n"},{"title":"Pillars","index":8,"parent_index":6,"body":"\n<p>The main pillar is firmly rooted near the inner edge of the southwest wall, and is well centered in the \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tenclosure. This tabular pillar is 2 m in height, 30 cm to 35 cm wide and 11 cm to 20 cm thick. Its broad sides \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tare oriented to the southeast and northwest. A 1.2-m long, 50-cm wide sliver has been cleaved off the northeast \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tside of the pillar. This break occurred long ago, as indicated by the degree of repatination to which the \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfractured surfaces have been subjected. The well-formed stele has weathered from a light gray color to dark tan. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA number of stones are piled up around the base of the pillar. A counterclockwise swastika (12 cm high) was \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcarved near the top of the southeast face of the pillar. The wear and repatination of this carving indicate that \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tit is of considerable age. On the left arm of the swastika the Tibetan letter <span class=\"popular emph\">A</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">a&rsquo;</span> was much more recently engraved. Below this swastika there is an incomplete \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tor primitive specimen whose arms run at odds with the usual radial form of the symbol. It is highly worn as \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twell. The southeast side of the pillar also displays shallow pecking marks of significant age. On the southeast \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tside of the main pillar there is a small four-sided pillar broken 35 cm above ground level.</p>\n"},{"title":"Outlying structures","index":9,"parent_index":6,"body":"\n"},{"title":"Funerary Structure FS1","index":10,"parent_index":9,"body":"\n<p>Funerary structure FS1 is situated 85 m west of the pillar near the base of the <span class=\"popular\">Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo ring</span> outcrop, which bounds the <span class=\"popular\">Langchen Tsangpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Glang chen gtsang po</span>valley. This highly \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdeteriorated ovoid enclosure (5 m across) is slightly raised above the slope on its downhill side, while its \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tuphill side is set as much as 1.1 m below the slope. The enclosing walls are comprised of jumbled courses of \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvariable length (up to 50 cm long) blocks that were mostly laid flat.</p>\n"},{"title":"Funerary Structure FS2","index":11,"parent_index":9,"body":"\n<p>Funerary structure FS2 (roughly 3 m across) is situated 6 m northeast of FS1.

The \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdownhill/forward side of this wall is raised 1 m to 1.5 m above the slope, while its uphill/rear side is more \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tor less level with the slope. This poorly preserved wall exhibits jumbled courses of blocks that were laid \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tflat. The original texture of the wall remains quite uncertain. Along its southwest half three other walls \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tjoin it to produce an enclosure (13 m x 6 m). The rear wall of this enclosure is set about 1 m below the \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tslope. Slabs of stone up to 1.2 m in length are dispersed within the enclosure. Just below the southwest end \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the rear wall there are traces of another analogously built enclosure.</p>\n"},{"title":"Funerary Structure FS4","index":13,"parent_index":9,"body":"\n<p>Funerary structure FS4 (3.5 m across) is situated 9.5 m northwest of FS1.
