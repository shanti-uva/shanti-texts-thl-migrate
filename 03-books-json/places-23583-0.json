According to oral\n                     tradition, it was founded around in 1646. Its first bla ma was Nyi ma grags pa,\n                     born in rGyal rong; the second was Me thar, born in &rsquo;Ben da village of Khong\n                     yul in Dar rtse mdo; the third was born also in rGyal rong, but nobody seems to\n                     know his name. The monastery was destroyed during the Cultural Revolution and\n                     was rebuilt in the 1980s. </p>\n\n                  <p>In Dar rtse mdo there are some other Bonpo temples, such as Tshe ring, &rsquo;Phong\n                     mda&rsquo; and sTag rtse, but nothing is known about them. It is the lay people who\n                     look after them. They usually work with their families as farmers and go to the\n                     temples only for some annual rituals. Since my visit in Dar rtse mdo was\n                     coincidence with their harvest everybody had gone back to home for it. The only\n                     monks I met became monks very recently. They have never been in any kind of\n                     school and have just started to learn read and write Tibetan in that year.</p>\n\n               "}]}
