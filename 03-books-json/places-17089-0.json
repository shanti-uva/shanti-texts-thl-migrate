The early history of the monastery is relatively inconsequential, though beginning in the middle of the nineteenth century it became a center of the Ecumenical (<span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Rim\u00e9<\/span>; <em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ris med<\/span><\/em>) Movement and in the early twentieth century a center of scholastic studies in <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kham<\/span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">khams<\/span><\/em>). Since China\u2019s political liberalization in the nineteen-eighties the main temple, seminary, and retreat centers have been rebuilt and all are now thriving. Furthermore, <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dzongsar<\/span> is the administrative center for an innovative network of local initiatives aimed at cultural preservation and income generation.<\/p><p>The area of <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dzongsar<\/span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">rdzong gsar<\/span><\/em>) was home to an imperial-era temple named <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Jakhyi Lhakhang<\/span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">bya khyi lha khang<\/span><\/em>) that is said to date from the reign of <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Songtsen Gampo<\/span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">srong btsan sgam po<\/span><\/em>, 7<sup>th<\/sup> century). Biographies of early twelfth century figures from <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kham<\/span> portray it as a popular center of Buddhist learning. The founding legend of <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dzongsar<\/span> itself speaks of a yogi who arrived in the early twelfth century at the foot of the hill upon which <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dzongsar<\/span> was eventually built and inquired about its name. As the hill is called <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Lhats\u00e9<\/span> and his name was <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Trashi<\/span>, the temple he founded there was called <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Trashi Lhats\u00e9<\/span>. This yogi brought with him a single statue of Shakyamuni Buddha and the temple he built had only one pillar, thus it was nicknamed \u201cThe Temple of One Buddha and One Pillar\u201d (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">lha khang jo bo lha gcig ka gcig<\/span><\/em>). The ensuing religious community was originally affiliated with the <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kadampa<\/span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">bka\u2019 gdams pa<\/span><\/em>) sect. In the late thirteenth century it was caught up in a widespread conversion to the <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Sakya<\/span> sect of monasteries in <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kham<\/span> and has remained <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Sakya<\/span> ever since.<\/p><p>Historical knowledge of this establishment prior to the mid-seventeenth century is very fragmentary. One thing that is known is that the <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Mensh\u00f6<\/span> Valley was ruled as an outpost of the <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Lingtsang<\/span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">gling tshang<\/span><\/em>) Kingdom, the nominally <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Sakya<\/span> polity that was economically and politically powerful in the region from the thirteenth through seventeenth centuries. The family that founded the <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Deg\u00e9<\/span>\u00a0kingdom in the seventeenth century began working for the local <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Ling<\/span> ruler in the fifteenth century, until they defeated this powerbase in the 1630s and founded an independent kingdom. The <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Deg\u00e9<\/span> kingdom patronized the <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Ngor<\/span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ngor<\/span><\/em>) sub-sect of <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Sakya<\/span> and instituted the <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Ngor<\/span> ritual program at <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Tashi Lhats\u00e9<\/span> Monastery.<\/p><p>Traditional histories of <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dzongsar<\/span> are often structured around the offices of three lines of lamas that have been prominent over the centuries: the <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Gangna<\/span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">sgang sna<\/span><\/em>), <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Ngari<\/span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">mnga' ris<\/span><\/em>), and <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Khyents\u00e9<\/span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">mkhyen brtse<\/span><\/em>) lamas. The first <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Gangna<\/span> lama was born into the important <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Gangna<\/span> family of <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Luding\u00a0<\/span>(<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">klu sdings<\/span><\/em>). It is unclear exactly when this line of lamas was founded but it persisted for twenty-nine generations, all the lamas came from the same family, and the line has since died out. The <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Ngari<\/span>\u00a0line of lamas was founded in the seventeenth century by a member of the <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Gangna<\/span> family, <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Ngari Rapjampa Ts\u00fcltrim \u00d6zer<\/span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">mnga' ris rab 'byams pa tshul khrims 'od zer<\/span><\/em>). The first eighteen <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Ngari<\/span> lamas were appointed by the leaders of <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Ngor<\/span> Monastery in Central Tibet. After the death of the eighteenth <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Ngari<\/span> lama, <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">K\u00fcnga Jamyang<\/span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">kun dga' 'jam dbyangs<\/span><\/em>; 1877-1942), the lineage shifted from being elective to reincarnate and the \u201creincarnation\u201d of <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">K\u00fcnga Jamyang<\/span> was identified and raised to be the nineteenth <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Ngari<\/span> lama. The third, and most famous, of the <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dzongsar<\/span> lamas is the <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Khyents\u00e9<\/span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">mkhyen brtse<\/span><\/em>) line. The first was <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Jamyang Khyents\u00e9 Wangpo<\/span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">'jam dbyangs mkhyen brtse dbang po<\/span><\/em>; 1820-1892), a towering figure in nineteenth century <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Deg\u00e9<\/span>, <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Sakya<\/span>, and <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Nyingma<\/span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">rnying ma<\/span><\/em>) history. In the 1860s the <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Nyarong<\/span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">nyag rong<\/span><\/em>) warlord <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">G\u00f6npo Namgyel<\/span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">dgon po rnam rgyal<\/span><\/em>) destroyed <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dzongsar<\/span>, after which <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Khyents\u00e9<\/span> gradually rebuilt it over the succeeding decades, making it larger and grander than before.<\/p><p>The second <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Khyents\u00e9 Ch\u00f6kyi Lodr\u00f6<\/span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">chos kyi blo gros<\/span><\/em>; 1893-1959) was also a major figure in <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Deg\u00e9<\/span> religion and had a tremendous impact on <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dzongsar<\/span>. In 1918 he established the <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Khamj\u00e9<\/span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">khams rje<\/span><\/em>) seminary (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">bshad grwa<\/span><\/em>) below the monastery. Its curriculum was based on the so-called thirteen classics and the course of study lasted five years. There were nine successive abbots from the founding of the seminary to its closing during the Maoist period. Initially the student population fluctuated between sixty to one hundred monks. The seminary was reopened in the eighties and is now one of the more vigorous and strict seminaries in <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kham<\/span>. <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Ch\u00f6kyi Lodr\u00f6<\/span> also established the <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dzongsar<\/span> retreat college at <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Karmo Taktsang<\/span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">dkar mo stag tshang<\/span><\/em>), at the site where the great <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Mipam Chokl\u00e9 Namgyel<\/span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">mi pham\u00a0phyogs las\u00a0rnam rgyal<\/span><\/em>,\u00a01846-1912) lived in retreat for thirteen years while studying under the first <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Khyents\u00e9<\/span>.<\/p><p>A recent history of the monastery lists the temples, residences, and other facilities found at the monastery during its efflorescence in the first third of the twentieth century. There were nineteen temples, including the large assembly hall; the <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Uts\u00e9<\/span> printing house (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">dbu rtse par khang<\/span><\/em>); the households of the three lines of lamas; around 180 two-story monk\u2019s homes (belonging to the central monastery); the seminary, including its temples, teacher\u2019s residences, and 57 monk\u2019s rooms; the retreat center; the chapels at the <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dzamnang<\/span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">dzaM nang<\/span><\/em>) and <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Khyungtak<\/span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">khyung stag<\/span><\/em>); holy caves; and others. Nearly all of these structures and their priceless contents \u2013 books, icons, relics, crafts, and so on \u2013 were destroyed during the Cultural Revolution. The brave and farsighted lamas and local residents who survived the Maoist period began to rebuild <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dzongsar<\/span> in 1983.<\/p><p>In addition to reviving the essential pre-modern <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dzongsar<\/span> traditions, the current leaders of the monastery have also used their position in <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Deg\u00e9<\/span> society and the broader Buddhist world to found a number of projects aimed at cultural preservation and local income generation. Thus the <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Mensh\u00f6<\/span> valley is dotted with workshops, training centers, and health facilities that maintain traditional Tibetan arts and sciences and are staffed by local Tibetans. These include free standing facilities for tanka (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">thang ka<\/span><\/em>) painting, statue making, metalwork, pottery, woolen clothes, and Tibetan medicine (patient treatment and medicine production). The products made at these satellites of <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dzongsar<\/span> Monastery are held in very high regard and often demand exceeds supply. This is especially true for the tankas and statues produced at <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dzongsar<\/span>. The pottery workshop is one of the last of its kind and its trained potters are often called upon to set up temporary facilities at regional monasteries so that they can fill orders for hundreds of begging bowls. The medicine made at the <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dzongsar<\/span> hospital is thought to be especially effective because of the strict adherence to traditional recipes and the \u201cempowerment\u201d bestowed on the finished pills and powders by the monks of <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dzongsar<\/span>.\u00a0<\/p>","title":"Dzongsar Trashi Lhats\u00e9 Monastery"}]}
