At the age of thirteen, he became a\n                        disciple of Kun grol hum chen and studied with him for nine years. At the\n                        age of twenty-two, he went to central Tibet on a pilgrimage to Bon ri, Yar\n                        lung, rGyal rtse, bKra shis lhun po, Zhu tshang, Sa skya, gShen Dar sding,\n                        mKhar sna, sMan ri, gYung drung gling, Se ra, &rsquo;Bras spungs, dGa&rsquo; ldan and a\n                        number of other sacred sites.
