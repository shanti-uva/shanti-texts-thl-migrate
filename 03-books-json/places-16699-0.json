The array of pillars appended to an edifice is situated on a sandy level saddle,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhich connects a northeast-southwest running talus-blanketed ridgeline with higher slopes. From the site there are\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfairly open views in all directions. This funerary complex is situated 40 m north of funerary structure FS10 of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe E-23 site. The pillars and appended edifice are oriented somewhere in between the cardinal directions and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tintermediate points. All structures are made of uncut reddish and purplish slabs of volcanic talus. The extreme\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdegradation of the monument in part can be attributed to the unstable nature of the sandy substrate. This is the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tonly example surveyed to date of an array of pillars appended to an edifice (II.1c) that was built on the same\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\theights as cubic tombs (II.3). This proximity is likely to demonstrate a close functional and chronological link\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbetween these two types of monuments.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>According to the folklore of <span class=\"popular\">Oma</span><span class=\"scholar\">&rsquo;O ma</span>, at one time\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthere was a local chieftain who was extremely fond of wild yak (<span class=\"popular emph\">drong</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">&rsquo;brong</span>) hunting.
