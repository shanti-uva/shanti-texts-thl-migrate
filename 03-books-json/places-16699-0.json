   "body": "<p> <span class=\"popular\">Paktuk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Pags mthug</span> is located on one of a group of ridgelines of the same name. The array of pillars appended to an edifice is situated on a sandy level saddle, which connects a northeast-southwest running talus-blanketed ridgeline with higher slopes. From the site there are fairly open views in all directions. This funerary complex is situated 40 m north of funerary structure FS10 of he E-23 site. The pillars and appended edifice are oriented somewhere in between the cardinal directions and intermediate points. All structures are made of uncut reddish and purplish slabs of volcanic talus. The extreme degradation of the monument in part can be attributed to the unstable nature of the sandy substrate. This is the only example surveyed to date of an array of pillars appended to an edifice (II.1c) that was built on the same heights as cubic tombs (II.3). This proximity is likely to demonstrate a close functional and chronological link between these two types of monuments.</p>",

One day, because of all his killing, there were no wild yaks left in the region. In order to survive, he was reduced to boiling the skins of wild yaks and eating them. The name of the site, ‘Thick Hide’, is said to refer to this incident. </p>",
