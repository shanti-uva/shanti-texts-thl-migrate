Its walls are not as finely built as <span class=\"popular\">Pukchen</span><span class=\"scholar\">Phug chen</span> (B-27), but they have nonetheless proven\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdurable.

In order to build this extension stones were removed from <span class=\"popular\">Kyarang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Kya rang</span>, inflicting significant damage upon it. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t50-cm- to 70-cm-thick walls of the original structure are composed of random-rubble that was either of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdry-mortar variety or lightly mud mortared. Dark-colored slabs up to 1 m in length and between 5 cm and 15 cm\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthickness were employed in construction. In the north wall there is a slab 1.5 m in length, but it is unclear if\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthis is an original building material</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The entrance to the <span class=\"popular\">Kyarang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Kya rang</span> edifice is in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsouth and from it one enters a walled compound. There are no buildings on the east half of this walled up area and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tno signs that there ever was. The forward third of the west side of the compound is also open. In the central west\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tportion of the facility there is a residential structure. Its forward portion measures 3 m (north-south) x 4 m\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(east-west). The foundation of the highly dissolute forward portion of the edifice is elevated 50 cm above the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tforward or south slope. Its west/rear wall is up to 2 m in height and two corbels resting upon it extend 40 cm and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t50 cm over the floor space. These corbels are set 40 cm to 50 cm below the rim of the wall &ndash; bridging stones and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsheathing slabs must have rested upon them to meet the top of the walls. The rear room (3.1 m x 3.2 m) of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tedifice has fairly regular walls. The rear wall of this room is built into the upper slope to a depth of 1.1 m.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOne corbel on the forward wall of the rear room is in place. The stone roof must have been very adeptly\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconstructed in order to span this relatively large room. The 60-cm wide entrance to the rear room is in its east\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twall. The maximum height of the interior walls of the rear room is 1.7 m. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n"}]}
