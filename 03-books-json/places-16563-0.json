The trail that accessed the site from the east has disappeared with\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttime. The main complex (axis runs northwest-southeast for 27 m) is built on a rock spur that is only 2 m\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(southeast side) to 5 m (northwest) wide. This is hardly the setting for a Buddhist\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmonastery. The main complex contained around five buildings or rooms.
