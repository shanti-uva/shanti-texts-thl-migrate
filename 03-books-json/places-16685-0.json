The site is situated on a prominence overlooking the southern edge of a small plateau. The view east of <span class=\"popular\">Gyaplung Doring<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Rgyab lung rdo ring<\/span> is closely hemmed in by a ridge, an unusual geographic orientation for Upper Tibetan funerary sites. The terrain is moderately sloping and sandy. Although rocks are scattered around the proximity, there are no definite signs that the pillars of <span class=\"popular\">Doring Gyablung<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo ring rgyab lung<\/span> were enclosed. The quite severe gradient of the site is not in conformance with the customary topographical placement of this monument typology. The 11 in situ pillars of the site are gray to red color. The pillars, standing on high ground, overlook the five funerary enclosures of the site. The uncut menhirs are tilted at various angles, heavily worn and discolored. While the broad faces of the tabular specimens tend to face north and south, there are considerable variations (probably, at least in part, due to geomorphologic changes). <\/p> "},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":" <p>According to local sources, a primordial monument.<\/p> "},{"title":"Site elements","index":6,"parent_index":2,"body":" "},{"title":"Pillars","index":7,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p>From south to north, the pillars of <span class=\"popular\">Doring Gyablung<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo ring rgyab lung<\/span> have the following dimensions and forms:<\/p> <ol> <li>Long-stone DR1: tabular (90 cm [height] x 1 m [basal girth]).
