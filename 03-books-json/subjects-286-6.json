The basic difference is between a form of polite speech (<span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ཞེ་ས་</span>) and ordinary speech <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">(སྐད་དཀྱུས་མ་</span>). In polite speech, honorific expressions are used for the 2nd and 3rd persons, while humilific expressions are used for the 1st person. <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ཞེ་ས་ </span>is expressed mainly through personal pronouns, nouns, verbs and their auxiliaries.</p>
