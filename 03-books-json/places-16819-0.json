The views to the north and south are fairly\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\topen, while those to the east and west are constrained by ridges bounding the basin.

The site was\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcompletely altered by the construction of <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma &#7751;i </span>walls. In the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChinese Cultural Revolution, these <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma &#7751;i</span> walls were in turn\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdestroyed and now lie in two heaps. The mostly broken plaques are primarily inscribed with the <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma &#7751;i</span> mantra. These plaques are significantly worn and must be centuries old.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEvidently, the <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma &#7751;i</span> walls were built with stones extracted\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom local funerary structures. These Buddhist shrines are likely to have been constructed to rid the locale of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnegative influences thought to emanate from the funerary structures, or perhaps to make amends after their\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdesecration. Interestingly, despite its wholesale modification, <span class=\"popular\">Belmo M&ouml;ndur</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bal mo mon dur</span> never lost its <span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span> associations. The continued presence of the original structures has probably conspired to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thelp it retain its older cultural connotations. It appears that substantial funerary structures once stood at\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"popular\">Belmo M&ouml;ndur</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bal mo mon dur</span>.

These stones appear to have been transported\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom an adjacent rocky slope. The largest of the old <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma &#7751;i</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twalls now forms a pile about 4.5 m in length and 1.5 m in height. This pile of sacred rubble may obscure older\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twall traces. There is also a smaller pile of broken plaques and rubble, the remains of another <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma &#7751;i</span> wall. A double-course wall fragment (5 m long, 65 cm thick) from a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfunerary structure is situated to the west of the <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma &#7751;i</span> wall\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trubble. The blocks in this east-west running wall are flush with the ground level. On either side of this\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstructure there are concavities in the ground, the probable vestiges of two funerary enclosures or cells. The long\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmasonry fragment appears to have been part of a wall common to both cells. The depression on the north side of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthis east-west oriented wall fragment is surrounded by other wall traces. These structural remains once formed a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tquadrate enclosure, approximately 3.7 m in length (east-west). No traces of walls remain around the south\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdepression as well. Wall vestiges are also found north of the <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t&#7751;i</span> rubble, and there is a wall fragment (2.5 m long) to the east.

On this ridge\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthere is a distinctive line of stones that runs between two spurs (31&deg; 45.4&#900; N. lat. / 84&deg; 05.8&#900; E. long. / 4730\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tm). This sinuous stone structure is nearly 100 m in length and is located about 20 m above the valley floor. It\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\truns in a northeast-southwest direction and is possibly a natural geological feature. A sloping terrace, 3 m to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t10 m wide, forms behind this rock structure. A little farther up valley there are the remains of a manmade stone\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twall, which circumscribes the base of the southern ridge. This wall is around 200 m in length and 20 cm to 40 cm\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin height. In between these two linear stone structures is a third example bounding a terrace about 30 m above\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe valley floor. There are several dozen small stone mounds dispersed around the rocky valley bottom just north\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the 200-m long wall. These mounds are 1 m to 2 m in diameter and 20 cm to 30 cm in height. They are impacted\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twith soil and have moss growing on them, indicating that they have stood undisturbed for quite awhile. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmounds and the adjoining stone walls appear to have a funerary function. This is the only site of this\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tparticular morphological configuration surveyed to date. According to the local elder, <span class=\"popular\">Ng&uuml;lchu Y&ouml;ntan</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dngul chu yon tan</span> (Ox Year, born circa 1937), these\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twalls and mounds are associated with the ancient <span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span>. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n"}]}
