Tiny traces of its south wall run for nearly 5 m,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbeginning just east of the pillar. The few extant metamorphic (?) stones are around 20 cm in length and are\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlevel with the ground surface. These stones are uncut and blocky. There are also a few in situ stones comprising\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ta 1-m long segment of the north wall. These two wall segments appear to be oriented east-west, suggesting that\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe entire enclosure was aligned in the cardinal directions. The distance between the north wall and south wall\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfragments is 3.8 m, indicating that this was a smaller example of this enclosure type. There is a double-course\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tslab wall 4.2 m in length situated 6.2 m east of the pillar. This slab wall appears to be quite well centered\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbetween the north and south walls of the enclosure. Its relative position indicates that it constituted an\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinterior structural feature of the enclosure. The slab wall is generally oriented east-west, but its course is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnot perfectly straight. Slabs (10 cm to 30 cm long) inserted into the ground edgewise make up the wall. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tslabs project a maximum of 5 cm above the ground surface. Two different types of rock were selected for use as\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tslabs. Some loose stones are scattered in and around the enclosure. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Pillar","index":8,"parent_index":6,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The single pillar appears to stand near what was once the west wall of the enclosure.
