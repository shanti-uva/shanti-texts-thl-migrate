The summit is connected to the range bounding the east side of the valley, but it is not\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tapproachable from this direction. Other approaches also present vertical expanses, thus the site is endowed\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twith a good defensive aspect. The east sector summit is now only 2 m to 4 m wide, but a significant portion of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tit appears to have slipped down the sides of the formation. There is much rubble lying on the surface. At the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\teastern extremity of the east sector there is a random-work cobble wall segment precariously attached to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tformation. None of it still stands independently above the summit. This wall segment is 1.3 m in length and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1.5 m high. Also on this narrow east end of the hilltop (1.5 m below the top) there is a 2-m long wall segment\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcomposed of cobbles and sandstone blocks (10 cm to 20 cm long). On the west end of the east sector there is a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcobble and adobe-block wall 2 m in length and 2.5 m in height. It tenuously rests above the south rim of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsummit.

Embedded in various parts of the summit are small pieces of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdouble-course cobble footings (40 cm to 50 cm thick). This part of the summit also has cobble disjecta membra\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tscattered all around it. Many other old building stones are likely to have fallen off the summit over the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcourse of time. The structural remains seem to indicate that edifices once stood on the west sector summit,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbut their design and extent are not at all determinable. On the east end of the west sector, at the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsouthernmost extension of the formation, there is a lone wall segment 1.5 m in length and up to 2.3 m in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\theight.

The presence of two wall\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsegments more than 2 m in height at <span class=\"popular\">Lung Puk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Lung phug</span> is an indication that significant structures were once established here.

This tunnel opens to a narrow ledge that gains access to another tunnel bored deep into\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe hillside.
