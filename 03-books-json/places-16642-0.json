The cave is well hidden from the <span class=\"popular\">Tritso Tsangpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Khri tsho gtsang po</span>, a relatively low elevation valley with rich pasturelands. This residence was\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twell sheltered from the elements and perhaps from enemies as well. <span class=\"popular\">Do Puk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo phug</span> has a southern exposure making it especially attractive for habitation. There is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmuch rubble in the mouth of the cave and the traces of various masonry structures inside.

The cave is 8 m to 12 m wide and has a ceiling more than 3 m in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\theight. The structural remains suggest that this cave once accommodated a fairly large group of residents.

Each of these wall traces is at a slightly higher elevation (the floor of the cave angles upward from the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tentrance).

Stones up to 35 cm in length and large amounts of a clay-based mortar were used in its construction. This\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tenigmatic structure resembles a partition wall but may actually have had a ceremonial function. In the rear of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"popular\">Do Puk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo phug</span>, on its east side, there is a ledge (4\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tm long, about 2 m wide) suspended above the cave floor. The west and east sides of this ledge are bounded by walls\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(1.2 m and 1.3 m long) that are only one vertical course of stones in height. Adjacent to the east side of this\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tledge there is another ledge that is about 3 m in width. On the forward/south side of the east ledge there are the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tremains of a wall (3.5 m long, up to 60 cm high), composed of stones up to 50 cm in length.
