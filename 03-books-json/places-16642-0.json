Each of these wall traces is at a slightly higher elevation (the floor of the cave angles upward from the entrance). These high dissolute remains must have been part of significant forward structures that barricaded the entrance to <span class=\"popular\">Do Puk<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo phug<\/span>. In the middle of the rear of the cave there is a masonry structure (1.1 m long, 1.2 m high) set on a rock outcrop below a low point in the ceiling. Stones up to 35 cm in length and large amounts of a clay-based mortar were used in its construction. This enigmatic structure resembles a partition wall but may actually have had a ceremonial function. In the rear of <span class=\"popular\">Do Puk<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo phug<\/span>, on its east side, there is a ledge (4 m long, about 2 m wide) suspended above the cave floor. The west and east sides of this ledge are bounded by walls (1.2 m and 1.3 m long) that are only one vertical course of stones in height. Adjacent to the east side of this ledge there is another ledge that is about 3 m in width. On the forward\/south side of the east ledge there are the remains of a wall (3.5 m long, up to 60 cm high), composed of stones up to 50 cm in length. It is not known whether these walled ledges had a utilitarian or ceremonial function. On the west side of the middle portion of <span class=\"popular\">Do Puk<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo phug<\/span> there appears to be an extremely degraded structure (6 m x 3.5 m) now reduced to a shallow covering of stones.<\/p>  "}]}
