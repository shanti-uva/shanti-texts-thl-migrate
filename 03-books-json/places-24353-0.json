A Horse and Tea Trading Station (Chama si 茶马司 ) was set up near here (in the Tiebu Valley, south of <span class=\"place\" title=\"f1141\">Choné</span>) in 1404 to trade with the 18 clans of the <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Tebo</span> (<em><span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">the bo</span></em>) Tibetans.

<p>According to the leader of <span class=\"place\" title=\"F1141\">Choné</span> in 1925, his family had moved to the area and taken possession of it in 1404, whereupon they informed the Ming Emperor Yongle of this fact and were recognized as local rulers, and were given a seal of authority and the surname Yang. <a name=\"n7\" href=\"#fn7\">[7]</a> Most sources agree that the family moved into the area in 1404, but all written sources agree that recognition did not come until 1418 and that the family's power endured for twenty generations until 1949.</p>

   "body": "<p>This polity was ruled by joint religious and political rule, with the elder son taking the role of king and the younger son becoming the head lama. If there was only one son, he would hold both positions. By the Qing period, the family intermarried with the female offspring of the local ruling Mongol khans, the Khoshut Qinwang.<a name=\"n10\" href=\"#fn10\">[10]</a> In modern times, the king's territory seems to have been limited by the growth of Labrang (bla brang) Monastery's influence. The king's seat of power was also named <span class=\"place\" title=\"F1141\">Choné</span>, and in 1925 it was a village of about 400 families (2,000 individuals) with few Chinese inhabitants.<a name=\"n11\" href=\"#fn11\">[11]</a></p>
<p>The main monastery at <span class=\"place\" title=\"F1141\">Choné</span> is called <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Choné Gönchen Ganden Shedrupling</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">co ne dgon chen dga' ldan bshad sgrub gling</span></em>) or <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Tingdzin Dargyeling</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">ting 'dzin dar rgyas gling</span></em>, Ch. Chanding si), and during the early 15<sup>th</sup> century boasted some 3,800 monks, though this number had dwindled to a (still substantial) 700 by 1925. The monastery also received support from the Qing emperors, such as the Kangxi emperor.<a name=\"n12\" href=\"#fn12\">[12]</a> The ruling family also took advantage of its connections with the Qing emperors to gain a great deal of power in Central Tibet, where one of the four regent incarnations, who essentially ruled Tibet between 1777 and 1895, was consistently drawn from these loyal subjects of the Qing empire. The first <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Tsomönling</span> (<em><span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">mtsho smon gling</span></em>/ <em><span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">tshe mon gling</span></em>) incarnation <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Ngawang Tsültrim</span> (<em><span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">ngag dbang tsul 'khrims</span></em>, 1721-1791, r. 1777-1781) was from <span class=\"place\" title=\"F1141\">Choné</span>. He became imperial preceptor (<em>dishi</em>) to the Qianlong emperor in 1762, and served as abbot of Yonghegong Monastery in Beijing. He was appointed regent (<span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">gyeltsap</span>, <em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">rgyal tshab</span></em>) for the 8<sup>th</sup> Dalai Lama, and received the title Erdeni Nomun Khan in 1777, a position he held until 1781.<a name=\"n13\" href=\"#fn13\">[13]</a> He became the 61<sup>st </sup> <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Ganden Tripa</span> (<em><span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">dga' ldan khri pa</span></em>) in 1778 and had close connections to <span class=\"place\" title=\"F433\">Sera</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"F433\">se ra</span></em>) Monastery. He was reappointed regent of Tibet in 1790, but died the next year after serving in this position for only four months. The second <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Tsomönling</span> <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Ngawang Jampel Tsültrim</span> (<em><span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">ngag dbang 'jam dpal tsul khrims</span></em>, 1792-1862/1864)<a name=\"n14\" href=\"#fn14\">[14]</a> was also from <span class=\"place\" title=\"F1141\">Choné</span>, from the <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Ga</span> clan (Yang <em>tusi</em>) ruling family. He was best known by his Mongol name, Galdan Shiregetu Samati Bakshi. He became the regent for the 10<sup>th</sup> Dalai Lama in 1819. He has been called \"by far the most forceful character  in 19<sup>th</sup>-century Tibet.\"<a name=\"n15\" href=\"#fn15\">[15]</a> He held this position for a quarter of a century, though he was away in Beijing in 1829, where he was honored by the Taoguang emperor with the privilege of being able to remain mounted on horseback within the Forbidden City. In 1837, when he became the 73<sup>rd</sup> <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Ganden Tripa</span>, he was apparently also put in charge of all Tibetan affairs.<a name=\"n16\" href=\"#fn16\">[16]</a> In 1844, with the support of the rival regent lamas, who had been denied power for too long, he was impeached by the Amban Qishan. His supporters among the <span class=\"place\" title=\"F433\">Sera</span> monks freed him, but he submitted to the Qing orders, was banished to Manchuria for some time, and died at <span class=\"place\" title=\"F1141\">Choné</span>.<a name=\"n17\" href=\"#fn17\">[17]</a> The third incarnation <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Ngawang Lozang Tenpai Gyeltsen</span> (<em><span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">ngag dbang blo bzang bstan pa'i rgyal mtshan</span></em>, 1844-1919) must have been recognized shortly after his predecessor was impeached and removed from his position. He also played an important role in Central Tibetan politics. He was the 87<sup>th</sup> <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Ganden Tripa</span> from 1907-1914, which left him to take the reigns of power as the <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">sikyong letsap</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">srid skyong las tshab</span></em>) while the 13<sup>th</sup> Dalai Lama was in exile in India.<a name=\"n18\" href=\"#fn18\">[18]</a></p>
