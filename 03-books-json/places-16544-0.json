Below the sheer walls of the summit are structural vestiges that resemble ramparts. On the lower or west end of he ridge-crest there is a 15-m long bluff in which masonry and adobe blocks are embedded. These wall remnants are up to 4 m in height. The masonry walls exhibit a texture of alternating courses of stone blocks and cobbles (up to 50 cm in length). The presence of these tall well-designed structures may suggest that significant buildings once stood here. Below the bluff there is a ridge-prow (23 m x 21 m) that hosts highly obscured traces of wall-footings. These also appear to have been building foundations of some kind.<\/p> "},{"title":"Lower Site","index":8,"parent_index":6,"body":null},{"title":"Affiliated sites","index":9,"parent_index":2,"body":" "},{"title":"mdo gsham mug mkhar dgon","index":10,"parent_index":9,"body":null}]}
