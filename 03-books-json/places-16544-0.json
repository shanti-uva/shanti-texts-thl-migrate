The presence of these tall well-designed structures may suggest that significant\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbuildings once stood here.

It appears that much of the detritus of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\toriginal structures was exploited to make the large wall that now dominates the site. This wall, built before\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tliving memory, has the design characteristics of a <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma &#7751;i</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twall, but no inscribed plaques are found on it. It may have been constructed to subdue the inauspicious\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(non-Buddhist) aura of the site and to modify its archaic architectural character. Perhaps\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe resources to furnish it with religious plaques were never realized.

In the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmiddle of the site there is yet another in situ wall, built into the edge of a 4-m high bluff.

Further\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdownstream, where the <span class=\"popular\">Dosham</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mdo gsham</span> valley enters a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdefile, there are the remains of the impressive Buddhist monastic complex of <span class=\"popular\">Dosham Mukkhar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mdo gsham mug mkhar</span>. This sprawling installation\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tclearly indicates that a much larger population once inhabited the valley. It is said to have received its name\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom the many pigeons found here (in the <span class=\"popular\">Ngari</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mnga&rsquo; ris</span> dialect <span class=\"popular emph\">mukgu</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mug gu </span>means pigeon). Situated on\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe right or east side of the valley, large mud-brick and rammed-earth buildings line the summit and sides of a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlarge formation. The mesa-like formation blanketed in ruins is reminiscent of nearby <span class=\"popular\">Tsarang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rtsa rang</span> (A-62), although <span class=\"popular\">Dosham Mukkhar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mdo gsham mug mkhar</span> is somewhat smaller. It is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsaid that a functioning monastery, a branch facility of <span class=\"popular\">Toding</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mtho lding</span>, existed at the site until the Chinese Cultural Revolution. Only one <span class=\"popular emph\">Ch&ouml;rten</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mchod rten</span> in <span class=\"popular\">Khadampa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Kha dam pa</span> style is still maintained at <span class=\"popular\">Dosham Mukkhar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mdo gsham mug mkhar</span>. Interestingly, local villagers also refer to the summit\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcomplex as <span class=\"popular\">Mukhar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Smu mkhar</span>; <span class=\"popular emph\">mu</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">smu</span> being a kind of mythical monster of ancient times. The <span class=\"popular emph\">mu</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">smu</span> is widely encountered in the mythology of <span class=\"popular\">Gug&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ge lho smad</span>. This myth may preserve a historical memory of the archaic\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\toccupation of the <span class=\"popular\">Dosham Mukkhar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mdo gsham mug mkhar</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsite. This view is given weight by the fact that the site, with its extensive summit and strategic position\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tabove a defile, is probably the most desirable spot for habitation in the <span class=\"popular\">Dosham</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mdo gsham</span> valley. We must, therefore, consider the possibility that, in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tarchaic cultural horizon, the two so-called <span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span> sites of the valley (A-110, A-111) were subsidiary to this location in terms of population and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcultural significance. In keeping with this hypothesis, it would appear that the two minor &lsquo;<span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span>&rsquo; sites were not the object of Buddhist\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tresettlement, while the chief archaic site of <span class=\"popular\">Dosham</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mdo gsham</span> was thoroughly redeveloped. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n"}]}
