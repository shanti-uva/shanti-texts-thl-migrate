   "body": "<p>This categories covers events that pertain to the creation, alteration, renovation, decline,  destruction or other significant events of specific structures like bridges, single buildings like a temple, groups of buildings, a complex organizations like a monastery,  a human settlement like a village or monastery, or an abstract administrative creation like a county. This also covers clans, religious lineages, and other such corporate entities.</p>
<p>Obviously there are category differences here between a discrete physical item like a bridge - its building, repair, destruction, rebuilding, and so forth - and a more abstract entity like monastic corporation or a province, and even more so a clan. We have tried in the subcategories to use flexible nomenclature  that can cover the full spectrum. One reason is that organizations and buildings often go hand in hand - the beginning of a monastery is generally identified with the building of an initial set of physical structures. Another reason is that by using the same categories for the full spectrum, it is easy to see the coincidence of like events - what types of things are created, for example, in a given time period?</p>
