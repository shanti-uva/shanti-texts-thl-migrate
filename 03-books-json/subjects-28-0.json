   "body": "<p>A \"principality,\" in contrast to the independence of a kingdom, is a polity that is partially subordinated to a larger political entity, such as an Empire, whether or not they use the nomenclature of \"kingdoms\" (<span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">rgyal khab</span>), or refer to their political leaders as \"king\" (<span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">rgyal po</span>). However, such subordination can take many shapes, ranging from limited and largely contractual subordination, to more pervasive forms.</p>
<p>Examples include Degé, Choné, Muli, Gartok, and the Gyelrong states, since they were subordinated, at least at times and in some ways, to the Qing Empire (or Ganden Podrang in the case of Gartok).</p>
