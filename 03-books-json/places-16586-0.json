This all-stone corbelled structure probably contained around eight rooms, and measures 5.3 m (east-west) x 11 m (north-south). The rear or north side of the building has been heavily damaged by the construction of a now abandoned 7-m long corral. Despite there being roofing sections partially intact, <span class=\"popular\">Chilbu Gönpa<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Spyil bu dgon pa<\/span> is highly deteriorated, precluding a detailed assessment of its ground plan. The walls are made of random-work composed of variable-sized stones (mostly slabs, 10 cm to 70 cm in length). A light-colored clay-based mortar was used, most of which has leached out from the walls. Corbels and bridging stones up to 1.9 m in length are scattered about the site. <\/p> "},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":" <p>A tale circulates in the region concerning <span class=\"popular\">Chilbu Gönpa<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Spyil bu dgon pa<\/span>: It was the residence of a lama named <span class=\"popular\">Drülgyel<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Sbrul rgyal<\/span> (Serpent King). This lama was a heavy beer (<span class=\"popular emph\">chang<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">chang<\/span>) drinker. He owned a magical <span class=\"popular emph\">chang<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">chang<\/span> container that always met his needs. <span class=\"popular\">Drülgyel<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Sbrul rgyal<\/span> had a woman servant named <span class=\"popular\">Jomo<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Jo mo<\/span> (mistress\/elder sister; the mountain <span class=\"popular\">Jomo Rirang<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Jo mo ri rang<\/span> is supposed to have been named after her). <span class=\"popular\">Drülgyel<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Sbrul rgyal<\/span> gave her strict orders never to open the <span class=\"popular emph\">chang<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">chang<\/span> container. One day <span class=\"popular\">Jomo<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Jo mo<\/span> was overcome with curiosity; she wanted to know why the container provided the lama with an inexhaustible supply of <span class=\"popular emph\">chang<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">chang<\/span>. After much hesitation, she opened the <span class=\"popular emph\">chang<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">chang<\/span> container and a serpent jumped out and slithered away to <span class=\"popular\">Purang<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Spu rang<\/span>, a land with much beer. The escape of the wealth-bestowing snake caused <span class=\"popular\">Drülgyel<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Sbrul rgyal<\/span>’s <span class=\"popular emph\">chang<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">chang<\/span> supply to run dry. That night because of her disobedience <span class=\"popular\">Jomo Gyel<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Jo mo rgyal<\/span> died and was turned into a walking corpse (<span class=\"popular emph\">rolang<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ro lang<\/span>). By touching <span class=\"popular\">Drülgyel<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Sbrul rgyal<\/span> and his disciples while they slept, they also became walking corpses. <span class=\"popular\">Chilbu Gönpa<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Spyil bu dgon pa<\/span> is said to be still haunted by these ghosts and to be a dangerous place as a result. Although the characters and happenings in his tale do not seem very Buddhist-like, paleographic evidence indicates that in the early historic period this facility was in Buddhist hands. This is corroborated by <span class=\"popular\">Khechok Dorjé<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Mkhas mchog rdo rje<\/span> (born in the Iron Dog Year, circa 1934) of <span class=\"popular\">Tsada<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Rtsa mda’<\/span>, an individual knowledgeable in Bon history (he was a student of <span class=\"popular\">Kyungtrül Rinpoché<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Khyung sprul rin po che<\/span> in <span class=\"popular\">Ngari<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Mnga’ ris<\/span> for one year). He reports that the lama of <span class=\"popular\">Chilbu Gönpa<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Spyil bu dgon pa<\/span> was named <span class=\"popular\">Trülchang<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Sbrul chang<\/span>, a <span class=\"popular emph\">nyingmapa<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rnying ma pa<\/span> who attracted many disciples around him. mkhas pa rdo rje adds that <span class=\"popular\">Trülchang<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Sbrul chang<\/span> was born in <span class=\"popular\">Kham<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Khams<\/span> a very long time ago. <\/p> <p>The present incarnate lama of <span class=\"popular\">Dunchu<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Mdun chu<\/span> monastery reports that the first <span class=\"popular emph\">Drugpa Kagyü<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">’brug pa bka’ brgyud<\/span> lama of <span class=\"popular\">Dunchu<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Mdun chu<\/span> also spent time at <span class=\"popular\">Jomo Rirang<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Jo mo ri rang<\/span>. The <span class=\"popular\">Dunchu<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Mdun chu<\/span> lama adds that in the time of the Fifth Dalai Lama, <span class=\"popular\">Dunchu<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Mdun chu<\/span> was converted into a <span class=\"popular emph\">gelukpa<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">dge lugs pa<\/span> institution. <\/p> "},{"title":"Site elements","index":6,"parent_index":2,"body":" "},{"title":"gSas khang","index":7,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p>On the east side of the single structure some bridging stones and roof slabs are in situ, but the rooms underneath them have been largely filled with rubble. At 2 m, the southeast corner of the edifice is the highest elevation portion of the edifice remaining. In the south wall there is a 90-cm high opening overlaid with stone beams, which may have once been an entranceway but it is now partially obstructed by rubble. There is also an entrance in the southwest extremity of the structure (1.1 m x 45 cm). <\/p> "},{"title":"ma Ni stones","index":8,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p>The carved <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma ṇi<\/span> plaques found at the site document two distinctive periods of Buddhist occupation. The presence of these two styles of plaques confirms that the site has had a very long Buddhist tenure. The oldest plaques, which number 34, have <span class=\"popular emph\">Wuchen<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">dbu can<\/span> lettering directly engraved into the stones, while the later plaques are made by removing the layer of stone surrounding the letters to create a relief carving. In the highly worn early plaques the letters are quite crudely executed and have a calligraphic form known from early historic period inscriptions and texts: elementary and rather stilted. All but two of the early plaques were made from a dark-colored stone. These older plaques rest on what appears to be the original shrine wall (8.5 m long, 50 cm thick and around 85 cm in height). This masonry wall is aligned in a north-south direction. Much of the southern extremity of this clay-mortared wall has collapsed. In Upper Tibet, it is highly unusual to discover inscribed plaques of sufficient age to have been carved during the first Buddhist diffusion (<span class=\"popular emph\">tenpa ngadar<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">bstan pa snga dar<\/span>). <\/p> <p>Immediately north of the early <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma ṇi<\/span> wall there is a rectangular shrine (1.5 m x 1.5 m x 1.7 m), which is aligned in the cardinal directions. A few <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma ṇi<\/span> stones rest upon the flat top of this <span class=\"popular emph\">tenkhar<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rten mkhar<\/span> type shrine. This ceremonial structure is entirely made of random-rubble. On its south side there is a 90-cm deep hollow (35 cm x 45 cm), which must have been used to enshrine sacred materials or phenomena. The top of the shrine is comprised of dark-colored stone beams like hose found at the other archaeological sites of <span class=\"popular\">Jomo Rirang<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Jo mo ri rang<\/span> (A-54, B-23). The walls of <span class=\"popular\">Chilbu Gönpa<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Spyil bu dgon pa<\/span> begin 3.8 m north of this shrine. The later period <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma ṇi<\/span> stones are concentrated on their own rudimentary wall some distance away from the edifice. <\/p>  "}]}
