This lama was a heavy beer (<span class=\"popular emph\">chang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">chang</span>)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdrinker. He owned a magical <span class=\"popular emph\">chang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">chang</span> container that always met his needs. <span class=\"popular\">Dr&uuml;lgyel</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sbrul rgyal</span> had a woman servant named <span class=\"popular\">Jomo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Jo mo</span> (mistress/elder sister; the mountain <span class=\"popular\">Jomo Rirang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Jo mo ri rang</span> is supposed to have been named after\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ther). <span class=\"popular\">Dr&uuml;lgyel</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sbrul rgyal</span> gave her strict orders never to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\topen the <span class=\"popular emph\">chang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">chang</span> container. One day <span class=\"popular\">Jomo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Jo mo</span> was overcome with curiosity; she wanted to know why the container provided the lama\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twith an inexhaustible supply of <span class=\"popular emph\">chang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">chang</span>. After much hesitation, she opened the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"popular emph\">chang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">chang</span> container and a serpent jumped out and slithered away to <span class=\"popular\">Purang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Spu rang</span>, a land with much beer. The escape of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twealth-bestowing snake caused <span class=\"popular\">Dr&uuml;lgyel</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sbrul rgyal</span>&rsquo;s <span class=\"popular emph\">chang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">chang</span> supply to run dry. That night because of her disobedience <span class=\"popular\">Jomo Gyel</span><span class=\"scholar\">Jo mo rgyal</span> died and was turned into a walking corpse\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(<span class=\"popular emph\">rolang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ro lang</span>). By touching <span class=\"popular\">Dr&uuml;lgyel</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sbrul rgyal</span> and his disciples while they slept, they also became walking\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcorpses. <span class=\"popular\">Chilbu G&ouml;npa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Spyil bu dgon pa</span> is said to be\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstill haunted by these ghosts and to be a dangerous place as a result. Although the characters and happenings in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthis tale do not seem very Buddhist-like, paleographic evidence indicates that in the early\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thistoric period this facility was in Buddhist hands.

The presence of these two styles of plaques\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconfirms that the site has had a very long Buddhist tenure. The oldest plaques, which number\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t34, have <span class=\"popular emph\">Wuchen</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">dbu can</span> lettering directly engraved into the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstones, while the later plaques are made by removing the layer of stone surrounding the letters to create a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trelief carving. In the highly worn early plaques the letters are quite crudely executed and have a calligraphic\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tform known from early historic period inscriptions and texts: elementary and rather stilted. All but two of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tearly plaques were made from a dark-colored stone. These older plaques rest on what appears to be the original\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tshrine wall (8.5 m long, 50 cm thick and around 85 cm in height). This masonry wall is aligned in a north-south\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdirection. Much of the southern extremity of this clay-mortared wall has collapsed. In Upper Tibet, it is highly unusual to discover inscribed plaques of sufficient age to have been\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcarved during the first Buddhist diffusion (<span class=\"popular emph\">tenpa ngadar</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">bstan pa snga dar</span>). </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Immediately north of the early <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma &#7751;i</span> wall there is a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trectangular shrine (1.5 m x 1.5 m x 1.7 m), which is aligned in the cardinal directions. A few <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma &#7751;i</span> stones rest upon the flat top of this <span class=\"popular emph\">tenkhar</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rten mkhar</span> type shrine. This ceremonial structure is entirely made of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trandom-rubble. On its south side there is a 90-cm deep hollow (35 cm x 45 cm), which must have been used to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tenshrine sacred materials or phenomena. The top of the shrine is comprised of dark-colored stone beams like\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthose found at the other archaeological sites of <span class=\"popular\">Jomo Rirang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Jo mo ri rang</span> (A-54, B-23).
