The walls were built with a limestone random-rubble\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttexture and are 50 cm to 70 cm in thickness. Variable-sized stones went into the construction of the walls. Many\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the standing structures are found on a large rock ledge and the steeply inclined slopes that extend below it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the contemporary period, the nearest permanent water source is located in the <span class=\"popular\">Darlung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dar lung</span> valley, approximately 1 km away.
