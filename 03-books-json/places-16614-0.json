A wall fragment (3.6 m in length) of this structure, which runs perpendicular to the escarpment, is covered in a red ochre-tinted mud veneer. This masonry fragment is a maximum of 2.8 m in height and is surmounted by a tiered structure (85 cm in height) reminiscent of the <span class=\"popular emph\">lhaten<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">lha rten<\/span>, <span class=\"popular emph\">lhatsug<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">lha gtsug<\/span> or <span class=\"popular emph\">tenkhar<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rten mkhar<\/span> class shrines. Painted white, this structure has a square pedestal (35 cm in height) topped by four graduated square tiers, which are capped by a rounded upper ier. These five tiers have a total height of 50 cm. This stepped structure must have once been suspended above he forward portion of the freestanding building, perhaps flanking its entrance as a ritual protective device. This building enclosed a narrow cave 19 m deep. On the walls of this cave are six smallish red ochre counterclockwise swastikas, documenting the Bon occupation of the site. There are two swastikas on the right wall, three on the left wall and one near the mouth of the cave. Also on the right wall are two faint red ochre spoked-circles and an incomplete letter <span class=\"popular emph\">a<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">a<\/span>.<a href=\"#n92\" name=\"nb92\" class=\"note\">92<\/a> The circle that is most distinguishable has eight spokes. <\/p> "},{"title":"Other freestanding structures","index":10,"parent_index":7,"body":null},{"title":"Notes","index":11,"parent_index":0,"body":null}]}
