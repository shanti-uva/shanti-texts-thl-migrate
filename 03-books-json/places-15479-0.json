The <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dhitsa Nangso</span>'s territory began in what is now western <span class=\"place\" title=\"F1159\">Bayen</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"F1159\">ba yan</span></em>, Ch. Hualong) County, from <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15479\">Dhitsa</span> (Ch. Zhizha) Township to <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Alaka</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">a la ka</span></em>) Village and from Shalagou (a gorge on the Yellow River) to the Zhima’ang area (Tib. <em><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">brag dmar sa kul</span></em>) in eastern <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Trikha</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">khri kha</span></em>, Ch. Guide) County. He was known as the <em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">nangso</span></em> of the Shang shi zu (Tib. <em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">stod kyi tsho bcu</span></em>, ten upper clans), including Diezha, Angsiduo, Duoba, Sherenbu ju, Andachiha, Sina jia, Kazangongwa, Heichengzi jia he, Qun jia, and Shuinaihai. Under the <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dhitsa Nangso</span>, there were several local <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">pönpo</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">dpon po</span>,</em> chiefs) such as Yu long <em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">pönpo</span></em>, Lang long <em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">pönpo</span></em>, Qu jia <em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">pönpo</span></em>, and Cai rou <em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">pönpo</span></em>. All these leaders had their official hat and seal. The size of the coral on their hat indicated their status—the bigger the coral, the more powerful the leader.</p><p>The <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dhitsa Nangso</span> taxed his people and charged fees for settling disputes such as field disputes and marriage problems. He lived in a large lavish residence made up of three compounds with three different styles of structures. </p><p>According to this source, the Tibetan term <em>nangso</em> (transcribed in Chinese as <em>angsuo</em>) originally referred to people scouting along or patrolling the borders (literally, “internal spy”). However, gradually <em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">nangso</span></em> took on a new meaning and it referred to the officials managing both the military and people. Like <em>qianhu</em> (Tib. <em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">khri dpon</span></em>) and <em>baihu </em>(Tib. <em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">rgya dpon</span></em>), <em>angsuo</em> is an official title, but it indicated a more powerful position because such leaders were endowed with both military and religious power. In Qinghai, as an official title <em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">nangso</span> </em>appeared in the Yuan Dynasty, and the <em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">nangso</span></em>’s role was a manager under a major incarnate lama. But in the Ming Dynasty, the <em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">nangso</span></em> was a religious and temporal leader.</p>",
