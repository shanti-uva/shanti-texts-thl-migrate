The vistas to the north and east are particularly wide open. The shelf declines in an eastern direction, forcing the downhill walls of the heaped-stone wall enclosures to be elevated in order to maintain level interiors. The walls of these rounded enclosures consist of stones heaped to a height of 60 cm. The heaped-stone walls are as much as 1 m to 2 m thick, reflecting a great deal of subsidence over the centuries. Stones are strewn around the site while adjoining areas of the same shelf are free of such debris. This probably indicates that these loose stones were once part of the superstructures.

The structures are made from variable-length (20 cm to 1 m long) stones. These stones are light-colored with a dark grain and have acquired a reddish varnish. There is a small corral on the site which was probably built with stones pilfered from the monuments. <\/p>"},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":"<p> <span class=\"popular\">Rirung M\u00f6ndur<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Ri rung mon dur<\/span> is attributed by local sources to the ancient <span class=\"popular\">M\u00f6n<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon<\/span>.<\/p>"},{"title":"Site elements","index":6,"parent_index":2,"body":"<p>From south to north, the characteristics of the three superstructures are as follows:<\/p><ol> <li>Funerary structure FS1 (19 m long) is kidney shaped and has a level interior.
