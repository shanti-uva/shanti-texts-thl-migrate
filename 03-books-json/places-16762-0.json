The uphill wall is sunken about 60 cm into the ground and the downhill wall is raised a like amount in order to create a level interior. The interior is free from visible structural elements.<\/li> <li>Funerary structure FS2 (6 m long) is located 17 m northwest of FS1. This is an irregularly shaped enclosure with single-course perimeter walls. The stones in the enclosure are up to 90 cm in length and project as much as 35 cm from the surface of the ground.<\/li> <li>Funerary structure FS3 (17 m across) is situated 7 m northwest of FS2. This heaped-stone wall enclosure is nearly round. Like FS1, its uphill wall is set prominently into the ground, while its downhill wall is elevated in order to create a level interior. The interior is free from visible structural elements.<\/li> <li>Funerary structure FS4 (19 m across) is located 32 m northwest of FS3. This ovoid heaped-stone wall specimen may have been divided into two cells by a heaped-stone wall. <\/li> <\/ol>  "}]}
