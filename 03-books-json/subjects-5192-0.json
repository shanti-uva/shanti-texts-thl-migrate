For several years now, a team of translators in Varanasi (Benares) has been working on the reproduction of Sanskrit works from Tibetan versions.</p>\n<p class=\"Paragraph\">Over the course of time, Tibetan, like any other language, has enriched its vocabulary through lexical borrowings. The main sources have been Sanskrit, Mongolian, Uighur, and Ancient Chinese, with more recent recourse to English, Hindi, and Modern Chinese (<em>pu tong hua</em>).<a href=\"#_ftn1\">[1]</a> It is likely that other languages such as Zhangzhung (the region of which later became the kingdom of Guge), Tangut (<span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">མི་ཉག་</span>), and other Himalayan languages such as Kinnauri also contributed to Tibetan vocabulary.</p>\n<p class=\"Paragraph\">Whatever the case, it is a striking fact that Tibetan actually contains very few pure loans (also called &ldquo;transfers&rdquo;),<a href=\"#_ftn2\">[2]</a> and has tended to prefer calques (loan translations). This process consists of coining neologisms using Tibetan roots conveying the semantic content of compound words from other languages, such as Sanskrit, Chinese, and so on. The vocabulary that has been borrowed extends almost exclusively to <em>nouns, </em>and includes almost no verbs or adjectives.</p>\n<p class=\"Paragraph\">Unlike the majority of other literary Asian languages (Chinese, Japanese, Thai, Burmese, etc.), Tibetan has calqued or translated, rather than borrowed, the essential vocabulary of Buddhism. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Buddha = <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">སངས་རྒྱས་</span></li>\n<li>Bodhisattva = <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">བྱང་ཆུབ་སེམས་དཔའ་</span></li>\n<li>Karma = <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ལས་</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"Paragraph\">Even the names of Hindu divinities have been &ldquo;translated&rdquo;:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Indra = <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">བརྒྱ་བྱིན་</span></li>\n<li>Brahmā = <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ཚངས་པ་</span></li>\n<li>Śiva = <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">དབང་ཕྱུག་</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"Paragraph\">The Tibetan translators sometimes preferred to calque glosses or definitions of certain words, rather than the words themselves (see below). I refer to this type of loan as an <em>indirect calque</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"Paragraph\">Following are some examples of transfers, calques, and mixed forms.</p>\n<hr size=\"1\" />\n<p><a href=\"#_ftnref1\">[1]</a> For further details see Stephan Beyer, <em>The Classical Tibetan Language</em> (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1992), 138-145.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#_ftnref2\">[2]</a> Beyer defines &ldquo;transfer&rdquo; in <em>The Classical Tibetan Language</em>, (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1992), 139: &ldquo;One type of borrowing is the process we will call transfer, whereby a foreign word or phrase is simply incorporated wholesale into the lexicon, with more or less adaptation to native phonology and orthography.&rdquo; Transfers are rare in Tibetan, except in technical domains such as medicine, which contain a relatively larger proportion of Sanskrit and Chinese words.</p>","title":""}]}
