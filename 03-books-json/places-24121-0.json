The ruling family of Shitsang and the majority of people in Shitsang originally came from the Sakya (sa skya) area in Tsang (gtsang) during the reign of Drog\u00f6n Pakpa (\u2019gro mgon \u2019phags pa, 1235-1280). The first ruler of Shitsang was Tsangwa Namlhabum (gtsang ba gnam lha \u2019bum) and he was sent to protect the border areas. He had two sons, Ch\u00f6nkhor Kyap (chos \u2019khor skyabs) and Samy\u00e9 Trashi (bsam yas bkra shis). Ch\u00f6nkhor Kyap went to the Yuan court and received a golden seal. After he returned, he became a leader. Since then the size of the family has increased significantly and their descendents have established what is now known as Ch\u00f6nkhor Tsochuknyi (chos \u2019khor tsho bcu gnyis, the Twelve Ch\u00f6nkhor Tsowa [chos \u2019khor <em>tsho ba<\/em>]).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>It has been approximately over seven hundred years since the first ruler of Shitsang, and it is said that there were more than one hundred rulers. But, the direct lineage of the original ruling family eventually ended and after that the leadership was taken over by their relatives and capable men. There were cases that monks also assumed the ruling power. In 1844, Shitsang Monastery was offered to the third K\u00fcnkhyen (kun mkhyen), Jikm\u00e9 Gyatso (\u2019jigs med rgya mtsho). Later during the period of S\u00f6nam Gyatso (bsod nams rgya mtsho) the twelve small monasteries and other retreats in Shitsang were brought together and a large monastery called Shitsang Garser Ganden Ch\u00f6nkhor Ling (shis tshang sgar gser dga\u2019 ldan chos \u2019khor gling) was founded.
