The site is named\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfor a rocky conical mount that rises above the mouth of the effluent valley. <span class=\"popular\">Trandra</span><span class=\"scholar\">Khra &rsquo;dra</span> is situated just below the rim of a long bench that runs along the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tleft side of the valley. The <span class=\"popular emph\">do khang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rdo khang</span> (8 m x 4.7 m) was\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbuilt in two tiers, each of which may have supported three rooms. Only scant structural evidence is still at hand.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMuch of the structure has been swept down the bluff and portions of it have been buried. The walls (45 cm to 60 cm\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthick) are of the dry-mortar random-rubble variety and contain variable-length stones (20 cm to 80 cm). The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmaximum extant elevation of a wall fragment is 1.7 m. Some of the structure has been filled with sand that has\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfallen from the bluff. This heavily built structure clearly had an all-stone roof assembly. On the east side of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe upper tier, a couple of roof slabs are still in situ. The larger of these slabs (1.2 m long) shelters a space\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat has almost completely filled up with soil. A partially submerged corbel 1 m in length was detected at the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsite.
