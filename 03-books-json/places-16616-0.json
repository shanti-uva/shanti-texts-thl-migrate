The site is named for a rocky conical mount that rises above the mouth of the effluent valley. <span class=\"popular\">Trandra<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Khra &rsquo;dra<\/span> is situated just below the rim of a long bench that runs along the left side of the valley. The <span class=\"popular emph\">do khang<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rdo khang<\/span> (8 m x 4.7 m) was built in two tiers, each of which may have supported three rooms. Only scant structural evidence is still at hand. Much of the structure has been swept down the bluff and portions of it have been buried. The walls (45 cm to 60 cm hick) are of the dry-mortar random-rubble variety and contain variable-length stones (20 cm to 80 cm). The maximum extant elevation of a wall fragment is 1.7 m. Some of the structure has been filled with sand that has fallen from the bluff. This heavily built structure clearly had an all-stone roof assembly. On the east side of he upper tier, a couple of roof slabs are still in situ. The larger of these slabs (1.2 m long) shelters a space hat has almost completely filled up with soil. A partially submerged corbel 1 m in length was detected at the site. In a wall of the lower tier another corbel appears to be in situ. <\/p> "},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":" <p>According to local sources, kha &rsquo;dra is an ancient residential structure. <\/p> "},{"title":"Affiliated sites","index":6,"parent_index":2,"body":" "},{"title":"Khra &rsquo;dra agriculture","index":7,"parent_index":6,"body":null}]}
