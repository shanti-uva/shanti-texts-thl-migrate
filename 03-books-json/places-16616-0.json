The site is named for a rocky conical mount that rises above the mouth of the effluent valley. <span class=\"popular\">Trandra</span><span class=\"scholar\">Khra ’dra</span> is situated just below the rim of a long bench that runs along the left side of the valley. The <span class=\"popular emph\">do khang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rdo khang</span> (8 m x 4.7 m) was built in two tiers, each of which may have supported three rooms. Only scant structural evidence is still at hand. Much of the structure has been swept down the bluff and portions of it have been buried. The walls (45 cm to 60 cm thick) are of the dry-mortar random-rubble variety and contain variable-length stones (20 cm to 80 cm). The maximum extant elevation of a wall fragment is 1.7 m. Some of the structure has been filled with sand that has fallen from the bluff. This heavily built structure clearly had an all-stone roof assembly. On the east side of the upper tier, a couple of roof slabs are still in situ. The larger of these slabs (1.2 m long) shelters a space that has almost completely filled up with soil. A partially submerged corbel 1 m in length was detected at the site. In a wall of the lower tier another corbel appears to be in situ. </p> "},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":" <p>According to local sources, kha ’dra is an ancient residential structure. </p> "},{"title":"Affiliated sites","index":6,"parent_index":2,"body":" "},{"title":"Khra ’dra agriculture","index":7,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p> <span class=\"popular\">Trandra</span><span class=\"scholar\">Khra ’dra</span>, the left effluent of the <span class=\"popular\">Rama</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ra ma</span> valley, supports the most extensive agriculture still carried out in <span class=\"popular\">Reco</span><span class=\"scholar\">Re co</span>. These viable fields are situated amid ancient ‘mon’ agricultural lands. Old retaining walls (<span class=\"popular emph\">Zhingra</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">zhing ra</span>) are visible everywhere. Perhaps only 10% of the original farmland in the <span class=\"popular\">Rama</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ra ma</span> valley is still being cultivated. According to <span class=\"popular\">Döndrup Püntsok</span><span class=\"scholar\">Don grub phun tshogs</span> (born circa 1923), a native of <span class=\"popular\">Rama</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ra ma</span>, the <span class=\"popular\">Trandra Chu</span><span class=\"scholar\">Khra ’dra chu</span> used to feed many of the upper fields and all those on the west side of the main valley in ancient times. The <span class=\"popular\">Trandra Chu</span><span class=\"scholar\">Khra ’dra chu</span> is now sometimes dry even in the summer months, so the fields it used to irrigate have been long since abandoned. <span class=\"popular\">Döndrup Püntsok</span><span class=\"scholar\">Don grub phun tshogs</span> attributes the radical reduction in the agricultural production of ra ma to a water shortage. He adds that ‘<span class=\"popular\">Mön</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span>’ fields are found in other valleys (such as <span class=\"popular\">Omlung</span><span class=\"scholar\">’Om lung</span>, <span class=\"popular\">Dzau</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dza’u</span> (sp.?) and <span class=\"popular\">Nyanlung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gnyan lung</span>) in the region, but these were much less extensive than those in <span class=\"popular\">Rama</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ra ma</span>. It is somewhat anomalous that no remains of a settlement or elite architecture were discovered in the <span class=\"popular\">Rama</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ra ma</span> valley, given its erstwhile economic importance. It does, however, support three different funerary sites (D-94, D-95 and D-96). </p>  "}]}
