In view of the large number of invariable verbs, oral Tibetan makes extensive use of these auxiliaries. The latter indicate both the <strong>tense-aspect</strong> and the <strong>evidential nature </strong>of a given statement, which thereby reveals the source of information from which its authority is derived.</p><p class=\"Paragraph\">As far as tense-aspect is concerned, Tibetan distinguishes: future, present (similar to the imperfective past), perfective past, and perfect.</p><p class=\"Paragraph\">Auxiliaries usually go after the main verb, i.e., at the end of the sentence and only rarely within subordinate clauses.</p>",
