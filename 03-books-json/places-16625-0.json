The core of the site consists of an undulating rocky dispersion (130 m x 55 m), which is elevated 1 m to 2 m above the surrounding terrain. This dispersion is marked by rock-filled mounds and depressions. South of the <span class=\"popular\">Kyang Tang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rkyang thang</span> dispersion there is an extensive zone of abandoned agricultural fields. These fields cover the <span class=\"popular\">Kyang Tang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rkyang thang</span> shelf and adjoining areas. The roots of old retaining walls divide the defunct fields into neatly delineated parcels. The agrarian nature of these fields is confirmed by the local oral tradition. There is an abandoned Communist period homestead at <span class=\"popular\">Kyang Tang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rkyang thang</span>. As a rule, <span class=\"popular emph\">drok pa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">’brog pa</span> do not like to live amid derelict ancient settlements. </p>
