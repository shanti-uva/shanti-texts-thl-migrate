Post-Tantra is not an indigenous label, but expresses their simultaneous grounding in Tantra and the rejection of many of its fundamental paradigms. The most famous are the Great Perfection (Rdzogs chen [Dzogchen]) in Rnying ma ED: reject change [Nyingma] and Bon lineages, and the Great Seal (Phyag chen [Chakchen]; Skt., mah\u0101mudr\u0101), found in the Bka\u2019 brgyud ED: reject change (Kagyu), Sa skya ED: reject change (Sakya), and Dge lugs ED: reject change (Geluk) schools. Their texts decline to specify contemplative procedures such as breathing, posture, concentration, visualization, or guided reveries, and consist of philosophical and poetic meditations on the nature of enlightenment. Such rhetoric left many wondering as to whether they formed contemplative paths, or instead were merely descriptions of realization. They are often characterized by a rhetoric of supremacy beyond s\u016btra and Tantra, while at times they are self-characterized as belonging to s\u016btra or Tantra. However, these traditions can be viewed as symbiotic with other contemplative traditions both in terms of being deconstructions of preoccupation with technique, and a type of aesthetic gazing and poetics of contemplative experiences. The recitation and reading of such texts offered subtle guides to contextualize the various meditative experiences to which other practices had given rise.

These techniques tend to be recognizable variations of exoteric practices of calming, insight, and emptiness yogas, but they focus on cultivating deconstruction of such states of concentration to foster an open and free-flowing awareness without negating appearances, emotions, and thoughts. The techniques themselves are often distinctive in terms of modifications in line with the rhetoric of simplicity, spontaneity, naturalness, and innate divinity. In this context the Great Seal tradition discusses four yogas\u2014the one pointed (rtse gcig), the non-elaborate (spros bral), the single flavor (ro gcig), and nonmeditation (sgom med).

The most influential of these was the Seminal Heart (Snying thig [Nyingthik]), which created anthologies of Tantric and non-Tantric Buddhist contemplations. The most distinctive innovations were the two principal practices of \u201cbreakthrough\u201d (khregs chod) and \u201cdirect transcendence\u201d (thod rgal). The former represents a cultivation of one\u2019s own naked self-awareness as directed by intensely poetic guided reveries, whereas the latter is a transmutation of perfection-phase techniques contemplating a spontaneous flow of light imagery.
