From this point on, Ngor emerged as a distinctive sub-sect with many monasteries considering themselves affiliated with Ngor rather than Sakya proper. This includes the famous Deg&eacute; G&ouml;nchen Lh&uuml;ndrup Teng (sde dge dgon chen lhun grub steng [?]) and its associated printery. Indeed, Ngor eventually emerged as the dynamic center of the Sakya tradition. (Ronald Davidson &ndash; June 21, 2004)</p>","title":"An Overview of the Ngorpa Sakya Tradition"}]}
