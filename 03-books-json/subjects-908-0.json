   "body": "<p>The Sakya tradition remained more or less unitary until 1429, when the monastery of Ngor Evam Chöden (ngor e bam chos ldan) was founded by the great Sakya scholar Ngorchen Künga Zangpo (kun dga' bzang po, 1382-1444) in Tsang (gtsang) not far from Zhikatsé (gzhis ka rtse). From this point on, Ngor emerged as a distinctive sub-sect with many monasteries considering themselves affiliated with Ngor rather than Sakya proper. This includes the famous Degé Gönchen Lhündrup Teng (sde dge dgon chen lhun grub steng [?]) and its associated printery. Indeed, Ngor eventually emerged as the dynamic center of the Sakya tradition.
