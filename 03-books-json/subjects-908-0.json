From this point on, Ngor emerged as a distinctive sub-sect with many monasteries considering themselves affiliated with Ngor rather than Sakya proper. This includes the famous Deg\u00e9 G\u00f6nchen Lh\u00fcndrup Teng (sde dge dgon chen lhun grub steng [?]) and its associated printery. Indeed, Ngor eventually emerged as the dynamic center of the Sakya tradition. (Ronald Davidson \u2013 June 21, 2004)<\/p>","title":"An Overview of the Ngorpa Sakya Tradition"}]}
