The axis of this single cluster\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof low-elevation buildings runs northwest-southeast and is 36.5 m in length (the length of the spur). The complex\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tis primarily 6 m to 8 m wide (the width of the spur). The edges of the summit are completely revetted. These\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tprominent revetments are 1 m to 3 m in height. In some places along the rim of the rocky summit, fissures are\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbridged by stone members around 80 cm in length, forming the base of the revetments. Multiple ramparts guarded the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmain access-way to the castle on the southeast side of the spur. The entire facility was built of variable-sized\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tuncut granite blocks (generally 20 cm to 40 in length) laid in random-rubble courses with ample amounts of mud\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmortar. Most of this mortar, however, has dissolved from the wall seams. Granite blocks up to 70 cm in length are\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfound in some walls.

Immediately to the northwest, at 1 m higher elevation,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthere is a band of at least five or six rooms stretching across 17.3 m of the summit (3 m to 6.3 m wide here).\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOnly the footings of the partition walls are partly intact. Revetments are up to 1.7 m in height. In the east\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twall of this group of rooms there are the remains of the main entrance to the citadel. It rises 1.5 m and steps\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmust have once scaled this inlet. About 2 m below the base of the entrance there is a revetted rocky ledge (5 m\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tx 2.5 m x up to 1.9 m). The main access route to the castle appears to have passed via this ledge. This\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thorizontal projection probably functioned as a landing and as a defensive platform if need be. About 6 m lower\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdown there is another revetted ledge (3.5 m x 4.3 m). Approximately 6 m further down is yet another revetted\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tledge (6 m x 4 m). The walls lining this ledge are 3 m in height, 70 cm of which is freestanding. A stone-filled\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdepression on top of the structure is spanned by a single in situ large stone corbel protruding 50 cm from the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tparapet wall. This must have been one element in either a floor or roof assembly, the rest of which is no longer\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\textant.
