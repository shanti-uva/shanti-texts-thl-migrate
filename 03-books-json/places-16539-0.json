The summit (9.5 m x 10 m) of this limestone formation is blanketed in rubble, which pours\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdown the flanks of the hill for a distance of 2 m to 5 m on all sides. The steep hillside gives the site a fairly\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgood defensive position, however, higher ground to the north and south could potentially have been used to harass\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe occupants with volleys of arrows and stones. The structures were built of uncut limestone blocks of variable\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsize (15 cm to 80 cm). Only small sections of the rampart that encircled the summit are still intact. They were\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconstructed of random-rubble.
