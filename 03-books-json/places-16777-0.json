The massive rammed earth walls of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfortress are up to 1.3 m thick. These walls are long and straight, giving rise to a rectangular plan not unlike\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMoghul fortresses of north India. There are also a few stone and adobe-block\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twalls of the old residential structures still intact. On the west end of the fortress there are F-shaped\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tloopholes and the remains of two round defensive towers set outside the ramparts. The entire citadel appears to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thave been circumvallated.
