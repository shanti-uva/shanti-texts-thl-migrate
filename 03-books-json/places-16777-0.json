The site enjoys a commanding location above the two river valleys and would have been a prominent geographic feature of ancient settlement at <span class=\"popular\">Trashi Gang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bkra shis sgang</span>. The terrain is sandy and rock-strewn. The site consists of five clusters of heaped-stone wall ovoid enclosures and one isolated specimen situated at two different locations. Each enclosure or cell measures 1.8 m to 5.5 m across. Variable-length (30 cm to 80 cm long) stones are piled up to a maximum height of 50 cm to 1 m. These heaped-stone walls originally may have been somewhat higher. It is possible that each cluster of ovoid cells were surrounded by an outer perimeter wall, but here is insufficient in situ structural evidence from which to make a positive determination. Some of the funerary superstructures at <span class=\"popular\">Ser Riri</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ser ris ris</span> were modified to create shepherd shelters or other types of structures. Some enclosures contain concavities up to 1 m deep. These appear to be signs of excavations carried out well in the past.

Nevertheless, some residents of <span class=\"popular\">Trashi Gang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bkra shis sgang</span> hold that <span class=\"popular\">Ganden Tsewang Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dga’ ldan tshe dbang mkhar</span> was built by the famous general <span class=\"popular\">Ganden Tsewang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dga’ ldan tshe dbang</span> in his campaign against the <span class=\"popular\">Ladak</span><span class=\"scholar\">La dwags</span> <span />army (he ousted the <span class=\"popular\">Ladakpa</span><span class=\"scholar\">La dwags pa</span> from <span class=\"popular\">Ngari Korsum</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mnga’ ris skor gsum</span> in 1680 CE). This oral tradition, however, appears to be apocryphal. As <span class=\"popular\">Ganden Tsewang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dga’ ldan tshe dbang</span> took control of the <span class=\"popular\">Trashi Gang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bkra shis sgang</span> and <span class=\"popular\">Tsarang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rtsa rang</span> citadels in 1680 CE,<a href=\"#n63\" name=\"nb63\" class=\"note\">63</a> there does not seem to be any strategic reason why he would build a much smaller garrison on the ridgeback above the <span class=\"popular\">Trashi Gang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bkra shis sgang</span> citadel. The construction of such an installation would not have been militarily feasible while the <span class=\"popular\">Ladak</span><span class=\"scholar\">La dwags</span>army was still in control of the <span class=\"popular\">Trashi Gang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bkra shis sgang</span> citadel and environs, and it would have been redundant after their conquest. The hidden ridge-top location of the site, the highly deteriorated condition of the ruins and their general morphological traits are more in keeping with the archaic cultural strongholds that dot the <span class=\"popular\">Gar Tsangpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sgar gtsang po</span> and <span class=\"popular\">Senge Tsangpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sengge gtsang po</span> valleys (see A-22, A-23, A-41, A-42, A-43, A-44, A-66, A-67, A-124, A-125, A-126). The ancient settlement pattern exhibited in this region is marked by the construction of a stronghold perched above each major agricultural enclave. <span class=\"popular\">Trashi Gang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bkra shis sgang</span>, one of these agrarian pockets, is likely to have experienced the same type of cultural occupation. </p> "},{"title":"bKra shis sgang","index":11,"parent_index":9,"body":" <p> <span class=\"popular\">Trashi Gang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bkra shis sgang</span> has extensive farmlands irrigated by the <span class=\"popular\">Miktrin Tsangpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mig sprin gtsang po</span>. According to a local elder, respected for his knowledge of history, named <span class=\"popular\">Rindzin Dorjé</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rig ’dzin rdo rje</span> (born in the Iron Dog Year, circa 1934), the origins of agriculture at <span class=\"popular\">Trashi Gang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bkra shis sgang</span> can be raced back to the ancient <span class=\"popular\">Mön</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span>. The monastery of <span class=\"popular\">Trashi Gang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bkra shis sgang</span> was built inside the ruins of a large citadel situated on a small eminence in the <span class=\"popular\">Senge Tsangpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sengge gtsang po</span> valley. The massive rammed earth walls of the fortress are up to 1.3 m thick. These walls are long and straight, giving rise to a rectangular plan not unlike Moghul fortresses of north India. There are also a few stone and adobe-block walls of the old residential structures still intact. On the west end of the fortress there are F-shaped loopholes and the remains of two round defensive towers set outside the ramparts. The entire citadel appears to have been circumvallated.
