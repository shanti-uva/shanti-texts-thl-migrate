The site enjoys a commanding location above the two river valleys and would have been a prominent geographic feature of ancient settlement at <span class=\"popular\">Trashi Gang<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Bkra shis sgang<\/span>. The terrain is sandy and rock-strewn. The site consists of five clusters of heaped-stone wall ovoid enclosures and one isolated specimen situated at two different locations. Each enclosure or cell measures 1.8 m to 5.5 m across. Variable-length (30 cm to 80 cm long) stones are piled up to a maximum height of 50 cm to 1 m. These heaped-stone walls originally may have been somewhat higher. It is possible that each cluster of ovoid cells were surrounded by an outer perimeter wall, but here is insufficient in situ structural evidence from which to make a positive determination. Some of the funerary superstructures at <span class=\"popular\">Ser Riri<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Ser ris ris<\/span> were modified to create shepherd shelters or other types of structures. Some enclosures contain concavities up to 1 m deep. These appear to be signs of excavations carried out well in the past. Due to these disturbances, the clusters of cells at <span class=\"popular\">Ser Riri<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Ser ris ris<\/span> are not very well preserved. <\/p> "},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":null},{"title":"Site elements","index":6,"parent_index":2,"body":" "},{"title":"Lower site","index":7,"parent_index":6,"body":null},{"title":"Upper site","index":8,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p>The upper site is situated 110 m west of the lower site in a fairly level fold of the ridge (29.88&#900; \/ 40.217&#900; \/ 4340 m).
