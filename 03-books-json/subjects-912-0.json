   "body": "<p>The Zhalu (zhwa lu) tradition dates to the foundation of Zhalu (zhwa lu) Monastery by Chetsün Sherap Jungné (lce btsun shes rab 'byung gnas) in 1040. The tradition also embraces Gyengong (rgyan gong(?)), a small temple nearby. In this regard, it could be argued that this is a rare instance of the early temple networks of the Eastern Vinaya movement developing into a sectarian tradition. While other Tibetan scholars sometimes talk of Zhalu as being Sakya, Sakya authors themselves rarely do so and Zhalu scholars themselves tend to classify themselves as being a distinctive tradition. No doubt the independence of Zhalu stems from the fame of its thirteenth-fourteenth century resident, Butön Rinchendrup (bu ston rin chen grub). Butön was not only a famed scholar with prolific output, but also was the most famous editor behind the compilation of the main Buddhist literary canon during this period.
