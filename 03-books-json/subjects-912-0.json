The tradition also embraces Gyengong (rgyan gong(?)), a small temple nearby. In this regard, it could be argued that this is a rare instance of the early temple networks of the Eastern Vinaya movement developing into a sectarian tradition. While other Tibetan scholars sometimes talk of Zhalu as being Sakya, Sakya authors themselves rarely do so and Zhalu scholars themselves tend to classify themselves as being a distinctive tradition. No doubt the independence of Zhalu stems from the fame of its thirteenth-fourteenth century resident, Butön Rinchendrup (bu ston rin chen grub). Butön was not only a famed scholar with prolific output, but also was the most famous editor behind the compilation of the main Buddhist literary canon during this period.
