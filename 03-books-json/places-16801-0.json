The site is also in the shadow of a red mountain called <span class=\"popular\">Marpo Damchok</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dmar po dam phyog</span>. This locale is part of a region traditionally known as dang chung stod ma. The six funerary structures of <span class=\"popular\">Dringak</span><span class=\"scholar\">Grib ’gag</span>are situated on both benches that flank a stream. The obdurate terrain is level, sandy and gravelly. The presence of a house on each side of the stream, as well as <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma ṇi </span>walls and <span class=\"popular emph\">tsa tsa khang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">tshwa tshwa khang</span> indicate that the site has been heavily disturbed. The fragmentary structures mostly consist of double-course enclosures with walls hat are flush with the surface or which slightly project above it. Due to their disintegration, the precise shape of the enclosures is no longer clear. Several types of uncut, variable-length blocky rocks and a few slabs (20 cm o 50 cm long) went into the construction of the enclosures. </p>",
