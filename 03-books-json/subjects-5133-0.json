It is used to emphasize a group of words preceding it, or else it “thematizes” something—that is, it introduces the topic that is about to be developed. In English, when the thematization concerns the object, the marker <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ནི་</span> may be rendered by moving the object to the beginning of the sentence and emphasizing it with some expression such as “as for” or “regarding.” Sometimes it may even be left untranslated.</p> <ul> <li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">པང་གདན་ནི་སྐྱེད་དམན་ཚང་མས་གོན་གྱི་རེད།</span> “As for aprons, all women wear them.”</li> <li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">མེ་ནི་བཏང་(གཏོང་)དགོས་མེད།</span> “As for a fire, we don’t need to light one.”</li> </ul>","title":""}]}
