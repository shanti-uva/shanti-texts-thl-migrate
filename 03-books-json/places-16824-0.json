The site is open in all directions. <span class=\"popular\">Shakde Möndur</span><span class=\"scholar\">Shag sde mon dur</span> is found on high, level, gravel-strewn ground, and is surrounded by various basins. The site consists of three enclosures with open interiors, which are constructed of sandstone blocks. Corrals that appear to have a parasitic relationship with ancient funerary structures have come up on the site. There are two corrals that contain the same type of sandstone blocks as the funerary enclosures. In any event, the funerary superstructures do not appear to have been ampered with in recent years. The <span class=\"popular\">Shakde</span><span class=\"scholar\">Shag sde</span> pastoral camp is occupied during the third lunar month.</p>",
