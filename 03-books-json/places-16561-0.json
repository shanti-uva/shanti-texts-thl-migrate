The once large citadel is divided into southeast and northwest (main) complexes. The ruins of <span class=\"popular\">Jekar Khargok</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bye dkar mkhar gog</span> are highly degraded: all that is left are a few scattered stone wall fragments and much rubble. The buildings and individual rooms ended to be small. The thinness of the walls and the lack of buttressing indicate that most, if not all, of the buildings of <span class=\"popular\">Jekar Khargok</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bye dkar mkhar gog</span> were constructed with wooden roofs. Walls (40 cm to 50 cm thick) contain small uncut blocks (10 cm to 40 cm long) and are of a heavily mud-mortared random-rubble texture. The diminutive size of the structures, the presence of irregular ground plans and the staggering of buildings around crags all hint at an archaic cultural status for <span class=\"popular\">Jekar Khargok</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bye dkar mkhar gog</span>. Unlike the neighboring monastery of <span class=\"popular\">Namgyel</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rnam rgyal lha rtse</span>, his more removed site is endowed with a good defensive posture.

The west sector appears to have been circumvallated. The summit of the outcrop is ringed by a revetment (up to 1.5 m in height, none of which is freestanding) that was part of this defensive work. Most of the summit is surrounded by vertical limestone faces. At the lower or west end of the west sector a building or room is distinguishable (interior dimensions: 5.7 m x 2.4 m maximum). One of its standing wall fragments reaches 2.4 m in height, 40 cm of which is part of the revetment. The east end of the west sector is about 10 m higher than the west end and contains the vestiges of several buildings. They include one with two rooms (exterior dimensions: 6 m x 5.2 m maximum); a structure of one room built 1 m into the summit (5.3 m x 3.6 m), and a building with several small rooms (9.4 m x 4.2 m). The eastern extremity of the summit narrows to a knife edge and hosts no structural detritus.</p> "},{"title":"East sector","index":9,"parent_index":7,"body":" <p>The east sector is sheltered below the summit on the south side of the outcrop. The west end of the east sector supports a single line of structures that extend beyond the eastern edge of the west sector. The east side of the east sector is 22 m wide and probably supported three tiers of buildings along a 45° slope. Many of these structures have fallen down the steep sides of the formation. On the east end of the east sector here is a relatively well-preserved building with a single room (5.4 m x 5.1 m). Mud plaster still adheres to he interior and exterior of the 2-m to 3-m tall walls. There is a small prayer flag mast inside this building. Its physical state of preservation and design traits are out of character with the rest of the site. The morphology of this structure suggests a Buddhist identity, possibly a house used for retreats. Fifteen meters below the east sector there is a lone building (5 m x 4.2 m) with revetments up to 2 m in height. This is likely to have been an outwork guarding the southern flank of <span class=\"popular\">Jekar Khargok</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bye dkar mkhar gog</span>.</p> "},{"title":"Southeast complex","index":10,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p>This small installation is located 57 m southeast of the main complex. It occupies a rocky knob (4.5 m x 10 m). The southeast complex has been reduced to fragmentary revetments that line the formation. These revetments reach a maximum height of 1.5 m. Between the northwest and southeast complexes there are the footings of a quadrate structure (3.8 m x 3m) aligned in the cardinal directions. These appear to be the foundation of a ceremonial structure. Its configuration and location is in conformance with shrines found at various archaic citadels. </p> "},{"title":"rNam rgyal lha rtse","index":11,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p>The moderately sized monastery of <span class=\"popular\">Namgyel</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rnam rgyal lha rtse</span> (31° 36.5΄ N. lat. / 79° 00.2΄ E. long. / 3830 m to 3870 m), a Buddhist complex, was founded on southern slopes directly below <span class=\"popular\">Jekar Khargok</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bye dkar mkhar gog</span>.

The main source of water for the village passes over the top of this saddle.

In addition to buildings with long, straight, high-elevation earthen walls set on limestone foundations, there were 14 or 15 main <span class=\"popular emph\">Chörten</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mchod rten</span> at the main monastic site. The old assembly hall (<span class=\"popular emph\">dükhang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">’dus khang</span>) is said to have had 18 pillars. On the summit of the outcrop north of the saddle there was a single building constructed upon a prominent limestone revetment. This revetment may constitute traces of fortifications that probably once stood here. Given the strategic location on a main route to <span class=\"popular\">Jekar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bye dkar</span> and the vulnerability of the site’s flanks to attack, it seems likely that defensive works were established on the north summit to help protect access to <span class=\"popular\">Jekar Khargok</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bye dkar mkhar gog</span>. No attempt, however, was made o fortify the monastic facility here as it was founded after 1000 CE, an era of changed strategic concerns. </p> <hr class=\"footnote-divider\" /> "},{"title":"Notes","index":12,"parent_index":0,"body":" <div class=\"footnote\"> <a name=\"n59\" /> <a href=\"#nb59\" class=\"note\"> [59] </a> <span class=\"popular\">Jekar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bye dkar</span> is situated on a plateau perched high above the<span class=\"popular\">Zarang Tsangpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Za rang gtsang po</span>.
