This light-colored unhewn stone was erected on flat, sandy ground covered in river\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstones. The <span class=\"popular\">Chaktak Tsangpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Lcags thag gtsang po</span> is less\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthan 100 m away and fluvial deposits show that the site must have flooded at least once. The tabular pillar is 1.1\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tm in height and has a basal girth of 1.1 m. As is customary in this monument typology, the broad sides of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstanding stone face north and south. Ostensible traces of the north wall of the enclosure are represented by three\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstones (each around 30 cm in length) oriented in an east-west direction. An elderly herder (<span class=\"popular emph\">drok\npa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">&rsquo;brog pa</span>) who hails from the locale confirmed that the pillar was, at one time,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsurrounded by a stone enclosure. This information, the mythology and the morphological characteristics of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstructures confirm the typological identity of the site. <span class=\"popular\">Beltsa Gyangtrok</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bal tshwa gyang khrog</span> is the most easterly example of stelae erected within an\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tenclosure situated south of the Transhimalaya discovered to date.
