   "body": "<p> <span class=\"popular\">Beltsa Gyangtrok</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bal tshwa gyang khrog</span> consists of a single quartzitic sandstone pillar that is well rooted in the ground despite the site having been heavily disturbed by road construction. This light-colored unhewn stone was erected on flat, sandy ground covered in river stones. The <span class=\"popular\">Chaktak Tsangpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Lcags thag gtsang po</span> is less han 100 m away and fluvial deposits show that the site must have flooded at least once. The tabular pillar is 1.1 m in height and has a basal girth of 1.1 m. As is customary in this monument typology, the broad sides of the standing stone face north and south. Ostensible traces of the north wall of the enclosure are represented by three stones (each around 30 cm in length) oriented in an east-west direction. An elderly herder (<span class=\"popular emph\">drok pa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">’brog pa</span>) who hails from the locale confirmed that the pillar was, at one time, surrounded by a stone enclosure. This information, the mythology and the morphological characteristics of the structures confirm the typological identity of the site. <span class=\"popular\">Beltsa Gyangtrok</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bal tshwa gyang khrog</span> is the most easterly example of stelae erected within an enclosure situated south of the Transhimalaya discovered to date. This example of the II.1b typology is located 80 km northwest of <span class=\"popular\">Tsanglha Pudar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gtsang lha phu dar</span>, a traditional boundary mountain of <span class=\"popular\">Tsang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gtsang</span> and <span class=\"popular\">Zhang Zhung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Zhang zhung</span>, according to Bon sources. <span class=\"popular\">Beltsa Gyangtrok</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bal tshwa gyang khrog</span>‘s location at the edge of the main east-west road (<span class=\"popular emph\">gyalam</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rgya lam</span>) to southwestern Tibet puts what remains of this pillar monument at extreme risk.</p>
