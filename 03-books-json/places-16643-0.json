This light-colored unhewn stone was erected on flat, sandy ground covered in river stones. The <span class=\"popular\">Chaktak Tsangpo<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Lcags thag gtsang po<\/span> is less han 100 m away and fluvial deposits show that the site must have flooded at least once. The tabular pillar is 1.1 m in height and has a basal girth of 1.1 m. As is customary in this monument typology, the broad sides of the standing stone face north and south. Ostensible traces of the north wall of the enclosure are represented by three stones (each around 30 cm in length) oriented in an east-west direction. An elderly herder (<span class=\"popular emph\">drok pa<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">&rsquo;brog pa<\/span>) who hails from the locale confirmed that the pillar was, at one time, surrounded by a stone enclosure.
