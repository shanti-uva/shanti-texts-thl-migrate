History","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":"<p>The bo township of mDzod dge county is geographically and traditionally part of The bo county in present day Kan lho Prefecture, Kansu Province. In the 13th Rab yung (1747-1806), at the time of gZa\u2019 ru Khro rgyal, the chief of the gZa\u2019 ru tribe, there was a village called Bon sde stod ma near gTso tshang Monastery (No.91), whose religious gathering place was a temple of A skyid sKyang tshang Monastery (No.194) in Ma ru village of gZa\u2019 ru tribe where a few monks lived, known as Bon sde stod ma. But as the religious practitioners did not live according to monastic vows, it was decided that the monastery should be moved to a more isolated spot. Thus A tshogs tshang of A skyid sKyang tshang Monastery bought the present site of the monastery in exchange for a white cow and other goods. The new monastery was named Nyos zhing, literally \u201cfield that was bought\u201d. After the monastery was completed, the monasteries of sKyang tshang, gTso tshang and the local lay community decided that since it was A tshogs tshang who built the monastery, it would remain a branch of sKyang tshang Monastery, but that since it was located nearer gTso tshang, the latter would take charge of the monastery and the chief of the local gZa\u2019 ru tribe would be the monastery\u2019s patron. The agreement was committed to writing and signed by all parties.
