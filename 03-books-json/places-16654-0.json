This\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgraceful pillar is only 20 cm to 30 cm wide on each of its four sides. Next to it there is a tabular pillar (1.6\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tm x 1 m) with stones piled against it. In close proximity to the two standing stones there are three dislodged\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tspecimens, one of which is 2 m in length. As they are partially submerged, the length of the other two uprooted\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tones could not be determined. Visible portions of them are 1.9 m and 1.8 m in length. Sixteen meters west of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttallest stele there is a 75-cm long rock slab fixed in the ground, which appears to be the sole surviving\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tappurtenance of a superstructure. There are other stones scattered about, in the proximity, that may have been\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpart of integral constructions as well, but not enough is extant to discern their character. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>There is also a group of eight unbroken prostrate pillars situated 36 m southeast of the two standing examples.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThese pillars are four-sided and tabular. They have the same slim form and are made of the same dark-colored\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trock as their in situ counterparts. These collapsed stelae form a row of stones with a north-south orientation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFrom west to east these pillars measure 1.3 m (partly buried), 1.9 m, 2.4 m, 2 m, 2m (partly buried), 1.7 m, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2 m (partly buried) in length. The most easterly unbroken specimen is still rooted in the ground despite its\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tradical tilt. It sticks 1.9 m out of the ground and has a basal girth of 1.9 m. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Funerary superstructures","index":8,"parent_index":6,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Some distance away from the pillars, at slightly lower elevation, there are two dispersions of single-course\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trectangular stone enclosures. They were erected on open sandy ground and are not well aligned in the cardinal\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdirections. These enclosures are funerary in character but it could not be determined if they had a burial or\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnon-burial function. The enclosures are made from stones up to 80 cm in length, the regular faces of which\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsuggest that some of them may have been partially cut into shape. These stones are flush with the ground surface\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tor raised a maximum of 20 cm above it. Most integrated stones appear to have been laid flat but some may have\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen installed in the ground edgewise as well. Rocks of different colors and types were used in the construction\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the enclosures. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>A row of at least five enclosures begins 78 m north of funerary structure FS6. This group of enclosures extends\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin a northwest line for 70 m. There is evidence indicating that there were more than five specimens in the row,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbut these additional enclosures are now either too heavily degraded or obscured by the sandy ground to make a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpositive assessment.
