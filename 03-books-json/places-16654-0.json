This graceful pillar is only 20 cm to 30 cm wide on each of its four sides. Next to it there is a tabular pillar (1.6 m x 1 m) with stones piled against it. In close proximity to the two standing stones there are three dislodged specimens, one of which is 2 m in length. As they are partially submerged, the length of the other two uprooted ones could not be determined. Visible portions of them are 1.9 m and 1.8 m in length. Sixteen meters west of the allest stele there is a 75-cm long rock slab fixed in the ground, which appears to be the sole surviving appurtenance of a superstructure. There are other stones scattered about, in the proximity, that may have been part of integral constructions as well, but not enough is extant to discern their character. <\/p> <p>There is also a group of eight unbroken prostrate pillars situated 36 m southeast of the two standing examples. These pillars are four-sided and tabular. They have the same slim form and are made of the same dark-colored rock as their in situ counterparts. These collapsed stelae form a row of stones with a north-south orientation. From west to east these pillars measure 1.3 m (partly buried), 1.9 m, 2.4 m, 2 m, 2m (partly buried), 1.7 m, and 2 m (partly buried) in length. The most easterly unbroken specimen is still rooted in the ground despite its radical tilt. It sticks 1.9 m out of the ground and has a basal girth of 1.9 m. <\/p> "},{"title":"Funerary superstructures","index":8,"parent_index":6,"body":null}]}
