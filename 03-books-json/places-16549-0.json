The highest point of the summit is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdominated by a single rammed-earth structure. This is the only edifice at the site whose plan is still\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdiscernable. In contrast, most other structural remains of the castle are in a state of advanced decay. The way in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhich wall segments are arrayed across the entire summit does seem to indicate that a large facility was once\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlocated here. In the side of the formation overlooking the village there are around 50 caves; these appear to have\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcomprised the original settlement of <span class=\"popular\">Jang Tang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Byang stang</span>. Most of the forward sections of the caves have been obliterated by the collapse of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tformation.

These locational patterns seem to support the <span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span> or non-Buddhist\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tidentification of the site. It seems likely that the construction and maintenance of <span class=\"popular\">Jang Tang Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Byang stang mkhar</span> and the cave residences would\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thave required a larger population than is now found in the village (currently 15 households with a total of around\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t70 people). </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"popular\">Jang Tang Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Byang stang mkhar</span> is said by local\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvillagers to have been an ancient <span class=\"popular\">Kel M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Skal mon</span> castle.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Site elements","index":6,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"High point structure","index":7,"parent_index":6,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The four walls of the large rammed-earth edifice on the vertex of the summit are still partially intact (11.4 m\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tx 11.7 m).

The 50-cm to 60-cm thick walls are punctuated by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trows of stone-lined rectangular orifices used to accommodate shuttering pins during construction. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trammed-earth building was partitioned into at least four rooms. Three of these rooms are situated against the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnorth wall. In the east room, near the current ground level, there is a rectangular window (50 cm x 25 cm). Its\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlintel consists of five small rounds of wood that seem to belong to two different species of tree.
