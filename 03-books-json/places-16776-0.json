In between the benches and valley bottom is a zone of farmland.

All specimens are less than 3 m across. They are aggregated in small groups,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tspread out over a 180-m transection. The bench on which they are located is moderately inclined to the south and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstrewn with rocks. The site is enclosed by gullies on the west and east sides, and thereafter by ridges. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Only a minority of the funerary structures have coherent wall sections, which in part, can be explained by the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfact that some of them were opened on a recent archaeological expedition.<a href=\"#n60\" name=\"nb60\" class=\"note\">60</a> Many of the simply built quadrate and sub-rectangular enclosures and grave pits appear to possess\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsingle-course perimeter walls and those of non-descript construction (50 cm to 75 cm thick). Other superstructures\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tappear to have consisted of the ground surface being entirely covered in stones without any particular pattern\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdiscernable. Stones were laid flat and are generally between 20 cm and 60 cm in length. In addition to the layer\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof stones on the surface, there is a second and sometimes a third layer of stones set below the ground surface.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis stonework is crude in character and the grave pits are very shallow (40 cm to 75 cm deep). Although some of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe grave pits now have an irregular form, it appears that a majority of them were quadrate (some of which were\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmore or less aligned in the cardinal directions). The small enclosures and minimal subsurface constructions of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"popular\">Dingdum</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sdings zlum</span> contrast with many sites on the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"popular\">Jangtang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Byang thang</span>, which are of a much more\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\telaborate nature.

This may possibly indicate that some of these structures had a funerary ritual\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfunction rather than a burial function.
