This indenture is composed of two walls hat project 1.6 m from the main body of the building. This architectural feature is reminiscent of the entranceways found in <span class=\"popular\">Ha La Khar<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Ha la mkhar<\/span>West (A-58) and <span class=\"popular\">Naktsuk Khar<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Nag gtsug mkhar<\/span> (A-57). The entryway walls are as much as 2.3 m high on their exterior sides. Set 1.7 m apart, the enclosed space between he entryway walls rises 1 m to the floor level of the stronghold. This rise must have been ascended by a stairway but nothing of it remains. The original route up the steep east slope to the facility has also been obliterated. Access to the facility is now from the north along the ridge-top. Some stones in the walls of the stronghold were set both vertically and horizontally to create an alternating texture. On the same summit, 17.5 m to the south, there is a single poorly preserved 4 m long wall fragment at ground level.<\/p> "},{"title":"Affiliated sites","index":8,"parent_index":2,"body":" "},{"title":"rDo rje gling","index":9,"parent_index":8,"body":null},{"title":"Notes","index":10,"parent_index":0,"body":null}]}
