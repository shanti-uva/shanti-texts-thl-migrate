The location of his facility deep inside a gorge is possibly best explained by the existence of a route across the <span class=\"popular\">Langchen Tsangpo<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Glang chen gtsang po<\/span> from below this point. This facility could have monitored or controlled the river crossing, helping to regulate trade in the region. The site consists of a single fairly well aligned building (9.5 m x 9.3 m) that straddles a narrow ridge-top. This structure has an open ground plan with no partition walls visible. Exterior wall elevations reach 1.6 m and interior wall elevations 1 m in height. Walls are composed of random-rubble texture, and are 35 cm to 45 cm in hickness. Brown sandstone and to a lesser degree, bluish limestone, was employed in construction. Stones are generally 10 cm to 30 cm in length with the longest specimens reaching 50 cm.<\/p> "},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":" <p>According to villagers in snu, kol mkhar is named for the <span class=\"popular\">Kolwé Lama<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Kol ba’i bla ma<\/span> (sp.?).

The entryway walls are as much as 2.3 m high on their exterior sides. Set 1.7 m apart, the enclosed space between he entryway walls rises 1 m to the floor level of the stronghold. This rise must have been ascended by a stairway but nothing of it remains. The original route up the steep east slope to the facility has also been obliterated. Access to the facility is now from the north along the ridge-top. Some stones in the walls of the stronghold were set both vertically and horizontally to create an alternating texture. On the same summit, 17.5 m to the south, there is a single poorly preserved 4 m long wall fragment at ground level.<\/p> "},{"title":"Affiliated sites","index":8,"parent_index":2,"body":" "},{"title":"rDo rje gling","index":9,"parent_index":8,"body":" <p>In the <span class=\"popular\">Rongchung<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Rong chung<\/span> region of <span class=\"popular\">Tiyak<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Ti yag<\/span> township there is a site called <span class=\"popular\">Dorjé Ling<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo rje gling<\/span>, which is said to have been a fortress before being converted into a monastery.
