This uninhabited area is known as <span class=\"popular\">Burtsé Dok</span><span class=\"scholar\">’Bur rtse dog</span> (Hill Peak Earth). The three standing pillars of <span class=\"popular\">Dowa Sumpa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo ba gsum pa</span> are found on a shelf that rises above the right bank of the <span class=\"popular\">Maja Tsangpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rma bya gtsang po</span>. The pillars are firmly planted, not far from the foot of the ridgeline that encloses he west side of the <span class=\"popular\">Purang Mé</span><span class=\"scholar\">Spu rang smad</span> valley. The views from the site are quite open in all directions. The terrain slopes gently down towards the river and is covered in cobbles, which is consistent with the aftermath of a flood event. If there ever was an enclosure around he pillars, it was destroyed by such flooding. The three pillars form an uneven north-south row and are nearly equidistant to one another. All three pillars are made of a soft gray calcareous stone. The pillars are covered in a red encrustation, the result of geochemical processes.<a href=\"#n49\" name=\"nb49\" class=\"note\">49</a> </p>",
