Since the sacred sites of\n                        the snow mountain rTa sgo, the lake Dwang ra g-yu mtsho and the mountain\n                        called dGe bsnyen are visible from the top of the pass, love and respect\n                        arise in people&rsquo;s minds, which may inspire them to prostrate themselves with\n                        all their faith, to perform the bsang ceremony as an offering and to raise\n                        ritual flags. Many of them, moreover, pile up as many stones as their own\n                        age to make a cairn.</p>\n\n                     <p>Like Gangs Ti se, rMa chen sPom ra, Yar lha Sham po, gNyan chen Thang lha\n                        and sPu rgyal, the sacred snow mountain rTa sgo is an important pilgrimage\n                        site for both Bonpo and Buddhists.</p>\n\n                     <p>The lake Dwang ra g-yu mtsho, as one of the three greatest pilgrimage sites,\n                        is a &ldquo;soul lake&rdquo; (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">bla mtsho</span>). On its shore is a\n                        two-metre-high phallus made of dried mud, in accordance with the ancient\n                        custom in token of worship of the Bonpo protective deities. The term <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">dwang ra</span> is a Zhang zhung word meaning lake (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">mtsho</span>).</p>\n\n                     <p>A number of devotees from Nag tshang Nyi ma rdzong, mNga&rsquo; ris mTsho chen\n                        rdzong and other regions have infinite belief in the sacred blue lake and\n                        the snow mountain. There are always many pilgrims circumambulating the\n                        mountain, but on the 15th day of the fourth Tibetan month in particular, a\n                        huge number of lay devotees and clergy come to accumulate merit through\n                        performing the circumambulation because it is the great pilgrimage day (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">ri bskor che mo</span>). Some of them repeatedly prostrate\n                        themselves and circumambulate the mountain.</p>\n\n                     <p>The road between the above-mentioned pass and Phyug tsho Monastery is not\n                        very good, but it is nice that wild asses, rock goats, cranes and many other\n                        wild animals can be seen on the fields stretching out on both sides.</p>\n\n                     <p>Phyug tsho Monastery is situated on the hill beside the lake Dwang ra g-yu\n                        mtsho. One can see at a glance that among the monasteries of Eternal Bon it\n                        is particularly distinguished.</p>\n\n                     <p>This monastery was built around 1849 by gYo lag sgom chen, a disciple of\n                        sNang ston Zla ba rgyal mtshan. After being founded, it was taken care of by\n                        Khyung ser sMon lam bstan pa, the lama of gcod practice, who had prodigious\n                        knowledge. Thereafter followed the two lamas, the famous Khyung dkar bsTan\n                        pa rgyal mtshan, who had the qualities of wisdom, compassion and power, and\n                        his attendant, the Sa ge gYung drung ye shes. During their time, Bonpo\n                        teachings were kept, defended and spread so well that the monastery\n                        flourished greatly.</p>\n\n                     <p>Later, when the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">dge bshes</span> of gYung drung gling (No.2),\n                        gYung drung bstan pa&rsquo;i rgyal mtshan from Shar khog in Amdo, became the abbot\n                        of this monastery, he renovated it and collected many religious objects.</p>\n\n                     <p>Then the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">dge bshes</span> Khyung dkar bsTan pa lhun grub\n                        followed him as abbot. He arranged for the future supervisor and abbot of\n                        this monastery to be sent from gYung drung gling and that their principal\n                        practice should be based on the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">mKa&rsquo; &rsquo;gro gsang\n                        gcod</span>.</p>\n\n                     <p>At present, Phyug tsho Monastery has a number of buildings: the assembly\n                        hall, a temple, bKa&rsquo; &rsquo;gyur khang, protector&rsquo;s temple, monks&rsquo; quarters and\n                        others. As for the religious objects, there is a statue of sTon pa gShen rab\n                        and many kinds of scriptures, including the <em xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\">bKa&rsquo;\n                           &rsquo;gyur</em> and <em xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\">bKa&rsquo; brten</em>. Of\n                        particular note are the knotted knife and the knotted needle which are\n                        believed to be examples of proof of the spiritual accomplishment of the\n                        masters. There are also a great many medicine-pots, because the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">bum sgrub</span> ritual has customarily been performed in this\n                        monastery.</p>\n\n                     <p>In the protector&rsquo;s temple there are only the images of the Bonpo protective\n                        deities. They look very fearsome.</p>\n\n                     <p>At present, there are fifty monks and one lama in the monastery. Some of the\n                        regular religious services are synchronized, for the most part, with those\n                        of gYung drung gling.</p>\n\n                     <p>Now, retracing our way southward from the lakeshore of Dwang ra g-yu mtsho\n                        to the above-mentioned mountain pass, and travelling several kilometres\n                        south-eastward, we reach the river rTa sgo gtsang po. rTa sgo Ser zhig\n                        Monastery is situated on the west bank of the river. Although it is only a\n                        little more than ten kilometres from the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">xiang</span> to the\n                        monastery, the summer flooding period makes it very difficult for a car to\n                        cross the river.</p>\n\n                  "}]}
