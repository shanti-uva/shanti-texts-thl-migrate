This square enclosure is composed of upright stones protruding upwards of 25 cm above the ground surface.

Variable-length stones laid flat make up the perimeter walls. These stones are even with the ground surface or project above it o a maximum height of 25 cm. There is some evidence indicating that the enclosing walls of FS2 were of the double-course variety. A dislodged stone, 1 m in length, lies beside the enclosure. The west\/lower wall of the enclosure is elevated about 50 cm above the adjacent slope, in order to maintain a level interior. <\/p>"},{"title":"Funerary Structure FS3","index":9,"parent_index":6,"body":"<p>Funerary structure FS3 (14 m x 9 m) is situated 117 m south of FS2.
