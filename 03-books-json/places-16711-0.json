The site is named for btsan sgo, a cleft in a sacred red cliff, situated just northwest of the two walled pillars. From the site, views in all directions but the west are open. The terrain is level and covered in gravel and cobbles. </p>

The double-course walls of the enclosure vary between 50 cm and 80 cm in thickness. They contain variable-length (10 cm to 80 cm long) slabs, blocks and cobbles of various colors and types of rock. Many of the stones of the walls project prominently above ground level (up to a height of 25 cm). Two stones in the east wall are set perpendicular to the course, creating a space 80 cm in width. However, the north-south wall course continues to run in between these two ‘portal’ stones. </p>

The two pillars were planted 90 cm from the inner edge of the west wall. The south pillar is heavily inclined and well centered in the enclosure (80 cm [height] x 1 m [basal girth]). Some of its top section may have been lost. This light brown stele has four uneven sides. The brownish north pillar stands nearer the north wall of the enclosure (70 cm x 1 m). It also has four uneven sides.
