The double-course walls of the enclosure vary between 50 cm and 80 cm in thickness. They contain variable-length (10 cm to 80 cm long) slabs, blocks and cobbles of various colors and types of rock. Many of the stones of the walls project prominently above ground level (up to a height of 25 cm). Two stones in the east wall are set perpendicular to the course, creating a space 80 cm in width. However, the north-south wall course continues to run in between these two \u2018portal\u2019 stones. <\/p>"},{"title":"Pillars","index":8,"parent_index":7,"body":"<p>There are two highly eroded pillars remaining in the enclosure. Given its size and the position of the pillars, there may originally have been others standing inside the enclosure. The two pillars were planted 90 cm from the inner edge of the west wall. The south pillar is heavily inclined and well centered in the enclosure (80 cm [height] x 1 m [basal girth]). Some of its top section may have been lost. This light brown stele has four uneven sides. The brownish north pillar stands nearer the north wall of the enclosure (70 cm x 1 m). It also has four uneven sides.
