These buildings are likely to have had all-stone roofs but no signs of them have survived. The highly deteriorated, very small size of the residential structures and defensive walls, staggered at different levels in the formation, are archaic design traits, which corroborate the oral history of an early foundation date. Each of the terraces formed behind the ramparts must have sustained a fortified position of archers, slingers or spear throwers. These level areas in the nearly vertical eminence also may have underpinned either permanent or temporary shelters used by defending troops. All structures are made of random-work dry-mortar granite-block walls. Some of these variable-length blocks (up to 1 m long) were hewn flat on their exterior sides, and were used to produce walls 60 cm to 80 cm thick. <\/p> "},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":null},{"title":"Site elements","index":6,"parent_index":2,"body":" "},{"title":"Summit complex","index":7,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p>The walls on the summit are very fractional, precluding a detailed assessment of their ground plan. Exterior walls reach a maximum height of 3 m and interior walls are 1 m to 2 m high in places. The larger, west end of he summit is separated from the east end by a notch in the formation spanned by a rampart wall. The western edge of the summit is occupied by a building with rounded walls up to 3 m in height and 4 m across. In this structure there is a window opening 40 cm in height. The east end of the summit is encircled by the remains of a defensive wall, now 1 m or less in height. <\/p> "},{"title":"Defensive works on the west and south flanks","index":8,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p>To the west of the summit there are a series of greatly dissolved walls circumscribing terraces with a total length of 20 m. These terraces may have once supported superstructures. On the flanks of the formation are a series of defensive works consisting of walled platforms. Below the summit, on the south side of the formation, here is a retaining wall up to 2.5 in height, creating a level area (2 m x 2 m). Slightly below it is another level area (5.5 m x 2.5 m) enclosed by a highly deteriorated wall. Farther down, on the southwest side of the summit, there is a fragmentary wall bounding a level area 4 m in length. Nearby on a ledge, a wall extends for 10 m towards the east side of the summit. Also in the vicinity are the footings of two more defensive walls. At a lower level, approximately 15 m above the valley floor, there are the foundations of more structures that were closely arrayed on the side of the formation. Also, about 15 m above the valley floor, on the southwest side of he formation, there is revetment that blocks out an area of 6 m x 5 m. Less than 10 m from the base of the valley there is an inclined area enclosed by a retaining wall, 14 m in length and 2 m and 6 m in width. The most substantial portion of this wall is 1.5 m high and 70 cm thick. Below this area there is a very narrow walled ledge. Such a structure could only have had a defensive function unless it was also invested with ritual significance. <\/p> "},{"title":"Structures on the east flanks","index":9,"parent_index":6,"body":null},{"title":"Notes","index":10,"parent_index":0,"body":" <div class=\"footnote\"> <a name=\"n36\" \/> <a href=\"#nb36\" class=\"note\"> [36] <\/a> Less than 50% of arable land in the <span class=\"popular\">Dungkar<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Dung dkar<\/span> valley is now being cultivated.
