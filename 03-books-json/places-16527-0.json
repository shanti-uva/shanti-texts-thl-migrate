Very little of the complex of buildings that\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstood on the hilltop has persisted. A circumvallating wall was constructed on the rim of the summit, which covers\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t85 m x 23 m to 30 m (approximately 1800 m&sup2;). Ringing the inside of this wall is an almost continuous line of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tapproximately 25 building foundations. This type of ground plan almost certainly was designed for defensive\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpurposes. There are very few standing walls and nearly all the footings are disjointed. Most of the central\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tportion of the summit is devoid of structures. Structures were skillfully made with a dark blue metamorphic stone\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat takes on a black color in certain lighting. The block-work is composed of pieces of stone, primarily 10 cm to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t60 cm in length, which were hewn flat on their exterior faces. The neatly built 50-cm to 60-cm thick footings and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\textant freestanding wall fragments demonstrate that they supported superstructures. Structural evidence at the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsite points to the existence of smaller buildings (8 m&sup2; to 40 m&sup2;), which may possibly reflect that they were\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconstructed with all-stone corbelled roofs. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Local residents call <span class=\"popular\">Deunak Gu Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rde&rsquo;u nag gu mkhar</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tan ancient <span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span> castle.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Site elements","index":6,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Castle","index":7,"parent_index":6,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The tallest freestanding wall segment at the site (1.8 m high) formed the south side of a building on the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcentral high point of the summit. Much of the rest of this mud-mortared, random-rubble structure (4.5 m x 4.7 m)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thas been destroyed. This central building divides the summit into north and south sectors. The rampart\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsurrounding the hilltop is most substantial along its south side, because an adjoining saddle made this the most\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlikely breaching point in the event of an attack. Small sections of the defensive wall attain 2 m in height in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe south sector. The rest of the encircling rampart snakes above the steep slopes of the promontory and was\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tless robustly constructed. There is a couple of building foundations on the southeast side of the summit, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbest preserved of which measures 4.5 m x 4.5 m. On the southwest side of the hilltop there are around eight more\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfoundations. On the northeast rim there is a collection of contiguous foundations that appear to have comprised\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\taround six small buildings. In one specimen, the west or rear wall was built 1.4 m into the slope, in the manner\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof all-stone corbelled structures. There are probably another nine foundations along the northeast edge of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsite. There is also a foundation (2.7 m x 3 m) on the saddle adjoining the summit and a foundation (4 m x 3.7 m)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ton the little rise south of the summit. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n"}]}
