Much of the rest of this mud-mortared, random-rubble structure (4.5 m x 4.7 m) has been destroyed. This central building divides the summit into north and south sectors. The rampart surrounding the hilltop is most substantial along its south side, because an adjoining saddle made this the most likely breaching point in the event of an attack. Small sections of the defensive wall attain 2 m in height in he south sector. The rest of the encircling rampart snakes above the steep slopes of the promontory and was less robustly constructed. There is a couple of building foundations on the southeast side of the summit, the best preserved of which measures 4.5 m x 4.5 m. On the southwest side of the hilltop there are around eight more foundations. On the northeast rim there is a collection of contiguous foundations that appear to have comprised around six small buildings. In one specimen, the west or rear wall was built 1.4 m into the slope, in the manner of all-stone corbelled structures. There are probably another nine foundations along the northeast edge of the site. There is also a foundation (2.7 m x 3 m) on the saddle adjoining the summit and a foundation (4 m x 3.7 m) on the little rise south of the summit. <\/p>  "}]}
