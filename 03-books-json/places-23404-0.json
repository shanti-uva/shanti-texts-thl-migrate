His successor, rGyal tshab\n                     Rin chen rgyal mtshan, enlarged it with several monks&rsquo; living quarters. After\n                     having been gradually expanded over four centuries, the monastery became an\n                     important centre for the propagation of Bonpo doctrines. Apart from having two\n                     assembly halls, it had many buildings and there were about three hundred monks\n                     divided among four monastic colleges: Gling stod, Gling smad, Gling skad and\n                     Gling zur and six hostels (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">khang tshan</span>): A sta, Rong mi,\n                     La dbyil, rGyal rong, Grub thob and Drel pa. The monk students came from\n                     various regions of Tibet. Among the Bonpo, the monastery was considered the\n                     source of all their monastic and liturgical traditions.</p>\n\n                  <p>From the founder of the monastery, mNyam med Shes rab rgyal mtshan, to the\n                     abbot Shes rab blo gros, there were thirty-two abbots. The last abbot, Shes rab\n                     blo gros, fled to India in 1959 and later died there. The monastery itself was\n                     completely destroyed during the Cultural Revolution and remained unrestored for\n                     about twenty years. Rebuilding of the monastery did not begin until 1984, and\n                     it is still under reconstruction.</p>\n\n                  <p>In 1970, the new sMan ri Monastery was founded at Dolanji, Himachal Pradesh,\n                     India. With this establishment, the monastic tradition of sMan ri has been\n                     revived through the efforts of its abbot, Lung rtogs bstan pa&rsquo;i nyi ma\n                     (b.1929), who is now counted as the thirty-third abbot of sMan ri.</p>\n\n                  <p>The monastery had a system of abbotship.
