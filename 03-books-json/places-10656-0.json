It is not clear what kind of relationship (chronological, functional and cultural) these residential and ceremonial archaeological sites had. <span class=\"popular\">Drak Tsangpo<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Brag gtsang po<\/span> is composed of no less than 60 sizable rectangular and sub-rectangular enclosures aggregated into at least 15 main groups, which stretch over a northwest-southeast ransection of about 1 km. The walls of many enclosures consist of neatly built double-course white igneous cobbles that have a height of just a single stone. These stones (mostly 15 cm to 35 cm in length) are embedded into the ground surface. Other enclosure walls contain multiple courses of cobbles along their breadth, while still others are made of stones heaped up to a height of 50 cm to 1 m. The enclosure walls vary between 50 cm and 1 m in thickness, with many around 70 cm thick. The enclosures of <span class=\"popular\">Drak Tsangpo<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Brag gtsang po<\/span> are almost certainly funerary in nature. The walls are not of a design typically associated with freestanding structures. Further archaeological inquiry is required if we are to understand the subsurface characteristics of the site. In terms of design and construction, <span class=\"popular\">Drak Tsangpo<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Brag gtsang po<\/span> is closely akin to the enclosures of <span class=\"popular\">Chunak Doring<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Chu nag rdo ring<\/span> (C-121), another large site in extreme southwestern Tibet. <\/p> "},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":" <p>None was collected.<\/p> "},{"title":"Site elements","index":6,"parent_index":2,"body":null}]}
