The enclosure approximately measures 18 m (north-south) x 8 m (east-west). There are no distinguishable signs of its west wall. On the west side of he enclosure, a small trough has formed. Near the northeast corner of the enclosure, a 3.4-m long segment of he north wall is still intact. The incomplete east wall measures 16.3 m, illustrating that this was quite a large enclosure. Near the southeast corner of the enclosure, a 5.2-m long segment of the south wall has also survived. These perimeter walls are around 80 cm thick and composed of double courses or multiple courses (two o four stones laid abreast of one another). The tan, beige and gray blocky stones (15 cm to 40 cm long) were laid flat and are level with, or somewhat raised above, the ground surface. Inside the enclosure near its north end, there are two slab-wall fragments. These two walls run in an east-west direction and are spaced 80 cm apart. The north slab wall is 2.3 m long and the south slab wall is 3.4 long. These double-course slab walls are composed of stones (10 cm to 25 cm long) set into the ground edgewise. The parallel courses of each wall are spaced around 15 cm apart. <\/p> "},{"title":"Pillars","index":8,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p>Across the breadth of the west side of the enclosure there are 22 pillars, all but three of which have collapsed. The three in situ specimens are inclined at severe angles. The fallen pillars are four-sided and irregularly shaped and between 1.5 m and 2.8 m in length. Some of the dislodged pillars are partially submerged, suggesting that they naturally collapsed in place through the agency of gravity and subsurface instability. All but two of the pillars (one of which is still standing: Long-stone DR2) are made of a tan stone (quartzitic sandstone?). The other two in situ specimens are made of a gray metamorphic rock. Another dislodged pillar is found in funerary structure FS15, situated approximately 40 m away. Its original position is unknown. Two of the in situ pillars stand in the middle of the west side of the enclosure. Long-stone DR1 has four irregular sides (1.3 m [height] x 1 m [basal girth]). DR2 is an irregularly shaped (90 cm x 90 cm) pillar. The third standing stone (Long-stone DR3) is found near the north side of the enclosure. DR3 has four irregular sides (1.6 m x 1.2 m). <\/p> <p>An isolated standing pillar (Long-stone DR4) is situated 95 m east of the walled pillars. DR4 is a gray tabular pillar (70 cm x 90 cm). <\/p> "},{"title":"Outlying funerary structures","index":9,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p>Northeast or up valley of the walled pillars there are 15 funerary structures, most or all of which are of the double-course enclosure type. These substantial structures are heavily damaged, limiting the amount of design and construction data that could be gleaned. For the most part, the quadrate and possibly sub-rectangular enclosures appear to have been well built with neatly ordered walls. With perhaps a couple exceptions, the enclosures were not aligned in the cardinal directions. As with analogous structures throughout Upper Tibet, these enclosures must have been the tomb superstructures and\/or funerary ritual venues of an elite component of ancient society. The exclusivist aura of the <span class=\"popular\">Sharma Doring<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Shar ma rdo ring<\/span> enclosures is enhanced by the fact that archaic residential ruins have not been discovered in the area. <\/p> "},{"title":"Funerary Structure FS1","index":10,"parent_index":9,"body":" <p>Funerary structure FS1 (17.5 m x 5.8 m) is situated in the valley bottom.

FS1 is elevated 70 cm to 1 m above the surrounding errain. It was subdivided by a wall into two roughly equal cells. Small fragments of the double-course perimeter walls (50 cm thick) have survived.
