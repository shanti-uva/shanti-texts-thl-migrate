   "body": "<p>A \"Parish\" is term typically used in aÂ  Christian context to signify an administrative unit that is organized around a specific local church. In the Catholic church, these have been part of larger administrative regions known as \"dioceses\". In historic times when Church had central political importance, obviously these could function as political units. It should also be noted that in some countries the word \"parish\" (civil parish) is used to designated an administrative area of civil government, presumably deriving originally from religious parishes. We find this in England, Ireland, the US State of Louisiana, and a few other places.</p>
<p>There is a parallel in Tibet in the context of very local areas where the main political force may have been a monastery, but it was not a broader polity that could be classified as a \"religious principality\". However, such profoundly local polities were not organized into larger religious political units, and so we do not think the term \"parish\" is appropriate. We are thus using the term \"Monastic Parish\".</p>
<p>In Tibet, there were three primary types of small scale political entities that were larger than simply a single self-sufficient village, but smaller than any broad regional polity formation: agricultural estates, nomadic trival areas, and monastic parishes.</p>
