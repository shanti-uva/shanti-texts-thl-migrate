There are only about 20 in situ\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpillars remaining in the array. These pillars are inclined at various angles and protrude 20 cm to 25 cm above\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe rocky ground surface. Nevertheless, there are around 200 uprooted specimens clumped together where they\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twere once planted in the ground. These uncut pieces of local sandstone tend to have a tabular form and are 50\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcm to 70 cm in length. The soil around the array is sandy and quite sodden, suggesting that over the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcenturies, the pillars collapsed of their own accord due to the failure of the substrate. The concourse of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstanding stones tilts down towards the east at an approximately 5&deg; angle, which is probably another factor in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe collapse of the pillars en masse. The declivity of course would have added to the effect of gravity upon\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe standing stones. The scant in situ evidence suggests that the rows of pillars were aligned in the cardinal\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdirections, and that their broad sides faced north and south. The rows appear to have been spaced 45 cm to 75\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcm apart, while the standing stones in each row were spaced 55 cm to 65 cm from one another.
