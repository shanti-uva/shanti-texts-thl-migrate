The maximum height of this structure on the downhill flank is 90 cm, while its upslope side is only slightly raised above ground level. Small coherent wall segments are still extant. The central chamber appears to have been oriented in the cardinal directions, and approximately measures 1.6 m x 1.6 m. Only the base of the central chamber to a depth of 10 cm has survived. The diminutive size of the central chamber indicates that the walls in which it was encased were massively constructed. </p>

These pillars are inclined at various angles and protrude 20 cm to 25 cm above he rocky ground surface. Nevertheless, there are around 200 uprooted specimens clumped together where they were once planted in the ground. These uncut pieces of local sandstone tend to have a tabular form and are 50 cm to 70 cm in length. The soil around the array is sandy and quite sodden, suggesting that over the centuries, the pillars collapsed of their own accord due to the failure of the substrate. The concourse of standing stones tilts down towards the east at an approximately 5° angle, which is probably another factor in he collapse of the pillars en masse. The declivity of course would have added to the effect of gravity upon he standing stones. The scant in situ evidence suggests that the rows of pillars were aligned in the cardinal directions, and that their broad sides faced north and south. The rows appear to have been spaced 45 cm to 75 cm apart, while the standing stones in each row were spaced 55 cm to 65 cm from one another. This spatial pattern is corroborated by the placement of pillars in other small arrays. </p>
