Largely reduced to a mound of rubble, the approximate dimensions of the edifice were 5 m (north-south) x 4 m (east-west). The maximum height of this structure on the downhill flank is 90 cm, while its upslope side is only slightly raised above ground level. Small coherent wall segments are still extant. The central chamber appears to have been oriented in the cardinal directions, and approximately measures 1.6 m x 1.6 m. Only the base of the central chamber to a depth of 10 cm has survived. The diminutive size of the central chamber indicates that the walls in which it was encased were massively constructed. <\/p> "},{"title":"Pillar array","index":9,"parent_index":7,"body":null},{"title":"North complex","index":10,"parent_index":6,"body":" "},{"title":"Appended edifice","index":11,"parent_index":10,"body":" <p>The north complex is situated 65 m north of the south complex at about the same elevation.

There are a few coherent wall fragments extant, especially on the south side of the structure. Where measurable, the outer walls of the edifice were around 70 cm thick, but there may also have been an inner masonry mantle, as is found is some examples of the typology. A slight depression in the middle of the structure coincides with the placement of the central chamber. <\/p> "},{"title":"Pillar array","index":12,"parent_index":10,"body":" <p>Only five inclined pillars (around 30 cm high) of the array remain fixed in the ground.
