It is composed of neatly-built double-course slab walls (around 60 cm thick) containing variable-length (primarily 35 cm to 60 cm long) stones. These stones project as much as 20 cm above ground level. The south wall of the enclosure is well preserved and the west and north walls are partially intact, while most of the east wall has been destroyed. In the east wall, a large stone (55 cm long) runs perpendicular to the wall course. This stone appears to demarcate one side of a &lsquo;portal&rsquo; that punctuated the east wall. Lying outside the east wall, near the portal stone, a slab wall extends in an easterly direction for 2 m. Thin slabs of stones (15 cm to 30 cm long) were planted edgewise into the ground, in parallel courses, creating a wall 30 cm thick. <\/p> "},{"title":"Pillar","index":8,"parent_index":6,"body":null},{"title":"Notes","index":9,"parent_index":0,"body":null}]}
