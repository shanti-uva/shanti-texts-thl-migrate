It supported six rooms. Standing walls reach 1.4 m in height. An entranceway (1 m x 60 cm) between a northeast suite and a southeast suite of rooms is intact.

Its walls attain a maximum height of 1.6 m. A row of four rooms on the southwest end of the structure may have constituted a separate wing. It could not be determined whether there was a gap of 2 m or interconnecting walls between these four rooms and the rest of the structure. In the southwest group of rooms there is one intact entranceway (1.3 m x 90 cm). The main part of the edifice had no less than ten rooms. The southeast half of the main part of RS3 is in poor condition and its ground plan is no longer apparent. The northeast half of the main portion of RS3, however, is in much better shape. Small bits of the roofing still cling to the corners of its rooms. In the northeast part of the structure, five entranceways with their lintels (up to 1.5 m in length) intact are still in place. Two of these are external entrances on the upslope side of the edifice. All the entranceways of RS3 are 1.2 m to 1.3 m in height and 80 cm to 90 cm in width. In one of walls of a central room there is a small rectangular niche. On the west or upslope side of the main edifice what may have been an apron wall (4.7 m x 1.1 m x 1 m) creates a platform that extends into one of the rooms. <\/p> "},{"title":"Residential Structure RS4","index":10,"parent_index":6,"body":null},{"title":"Residential Structure RS5","index":11,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p>Residential structure RS5 (6 m x 7 m) is situated 6.8 m west of RS4 on the same shelf.
