It is comprised of five all-stone corbelled edifices built\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tentirely above the ground. These structures are in close proximity to <span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;nbu Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon bu rdo ring</span> (C-169), a cult site for the worship of the <span class=\"popular\">y&uuml;llha</span><span class=\"scholar\">Yul lha</span>. Due to the usage of relatively\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthin roof slabs, smaller and more delicate corbelling was installed as compared to many other <span class=\"popular emph\">do khang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rdo khang</span> sites. Entranceways tend to be relatively large, but there is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tno evidence for their having been windows in any of the structures. All structures are constructed of blue-gray\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmetamorphic slabs (10 cm to 80 cm in length) configured in heavily mud-mortared random-work courses. Walls average\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tonly 40 cm in thickness. Some walls are finely constructed of small slabs (10 cm to 25 cm long). None of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tedifices are aligned in the cardinal directions, nor is there structural evidence for hearths. As in other <span class=\"popular emph\">do khang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rdo khang</span>, ground plans consist of a multiple of small rooms\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twithout an obvious centralized space. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Certain morphological features of the <span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;nbu</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon bu</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstructures (above-ground aspect, larger and more intricately designed entryways, the light construction of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbuildings, and the relatively large size of one specimen) suggest that this site was founded at a later date\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(early historic period?) than some of Upper Tibet&rsquo;s other all-stone\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinstallations.
