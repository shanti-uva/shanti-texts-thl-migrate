The site occupies a narrow hanging valley called <span class=\"popular\">Mendhara<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Sman dha ra<\/span> (sp.?) situated at the eastern foot of the sacred mountain. It is comprised of five all-stone corbelled edifices built entirely above the ground. These structures are in close proximity to <span class=\"popular\">Mönbu Doring<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon bu rdo ring<\/span> (C-169), a cult site for the worship of the <span class=\"popular\">yüllha<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Yul lha<\/span>. Due to the usage of relatively hin roof slabs, smaller and more delicate corbelling was installed as compared to many other <span class=\"popular emph\">do khang<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rdo khang<\/span> sites. Entranceways tend to be relatively large, but there is no evidence for their having been windows in any of the structures. All structures are constructed of blue-gray metamorphic slabs (10 cm to 80 cm in length) configured in heavily mud-mortared random-work courses. Walls average only 40 cm in thickness. Some walls are finely constructed of small slabs (10 cm to 25 cm long). None of the edifices are aligned in the cardinal directions, nor is there structural evidence for hearths. As in other <span class=\"popular emph\">do khang<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rdo khang<\/span>, ground plans consist of a multiple of small rooms without an obvious centralized space. <\/p> <p>Certain morphological features of the <span class=\"popular\">Mönbu<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon bu<\/span> structures (above-ground aspect, larger and more intricately designed entryways, the light construction of the buildings, and the relatively large size of one specimen) suggest that this site was founded at a later date (early historic period?) than some of Upper Tibet’s other all-stone installations. Further archaeological research is needed, however, to confirm this hypothesis. Given the remote and lofty location of the site at the foot of an important regional sacred mountain, the <span class=\"popular\">Mönbu<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon bu<\/span> facility may have had a religious function. <\/p> "},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":" <p>According to inhabitants of <span class=\"popular\">Dungkar<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Dung dkar<\/span>, <span class=\"popular\">Mönbu<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon bu<\/span> was an ancient residential center.<\/p> "},{"title":"Site elements","index":6,"parent_index":2,"body":" "},{"title":"Residential Structure RS1","index":7,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p>Residential structure RS1 is situated 7.5 m north of <span class=\"popular\">Mönbu Doring<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon bu rdo ring<\/span>. This large structure is 22 m long, 3.7 m wide on its southwest side and 7 m wide on its northeast side. There are significant wall elevations (up to 1.8 m) all throughout the structure save for its northeast end. The southwest end of RS1 is only one room wide (rooms 1 to 3). Room 1 has its own independent entrance. Rooms 2 and 3 are internally connected through an entranceway (1.3 m x 1 m) with an intact lintel. The slightly rounded corners of the wall plates in rooms 1 to 3 are a telltale sign that they were capped by an all-stone roof. To the northeast of room 3 the structure widens to two rooms abreast. There appear to have been hree such pairs of rooms but the northeast extremity of the building is almost leveled. <\/p> <p>A <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma ṇi<\/span> wall with old inscribed plaques is situated 2.5 m southeast of RS1.

It supported six rooms. Standing walls reach 1.4 m in height. An entranceway (1 m x 60 cm) between a northeast suite and a southeast suite of rooms is intact. A stone slab (1.2 m x 50 cm) lying inside the structure was probably used in he construction of the roof.<\/p> "},{"title":"Residential Structure RS3","index":9,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p>Residential structure RS3 (12.7 m x 7 m) is situated 5.5 m northeast or upslope of RS2. Its walls attain a maximum height of 1.6 m. A row of four rooms on the southwest end of the structure may have constituted a separate wing. It could not be determined whether there was a gap of 2 m or interconnecting walls between these four rooms and the rest of the structure. In the southwest group of rooms there is one intact entranceway (1.3 m x 90 cm). The main part of the edifice had no less than ten rooms. The southeast half of the main part of RS3 is in poor condition and its ground plan is no longer apparent. The northeast half of the main portion of RS3, however, is in much better shape. Small bits of the roofing still cling to the corners of its rooms. In the northeast part of the structure, five entranceways with their lintels (up to 1.5 m in length) intact are still in place. Two of these are external entrances on the upslope side of the edifice. All the entranceways of RS3 are 1.2 m to 1.3 m in height and 80 cm to 90 cm in width. In one of walls of a central room there is a small rectangular niche. On the west or upslope side of the main edifice what may have been an apron wall (4.7 m x 1.1 m x 1 m) creates a platform that extends into one of the rooms. <\/p> "},{"title":"Residential Structure RS4","index":10,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p>Residential structure RS4 (5.5 m x 4.9 m) is located 65 m west of RS3 on a small shelf above the valley floor.

The walls of this room reach 1.5 m in height and its integral entranceway is 60 cm wide (opens internally to another room). A few small corbels and roof sheathing (up to 1.4 m in length) remain attached to the north wall of the northeast room. They cover about ¼ the total area of the room.
