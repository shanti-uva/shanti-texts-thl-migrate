Locally, the site is simply known as rdo ring. It is found in a region called <span class=\"popular\">Leyor</span><span class=\"scholar\">Las yor</span>. <span class=\"popular\">Doring Raktsuk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo ring rag gtsug</span> was established on the right side of the <span class=\"popular\">Yorchu</span><span class=\"scholar\">Yor chu</span> valley (which is about one-half km wide here), on a well-drained rocky plain that gently declines to the west. The <span class=\"popular\">Yorchu</span><span class=\"scholar\">Yor chu</span> watercourse is only some tens of meters away from the pillars and funerary structures. This is unusually close to a water source for this type of installation. The sacred mountain <span class=\"popular\">Lonpo Gangri</span><span class=\"scholar\">Blon po gangs ri</span>, located 45 km away, is visible from <span class=\"popular\">Doring Raktsuk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo ring rag gtsug</span>. The east-west alignment of his stretch of the <span class=\"popular\">Yorchu</span><span class=\"scholar\">Yor chu</span> valley is likely to have played a role in the placement of the site at this location. There is a <span class=\"popular emph\">drok pa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">’brog pa</span> seasonal encampment in the vicinity, but no permanent habitations. The enclosure was founded on a natural rise, adding to its overall elevation. There are about 30 in situ pillars erected in different groupings, many of which have a slim, graceful form. Three or four types of rock were selected for use as stelae at <span class=\"popular\">Doring Raktsuk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo ring rag gtsug</span>. </p> "},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":" <p>According to local sources, a primordial monument.</p> "},{"title":"Site elements","index":6,"parent_index":2,"body":" "},{"title":"Enclosure","index":7,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p>The enclosure is not well aligned in the compass points.

The two short wall sections, aligned at right angles, that form the sides of the ‘T’ are partially intact. The double-course walls (50 cm to 60 cm thick) of the enclosure contain uncut blocky stones of variable length (10 cm to 55 cm long). These pink and gray stones are either even with the ground level or project above it to a maximum height of 20 cm. Beginning in the middle of the east wall of the enclosure there is a double-course slab wall that extends 6.5 m to the east. This wall contains variable-length slabs (up to 60 cm long, 2 cm to 4 cm in thick), in parallel courses set about 30 cm from each other.
