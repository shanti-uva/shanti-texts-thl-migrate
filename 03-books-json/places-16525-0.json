On the top of this formation (45 m x 3 m to 24 m) which rises 50 m above the southwest side of the <span class=\"popular\">Rutok<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Ru thog<\/span> basin, there are the ruins of what appears to have been a fortress or palace. The <span class=\"popular\">Luring Nakha<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Lu ring sna kha<\/span> complex also extends to the inner or south side of the formation. The floor plan of most buildings indicates that they were built with timber roofs. <span class=\"popular\">Luring Nakha<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Lu ring sna kha<\/span> was one of four summit installations flanking the large, moist <span class=\"popular\">Rutok<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Ru thog<\/span> basin (see A-16, A-17 and A-93). The <span class=\"popular\">Rutok<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Ru thog<\/span> basin was and still is the most important agricultural pocket in the <span class=\"popular\">Rutok<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Ru thog<\/span> district.

Little mortar, however, is still left in the seams. Including the revetments, present-day structural elevations reach 4 m to 5 m in height. Revetments up to 3 m in height and freestanding walls 1 m to 1.5 m are commonplace. The highest or west portion of the summit is less than 3 m wide. It gradually widens to around 12 m in the middle and 24 m on its eastern extremity. The 50-cm to 70-cm thick walls were built with stones up to 60 cm in length. The exterior faces of the stones were cut flat. In the central section of the summit there are also a couple standing walls made of adobe blocks (50 cm x 20 cm x 10 cm). The adobe walls are up to 2 m in height, and consist of alternating courses of blocks set into the wall lengthwise and widthwise. These highly weathered walls are devoid of a mud veneer. In <span class=\"popular\">Rutok<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Ru thog<\/span>, adobe-block walls are not associated with archaic cultural sites. Below the east side of the summit there is a small ruined building.<\/p> "},{"title":"South structures","index":8,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p>Below the summit, on the south side of the formation, there are the carcasses of several small buildings adhering to near vertical rock faces. Their prominent apron walls and an elevated stone pathway connecting various ledges clad much of the south face of the formation in masonry. Underneath an elevated section of the pathway there is a narrow chamber capped by a stone containment (1 m thick), which is supported by six hardwood imbers (50 cm to 80 cm in diameter). A 5-m high retaining wall supports this section of the pathway, creating he narrow, concealed chamber below. The radiocarbon assaying of a timber overlying the chamber indicates this section of the <span class=\"popular\">Luring Nakha<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Lu ring sna kha<\/span> was constructed only 300 to 500 years ago. Below the foot of the formation, the pathway continues to be elevated as much as 1.5 m above the slope atop a prepared stone bed. On its approach to the south side of the formation, the 2-m wide, evenly graded path winds around the proximate hillside. It must have provided a rather grand entry to he installation. The lower end of the walkway falls away into steep, east-facing talus-covered slopes.<\/p> "},{"title":"North structures","index":9,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p>Just above the north foot of the formation there is a highly deteriorated building foundation. On ledges a few meters above it there are two other building foundations. Further up, about halfway to the summit, there is yet another demolished structure.<\/p> "},{"title":"Affiliated sites","index":10,"parent_index":2,"body":" "},{"title":"mKhar rtse","index":11,"parent_index":10,"body":null}]}
