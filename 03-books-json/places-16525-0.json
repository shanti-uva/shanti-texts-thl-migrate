Little mortar, \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thowever, is still left in the seams. Including the revetments, present-day structural elevations reach 4 m to 5 \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tm in height. Revetments up to 3 m in height and freestanding walls 1 m to 1.5 m are commonplace. The highest or \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twest portion of the summit is less than 3 m wide. It gradually widens to around 12 m in the middle and 24 m on \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tits eastern extremity. The 50-cm to 70-cm thick walls were built with stones up to 60 cm in length. The exterior \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfaces of the stones were cut flat. In the central section of the summit there are also a couple standing walls \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmade of adobe blocks (50 cm x 20 cm x 10 cm). The adobe walls are up to 2 m in height, and consist of \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\talternating courses of blocks set into the wall lengthwise and widthwise. These highly weathered walls are \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdevoid of a mud veneer. In <span class=\"popular\">Rutok</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ru thog</span>, adobe-block \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twalls are not associated with archaic cultural sites. Below the east side of the summit there is a small ruined \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbuilding.</p>\n"},{"title":"South structures","index":8,"parent_index":6,"body":"\n<p>Below the summit, on the south side of the formation, there are the carcasses of several small buildings \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tadhering to near vertical rock faces. Their prominent apron walls and an elevated stone pathway connecting \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvarious ledges clad much of the south face of the formation in masonry. Underneath an elevated section of the \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpathway there is a narrow chamber capped by a stone containment (1 m thick), which is supported by six hardwood \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttimbers (50 cm to 80 cm in diameter). A 5-m high retaining wall supports this section of the pathway, creating \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe narrow, concealed chamber below. The radiocarbon assaying of a timber overlying the chamber indicates this \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsection of the <span class=\"popular\">Luring Nakha</span><span class=\"scholar\">Lu ring sna kha</span> was \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconstructed only 300 to 500 years ago. Below the foot of the formation, the pathway continues to be elevated as \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmuch as 1.5 m above the slope atop a prepared stone bed. On its approach to the south side of the formation, the \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2-m wide, evenly graded path winds around the proximate hillside. It must have provided a rather grand entry to \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe installation. The lower end of the walkway falls away into steep, east-facing talus-covered slopes.</p>\n"},{"title":"North structures","index":9,"parent_index":6,"body":"\n<p>Just above the north foot of the formation there is a highly deteriorated building foundation.

It is perched on a limestone formation above mkhar rtse \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmtsho. Towering 40 m above the lake basin, this conterminous complex is comprised of the limestone \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trevetments and adobe block walls of substantial buildings. <span class=\"popular\">Kharts&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mkhar rtse</span> (Castle Peak) enjoys panoramic views in all directions. Access is via almost vertical \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\texpanses of rock, in keeping with its fortress attribution in the local oral tradition. The existence of small \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdefensive structures on ledges below the summit of this site is also a design trait of Upper Tibetan \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstrongholds. Nevertheless, the high elevation walls (up to 6 m), fairly large rooms and traces of red ochre \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttinting endow the site with architectural characteristics of Buddhist temples founded after \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe early historic period. Perhaps it represents the vestiges of a fortified palace with chapels. There is a \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsingle building on the west summit (6.3 m x 6.5 m), several structures on the central summit (15 m x 11) and \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tresidential remains on the lower east summit (16 m x 6m).
