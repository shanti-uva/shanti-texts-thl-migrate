Tibetans in Central Tibet tend to colloquially use a transliteration of the Chinese word <em>xiang<\/em> (<em>shang<\/em>; <em>zhang<\/em> in Amdo) to refer to a township.<\/p> <p class=\"Paragraph\">A township then consists of a number of villages (<em>grong tsho<\/em>, <em>cun<\/em>), one of which is called the “township seat.” A township seat is by definition a “village” rather than a “town,” since a township classifies a rural area.  If the county seat is officially rural rather than urban, such as in remote counties, then the county seat is also a township seat.   In colloquial Tibetan, the word “<em>shang<\/em>” is used most frequently to refer to the township seat in particular.  The township seat is frequently the same name as the township administrative unit, but in fact it is just as frequently named differently, despite Tibetans using the broader unit’s name colloquially often to refer to the seat.<\/p> <p class=\"Paragraph\">An \"urban area\" like Lhasa is also divided into \"towns\" and \"townships,\" but it also has \"urban subdistricts\" that functionally are like towns, but resemble neighborhoods.  For example, the Lhasa urban area which is about ten miles on each side has some urban subdistricts in the built up city part, and then some townships in the outer areas.<\/p>","title":"An Overview of Chinese Towns and Townships"}]}
