   "body": "<p> <span class=\"popular\">Khorbuk Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">’Khor sbug rdo ring</span> is located on the northwest edge of the vast basin, which opens on the west side of the <span class=\"popular\">Gotang Gangri</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sgo thang gangs ri</span> meridian range. The site is simply called <span class=\"popular\">Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo ring</span> and a proximate place <span class=\"popular\">Khorbuk</span><span class=\"scholar\">’Khor sbug</span>. From the site there are excellent views of the great meridian range to the east and south. The view to the west is cut by the ridge bounding the edge of the basin. The terrain is broad, level and gravelly. The isolated pillar is made of a gray igneous rock, is highly worn and hosts small bits of orange climax lichen. The tabular pillar is now 1.2 m in height and has a basal girth of 1.5 m. It is only 7 cm to 15 cm in thickness. Its broad sides are oriented north and south. Lying on the ground beside the pillar is its broken top, which is 40 cm long. It is reported that this monument was a victim of the Chinese Cultural Revolution. In a small stone crib, on the south side of the pillar, there are some old plaques inscribed with the <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma ṇi</span> mantra. The plaques are not well arranged and the site is generally neglected.</p>",
