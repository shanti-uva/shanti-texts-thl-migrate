Sangs rgyas bstan \u2019dzin (b.1929) was elected by secret lot as the 33rd abbot of sMan ri. He was elected without knowing while he was doing research in the University of Oslo. He therefore soon returned to India. His name was then changed to Lung rtogs bstan pa\u2019i nyi ma when he was enthroned as the abbot as the tradition requires. In 1969, he began to have an assembly hall built. Since then he devoted all his time to the monastic establishment. Over the years, the monastery developed enormously. In this he was supported by dPon slob Sangs rgyas bstan \u2019dzin (1912-1978), the senior teacher of sMan ri Monastery in Tibet and dPon slob bsTan \u2019dzin rnam dag (b.1926), the junior teacher of the same monastery. The latter then became the senior teacher in the monastery at Dolanji while dGe bshes gYung drung rnam rgyal was appointed as the junior teacher when the studies of philosophy and logic were established.
