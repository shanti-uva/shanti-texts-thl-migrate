Sangs rgyas bstan &rsquo;dzin (b.1929) was elected by secret lot\n                        as the 33rd abbot of sMan ri. He was elected without knowing while he was\n                        doing research in the University of Oslo. He therefore soon returned to\n                        India. His name was then changed to Lung rtogs bstan pa&rsquo;i nyi ma when he was\n                        enthroned as the abbot as the tradition requires. In 1969, he began to have\n                        an assembly hall built. Since then he devoted all his time to the monastic\n                        establishment. Over the years, the monastery developed enormously. In this\n                        he was supported by dPon slob Sangs rgyas bstan &rsquo;dzin (1912-1978), the\n                        senior teacher of sMan ri Monastery in Tibet and dPon slob bsTan &rsquo;dzin rnam\n                        dag (b.1926), the junior teacher of the same monastery.

Later dPon slob bsTan &rsquo;dzin rnam dag\n                        was succeeded by dPon slob &rsquo;Phrin las nyi ma as the senior teacher. </p>\n\n                     <p>The monastery consists of an assembly hall (&rsquo;du khang), the abbot&rsquo;s\n                        residence (bla brang), the library (dpe mdzod), residences of the monks,\n                        buildings with rooms for lectures and conferences.
