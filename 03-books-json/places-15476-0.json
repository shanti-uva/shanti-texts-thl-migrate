According to local oral history, Wencheng Gongzhu (in Tibetan: <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Gyaza Kongjo</span>, <em><span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">rgya bza' kong jo</span></em>, 628-680/2) founded the temple on her way from the Tang capital of Chang'an to <span class=\"place\" title=\"F637\">Lhasa</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"F637\">lha sa</span></em>), where she was to become an imperial consort of the first Tibetan emperor <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Songtsen Gampo</span> (<em><span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">srong btsan sgam po</span></em>). One of the many Wencheng Gongzhu sites in Eastern Tibet, the Wencheng Gongzhu Temple is an important site along the so-called \"Southern Route\" the Princess might have taken on her trip from Chang'an/Xian prior to 641. Recently, <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Trangu</span> Monastery (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">khra 'gu bkra shis bshad sgrub chos 'khor gling</span></em>) just south of <span class=\"place\" title=\"F1189\">Jyekundo</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"F1189\">skye rgu mdo</span></em>, Ch. Yushu) has administered the Wencheng Gongzhu Temple. In the <span class=\"tibtext\" title=\"Type ID here\">yu shul rdzong dgon sde'i lo rgyus mdor sdus</span>, under the entry for Trangu we find \"<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">rgya bza' kong jos 'phrul bzhengs su grags pa'i 'bis gyi [sic] rnam par snang mdzad</span></em>.\" The <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Bikyi Nampar Nangdzé</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">'bis kyi rnam par snang mdzad</span></em>) is the famous rock carving of Vairocana and inscription that has been studied by <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Nyagong Könchok Tseten</span> (<em><span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">gnya' gong dkon mchog tshe brtan</span></em>) and <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Padma Bum</span> (<em><span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">pad+ma 'bum</span></em>) (1988), Amy Heller (1994, 1997), Samten Karmay (1998), and Matthew Kapstein (2000).</p> <p>Karmay (1998:56-7) described the Wencheng Gongzhu temple as: \"The most holy place in the local area of <span class=\"place\" title=\"F1189\">Jyekundo</span> is no doubt the site of <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">'Bis rNam-snang gtsug-lag-khang</span>. It is situated in a rocky gorge known to the local people as <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">'Bis-khog</span>, tucked away under the overlapping of its low hill ridges at the mouth of the gorge as one enters from the main valley, called <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">dPal-thang</span>, to the south-west of <span class=\"place\" title=\"F1189\">Jyekundo</span>... <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">'Bis-khog</span> is situated at a distance of about 25 km from the town of <span class=\"place\" title=\"F1189\">Jyekundo</span> as one travels up the river <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">dPal-chu</span> which flows from the south northwards in the <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">dPal-thang</span> valley. The temple of <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">'Bis rNam-snang</span> in <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">'Bis-khong</span> is situated to the north of the stream. It stands close to and leaning directly against a very high hillside, a flat and vertical rock-face which serves as the back wall of the main temple building. It is on this rock-face that we find carved in relief (<span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">'bur du dod pa</span>) a seated figure identified as <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Thub-pa gangs-chen mtsho-rgyal</span> i.e. a form of Buddha Vairocana in normal human size, and flanked on either side by eight standing figures, four on the right, two above and two below, and four on the left in the same fashion. The main figure is seated on a lotus throne supported by two lions back to back. Each figure is identified by the name in Tibetan engraved on the rock just beside its pedestal....\"</p> <p>This rock carving is certainly ancient. However, based on the rock inscriptions at the site, most authors doubt Wencheng's involvement and prefer to date the entire complex to 806 during the reign of Emperor <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Tridé Songtsen</span> (<em><span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">khri lde srong btsan</span></em>). Karmay (59) speculates that the present association with Wencheng can be traced in large part to a 1958 propagandistic pilgrimage guide written by a <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Sakya</span> (<em><span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">sa skya</span></em>) monk, <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Sanggyé Gyatso</span> (<em><span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">sangs rgyas rgya mtsho</span></em>), for the purposes of heralding ethnic unity. However, he does admit that there are several other Vairocana rock-carvings in Eastern Tibet, which had been attributed to Wencheng over 300 years ago (64-65). At the time of writing, Karmay reported <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Sanggyé Gyatso</span>'s pilgrimage guide, \"<span class=\"tibtext\" title=\"Type ID here\">Mdo stod gnas chen 'bis rnam snang zhes lha cig rgya bza' kong jos brkos pa'i dkar chag don bzhin ston pa'i zhal lung</span>,\" was no longer available. <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Nyagong Könchok Tseten</span> and <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Padma Bum</span> quoted parts of the guide in their article.</p> ","title":"An Introduction to the Vairocana/Wencheng Gongzhu Temple"},{"title":"Bilbiography","index":1,"parent_index":0,"body":" <p><span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">gnya' gong dkon mchog tshe brtan</span> and <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">pad+ma 'bum</span>. 1988. yu shul khul gyi bod btsan po'i skyabs kyi rten yig brag brkos ma 'ga'.<em> <span class=\"tibtext\" title=\"Type ID here\">krung go'i bod kyi shes rig</span></em>, 4: 52-75.</p> <p>Heller, Amy. 1994. \"Ninth-Century Buddhist Images Carved at Ldan-ma-brag to Commemorate Tibeto-Chinese Negotiations.\" In <em><span class=\"tibtext\" title=\"Type ID here\">Tibetan Studies</span>, </em>ed. Per Kvaerne.
