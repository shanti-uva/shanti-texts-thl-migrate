The site faces east over an area of rich winter pasturage known as <span class=\"popular\">Yangd&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">G.yang sde</span>. The single all-stone edifice was constructed on a steep rocky\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tslope and is aligned in the cardinal directions. It appears to have consisted of three tiers of small rooms (about\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tone dozen in total). The strongly built structure was primarily constructed from red sandstone laid in random-work\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcourses with a red mud mortar applied to the seams. Most of the lower walls of the edifice have been leveled\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tprecluding a detailed assessment of its ground plan. Walls are around 70 cm thick and contain variable sized\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstones (20 cm to 70 cm long).

Only the footings of the forward wall of the edifice are\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstill intact. The forward or lower tier (around 3.9 m wide) of this<span class=\"popular emph\">do khang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\"> rdo khang</span> is set at two different elevations. The upper section (1.5 m wide) of the forward\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttier may have been part of an axial corridor. The middle tier of the edifice is 3.2 m wide and the third or upper\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttier is 2.4 m wide. A 5-m long wall segment (up to 1.8 m in height) separates the middle and upper tiers. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsouth room (2 m x 1.7 m) of the upper tier is largely intact, the only room in <span class=\"popular\">Purbu Gyangmar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Phur bu gyang dmar</span> to be so. The lintel (at least 1.1 m long) over the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\teast-facing doorway of this room is still in place. Rubble filling the upper tier south room comes to within 1.2 m\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the ceiling. The all-stone ceiling assembly forms a corbelled pseudoarch that projects 70 cm above the rest of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe roof line. This is the only corbelled pseudoarch of its type surveyed to date in Upper\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTibet. From the top of the side walls, this beehive-shaped arch (spanning an area of 1.4 m x 1.6 m)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttapers inwards toward the apex of the roof until it is only about 30 cm wide. Stones cap the opening in the top of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe arch. The stones making up the interior of the arch are covered in sediment and a black organic growth. A\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsmall north wall fragment in the upper tier is also extant (80 cm long, 90 cm high). In addition to red sandstone,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthere are a few conglomerate blocks in this north wall fragment. The remainder of the rear tier north room has\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcollapsed as has most of the rest of the building. There is, however, a single in situ south wall fragment (2 m\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlong, 50 cm high). </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Directly below the <span class=\"popular\">Purbu Gyangmar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Phur bu gyang dmar</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"popular emph\">do khang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rdo khang</span> at the foot of the slope, three sides of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tquadrate stone enclosure (4.8 m x 5.3 m) are in place. It was built with blue limestone, red sandstone and a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconglomerate. The fragmentary walls of this superficial structure are around 60 cm thick. Its function is unknown.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOn the edge of a shelf, 28 m up slope of the <span class=\"popular emph\">do khang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rdo khang</span>,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthere are the faint remains of a platform-like structure. At the same elevation 93 m to the south, is a much\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbetter preserved structure probably of the same type (2.1 m x 1.9 m x 60 cm). It is oriented to the angle of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tslope rather than the compass points. This structure is probably an archaic shrine and is robustly constructed of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tred sandstone slabs (up to 1 m long) and large chunks of limestone. Presently, its forward wall is elevated 60 cm\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tabove the surface (its original height is not known), while its rear wall is flush with the slope. A similar but\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnot as well-preserved structure (2 m x 2.1 m) is situated 50 m downhill. This more lightly-constructed structure\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(made from the same kinds of rocks) rises 50 cm above the lower slope and is flush with the uphill slope. Stones\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\theaped upon it appear to be the remains of a superstructure. On the next slope, immediately south of a small\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgully, there are the faint remains of what might have been another vertically aligned row of shrines. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Affiliated sites","index":7,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>At the foot of the slope just south of <span class=\"popular\">Purbu Gyangmar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Phur bu gyang dmar</span> there are the remains of a small red sandstone house with two walled courtyards.
