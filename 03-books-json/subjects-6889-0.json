   "body": "<p>\"Tenement or Residential yard\" is used as a particular building type within the <em>Lhasa Atlas</em> by Knud Larsen and Amund Sinding-Larsen. In the \"Historical buildings in Lhasa\" table at the back of the book (pp. 165-172), buildings of the \"Tenement or Residential yard\" type are designated with the letter \"I\" in the building type column. In the THL Place Dictionary, when a building has this feature type and the<em> Lhasa Atlas</em> is given as the source, it means that the building was designated with a \"I\" in the <em>Lhasa Atlas</em> table.<br/><br/>This building type is described as follows:<br/><br/>\"<em>I. Residential yard (or building)</em>. Example: Delin Khangsar (106).<br/><br/>\"The residential or tenement yard in old Lhasa is clearly an urban creation. Originally, it was privately owned by rich monasteries or the government, and built to generate rental income as well as to provide much needed housing. Unlike most other buildings, the residential yard is normally asymmetrical, built to fit the given site configuration. It is often an assembly of small, terraced and uniform two- or three-stroey townhouses. A common courtyard provides access to a well and latrines\" (p. 61).<br/><br/>Source:<br/><br/>Larsen, Knud and Amund Sinding-Larsen. <em>The Lhasa Atlas: Traditional Tibetan Architecture and Townscape</em>.
