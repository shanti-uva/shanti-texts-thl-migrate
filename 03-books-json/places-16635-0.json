It appears to have been the social and ritual nucleus of the site. Its dimensions are as follows: 11 m (southeast wall), 12 m (southwest wall), 13.4 m (northwest wall), and 7.4 m (northeast wall). It consists of two wings of rooms set behind an east-facing courtyard. The courtyard is 6.8 m long on its north side and 4.3 m long on its south side. The walls enclosing the courtyard are double-coursed, around 50 cm thick and a maximum of 1.5 m high. The entrance to the courtyard is in the east. <\/p> <p>The north wing of the building consists of a row of four rooms: northeast, central east, central west, and west. The northeast room (exterior dimensions: 2.7 m x 3 m, interior dimensions: 2 m x 2.2 m, floor-to-ceiling height: 1.7 m) still has a fully intact roof, complete with a smoke hole. Stone slabs are piled up around the smoke hole and could have been manipulated to regulate the draft. The entrance (90 cm x 60 cm) to the 2-m high northeast room is in the south. There are three small niches in the west wall and one niche in the east wall of the room. There are traces of the mud plaster that originally covered the interior walls. Corbels project about 20 cm from all four walls. There are two corbels on all but the west wall, which only has one. The diagonally-oriented bridging stones are up to 1.2 m in length. On the south side of the roof there is a parapet wall that extends about 20 cm above the rest of the northeast room. The fact that the northeast room is the only fully intact structure at rdo rta sga as well as the crude, incongruous construction of the upper courses of stonework and arrested corbelling technique used, indicates that the northeast room was rebuilt at some point in time, probably by religious practitioners. <\/p> <p>The south side of the central east room (1.7 m x 80 cm) has largely collapsed. Its south entrance was about 80 cm in height. Against the north wall there is a structural extension (1.6 m x 1.4 m) with a small entrance or opening. This sheltered space must have had a storage or specialized ritual function. The west central room (2.4 m x 1.8 m) is now largely filled with earth. Although its entrance (approximately 80 cm high) has been largely destroyed, the 1.3-m long overarching lintel is still in situ. There is a niche in the west wall. The west\/rear room (3.2 m x 2 m) of the north wing of RS2 was accessed via the central west room. The entranceway between them is 60 cm wide. Above the fully underground rear wall of the west rear room there are the remains of a parapet, adding 30 cm to its height. Some corbels still rest on top of the walls in the central west and west rear rooms. The floor-to-ceiling height of the west room is 1.6 m. There are three large subterranean recesses in the rear wall of the west room, which must have had a special religious function (perhaps related o the worship of chthonic spirits). These three recesses are elevated 10 cm to 30 cm above the floor of the west room. The north recess measures 50 cm x 70 cm x 70 cm. The inner portion of the central recess is slightly elevated above the outer half. Some red ochre still stains the mud plaster of the central recess (70 cm x 90 cm x 1.4 m). In the rear of the south recess (60 cm x 80 cm x 1.5 m) there is a small niche. <\/p> <p>The south wing (5.4 m x 2.9 m) of RS2 appears to have contained a total of four more rooms. The two forward rooms have been largely destroyed. These two rooms were deeply set behind or to the west of the northeast room of the edifice. The rear south and rear north rooms of the south wing have partially intact roofs. The rear south room has a floor-to-ceiling height of around 1.4 m, while the rear north room has been partially engulfed by rubble. The south corner of the rear\/west wall of RS2 is elevated 1 m above ground level. The rear north room of the south wing opens directly to the north wing. <\/p> "},{"title":"Residential Structure RS3","index":10,"parent_index":7,"body":" <p>Residential structure RS3, located 3.6 m south of RS2 at the same elevation, has been mostly destroyed. It measures 6.5 m (north-south) x 3.7 m (east-west). The rear\/west has a maximum height of 1.6 m, 40 cm of which is above ground level. The south wall (5 m long) of the courtyard has partly survived. <\/p> "},{"title":"Residential Structure RS4","index":11,"parent_index":7,"body":" <p>Residential structure RS4 is situated 6.7 m south of RS3 (10.29&#900; \/ 05.17&#900; \/ 4600 m). RS4 measures 9 m (north-south) x 5.5 m (east-west). This structure has been razed and turf grows within the ruins. As with RS3, he ground plan of RS4 is no longer discernable. There is a lone in situ corbel on the north wall (maximum height: 1.3 m). The west wall has a maximum height of 1.3 m on the exterior side and 1 m on the interior. There is a small aperture near ground level in the west wall.<\/p> "},{"title":"Shrine complex","index":12,"parent_index":7,"body":null},{"title":"Residential Structure RS5","index":13,"parent_index":7,"body":" <p>Residential structure RS5 (4 m x 4.5 m) is situated higher up on the backbone of the island (10.27&#900; \/ 05.20&#900; \/ 4610 m). It was built into an almost vertical slope. A cave (4.3 m x 3.2 m) was cut out of the conglomerate formation directly behind the structure. In the rear of the cave there is a stone and adobe hearth and platform. A black substance is peeling from the side of the platform. The cave ceiling is not fire-blackened; it seems that the original ceiling has fallen away. RS5 probably contained four rooms: two forward and two rear. The rear east room is directly conveyed to the cave. The lintel over the entranceway (90 cm x 50 cm) to he cave is still in place. An entranceway with a red sandstone lintel 1.2 m long divides the forward west room from the two rear rooms. Between the two rear rooms there is a buttress (80 cm thick, 1.1 m high) extending 1.1 m from the formation. The interior dimensions of the rear west room are 1.2 m x 2 m. The size of he rear east room is not clear. The two forward rooms have been largely destroyed. The exterior side of the forward wall of RS5 attains a height of 3 m, while its interior is only 80 cm high. This difference in height is accounted for by the revetment upon which the superstructure sits. About 1 m above RS5 a stone course is embedded in the rim of the cliff. Adjacent to RS5 in the east there is an enclosure (3.6 m x 4 m). There are also the remains of a perimeter wall on the north and east sides of RS5. <\/p> "},{"title":"Minor shrines","index":14,"parent_index":7,"body":" <p>On a narrow east-facing bench there is a rectangular shrine that directly overlooks the eastern cape of the island (10.16&#900; \/ 05.41&#900; \/ 4600 m). This ceremonial structure is aligned in the cardinal directions (2.7 m x 2 m x 1.4 m). It was built of variable-length uncut blocks of stone (up to 60 cm long) and has a random-rubble exture. Its foundation contains larger stones. Immediately to the south is a smaller shrine (90 cm x 1 m x 80 cm). The exterior walls of the smaller shrine are made of flatter stones (up to 40 cm long), while the interior is filled with small stones (5 cm to 15 cm long). <\/p> "},{"title":"Residential Structure RS6","index":15,"parent_index":7,"body":" <p>Residential structure RS6 is built against the island&rsquo;s backbone directly west of the eastern cape (10.15&#900; \/ 05.41&#900;). This relatively large edifice is generally aligned in the cardinal directions and measures 13.5 m (east-west) x 6.6 m (north-south). It was built in four distinct elevations: lower\/east (4.5 m wide), lower central (3.5 m wide), upper central (1.8 m wide), and upper\/west (3.7 m wide). The two lower levels comprise a wo-tiered open courtyard. A wall 80 cm high separates the two tiers of the courtyard. The perimeter wall around the courtyard is partially intact. <\/p> <p>The two upper tiers of RS6 make up the building itself. The upper central tier is raised about 60 cm above he courtyard. Its northern portion has been reduced to rubble, but on its south side there is a small room with two in situ corbels and a niche in the west wall. The upper\/west tier of RS6 is divided into south and north units, each containing a forward room and a rear room. The entrance to the upper tier was via an extension of the courtyard. The upper tier is elevated about 60 cm above the upper central tier. The forward wall of the upper tier is around 1.5 m high, 90 cm of which is freestanding. The interior dimensions of the south unit are 3.3 m (east-west) x 2 m (north-south). The south wall (up to 1.6 m high) of the south unit has wo in situ corbels. In the west wall of the rear room of the south unit there are one or two niches, and mud plaster still sticks to the walls. On the wall dividing the rear and forward rooms of the south unit several corbels are in place. The interior dimensions of the north unit of the rear tier are 3.4 m (east-west) x 2.5 m (north-south). Its forward wall is mostly missing but there is one in situ corbel on the north wall and one on he west wall of the forward room. Along the wall plates of the rear room of the north unit both corbels and bridging stones are still in place. Rubble including roof appurtenances (up to 1.1 m long) partially fill the rear room. The rear\/west wall of RS6 is built 1.5 m into the ground. <\/p> <p>Adjacent to the south side of RS6 there are two low-lying wall sections enclosing a space measuring 7.5 m (north-south) x 10 m (east-west). On the southern edge of the same bench there is a shrine (10.10&#900; \/ 05.46&#900; \/ 4600 m). Not much of this ceremonial structure (3.2 m x 1.7 m) is integral.
