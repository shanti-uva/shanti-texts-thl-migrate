The quality and size of the residential\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tarchitecture located here indicates that this 2-km long island was an elite cultural and economic center.

Residential structures RS1 and RS6 have outlying positions, while RS2, RS3, RS4, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRS5 were raised in close proximity to one another. RS2, RS3 and RS4 in particular appear to have formed an\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tintegral residential cluster. These structures are primarily built of bluish and brownish metamorphic rocks of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvariable length (up to 70 cm long) laid in random-rubble courses. Mostly red and brown sandstone was employed\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfor the bridging stones and roof sheathing. The corbels tend to be thicker and made from another type of rock.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe corbelling tends to have short projections from the wall plates and was installed more sparingly than at\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsome <span class=\"popular\">do khang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo khang</span> sites. Rather, much of the roof\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tassembly is comprised of successive layers of oversailing bridging stones spanning most of the space between\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\topposing walls. There is evidence of a mud-based mortar being used but most of it has washed out from the walls.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOrange climax lichen clings here and there to the walls. These extremely durable structures would have enabled\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe occupants of the facility to store surplus food grains and ample material possessions. The majority of food\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsupplies, tools, fuel, and other goods came from the productive lands of the mainland.

The courtyard entrance is in the east near the north wall, which\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\textends 1 m farther east than the south wall.

Stone slabs are piled up around the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsmoke hole and could have been manipulated to regulate the draft. The entrance (90 cm x 60 cm) to the 2-m high\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnortheast room is in the south. There are three small niches in the west wall and one niche in the east wall\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the room. There are traces of the mud plaster that originally covered the interior walls. Corbels project\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tabout 20 cm from all four walls. There are two corbels on all but the west wall, which only has one. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdiagonally-oriented bridging stones are up to 1.2 m in length. On the south side of the roof there is a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tparapet wall that extends about 20 cm above the rest of the northeast room.

This sheltered space must have had a storage or specialized ritual function. The west central room\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(2.4 m x 1.8 m) is now largely filled with earth. Although its entrance (approximately 80 cm high) has been\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlargely destroyed, the 1.3-m long overarching lintel is still in situ. There is a niche in the west wall.

Some corbels still rest on top of the walls in the central west and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twest rear rooms. The floor-to-ceiling height of the west room is 1.6 m. There are three large subterranean\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trecesses in the rear wall of the west room, which must have had a special religious function (perhaps related\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto the worship of chthonic spirits). These three recesses are elevated 10 cm to 30 cm above the floor of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twest room. The north recess measures 50 cm x 70 cm x 70 cm. The inner portion of the central recess is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tslightly elevated above the outer half.

This conduit is not well centered north-south, and the nature of its enshrining function is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tenigmatic. An earthen structure (structure S2) that has been reduced to a shapeless heap (1.5 m long, 1.2 m\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thigh) is situated 70 cm to the south. Adjacent to the south side of the adobe structure there is a rectangular\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmasonry structure (structure S3) with a <span class=\"popular emph\">Ch&ouml;rten</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mchod rten</span>-like\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tquality (4.4 m x 2.4 m x 1.7 m). Three graduated tiers appear to be discernable. There is a small opening on\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tits north side and perhaps two more on the east side of S3. These openings access an interior cavity spanned\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tby sandstone members. There appears to be quite a bit of earth inside this shrine, which is probably the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tremains of internal structures. There is another masonry ceremonial structure (structure S4), situated 90 cm\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\teast of S3 (1.2 m x 1 m x 1.4 m). S4 has apertures near the top of its east and west faces that access an open\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinterior. On the top of S4 there is a lone brown sandstone plaque with the following Bon\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmantras carved on it: <span class=\"popular emph\">a a karsa len&ouml;</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">a a dkar sa le &rsquo;od</span>, <span class=\"popular emph\">a yang om du</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">a yang o&#7747; &rsquo;du</span>, and <span class=\"popular emph\">a om hum</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">a o&#7747; hum</span> written vertically.

It was built into an almost vertical slope. A cave (4.3 m x 3.2 m) was cut out of the conglomerate\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tformation directly behind the structure. In the rear of the cave there is a stone and adobe hearth and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tplatform. A black substance is peeling from the side of the platform. The cave ceiling is not fire-blackened;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tit seems that the original ceiling has fallen away. RS5 probably contained four rooms: two forward and two\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trear. The rear east room is directly conveyed to the cave. The lintel over the entranceway (90 cm x 50 cm) to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe cave is still in place. An entranceway with a red sandstone lintel 1.2 m long divides the forward west\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\troom from the two rear rooms. Between the two rear rooms there is a buttress (80 cm thick, 1.1 m high)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\textending 1.1 m from the formation. The interior dimensions of the rear west room are 1.2 m x 2 m. The size of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe rear east room is not clear. The two forward rooms have been largely destroyed. The exterior side of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tforward wall of RS5 attains a height of 3 m, while its interior is only 80 cm high. This difference in height\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tis accounted for by the revetment upon which the superstructure sits. About 1 m above RS5 a stone course is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tembedded in the rim of the cliff. Adjacent to RS5 in the east there is an enclosure (3.6 m x 4 m).

This relatively large edifice is generally aligned in the cardinal directions and measures 13.5 m\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(east-west) x 6.6 m (north-south).
