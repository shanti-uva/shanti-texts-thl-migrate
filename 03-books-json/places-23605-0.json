History","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":" <p>The first master of the sNang zhig lineage of sNang zhig Monastery (No.180) in rNga khog, Do ’phags chen po (b.1028), had three sons: Nyi ma ’dzin, ’Dul ba rgyal mtshan and gYung drung rgyal mtshan (alias Shes rab ’od zer), the younger brothers, migrated to Shar khog. There ’Dul ba rgyal mtshan established a family considered sacred (gdung brgyud) with the name of lCags mdud situated to the east of the river and below the village of A gling. The family temple which he built became his main residence and was called sNang zhig lCags mdud dgon (NKhGL p.99). Later the temple was extended into a small monastery. The family was famous for its possession of an old silver image of the Bonpo sage Dran pa nam mkha’ known as lCags mdud dngul sku, “the Silver image of the lCags mdud family”. gYung drung rgyal mtshan, the brother of ’Dul ba rgyal mtshan, died at the age of twenty-four leaving two sons: gYung drung bstan pa’i rgyal mtshan and bSam ’grub. While the elder brother looked after the monastery and the younger brother ensured the lineage’s continuity.<\/p> <p>Shar khog is an area where Bon religion has always been the dominant tradition and where the gdung brgyud system has been the most prevalent. However, in the recent times there were interruptions in the line of the family and the monastery has made great effforts to reestablish the hereditary succession.<\/p> <p>In 1938, with the help of the local people, lCags mdud Nyi ma bstan ’dzin (1898-1953) moved the monastery to sNa steng and so it became known as sNa steng Monastery. Later lCags mdud sKal bzang rgyal mtshan (1922-1978) took charge of the monastery. The monastery was destroyed during the Cultural Revolution and the present head of the monastery is lCags mdud Zla ba rgyal mtshan (b.1951). He took the initiative to rebuild it in the 1980s. gYung drung nyi ma (b.1973) acts as teacher in the new monastery.<\/p> "},{"title":"4.
