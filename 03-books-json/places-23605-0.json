There &rsquo;Dul ba rgyal mtshan\n                        established a family considered sacred (gdung brgyud) with the name of lCags\n                        mdud situated to the east of the river and below the village of A gling. The\n                        family temple which he built became his main residence and was called sNang\n                        zhig lCags mdud dgon (NKhGL p.99). Later the temple was extended into a\n                        small monastery. The family was famous for its possession of an old silver\n                        image of the Bonpo sage Dran pa nam mkha&rsquo; known as lCags mdud dngul sku,\n                        &ldquo;the Silver image of the lCags mdud family&rdquo;. gYung drung rgyal mtshan, the\n                        brother of &rsquo;Dul ba rgyal mtshan, died at the age of twenty-four leaving two\n                        sons: gYung drung bstan pa&rsquo;i rgyal mtshan and bSam &rsquo;grub. While the elder\n                        brother looked after the monastery and the younger brother ensured the\n                        lineage&rsquo;s continuity.</p>\n\n                     <p>Shar khog is an area where Bon religion has always been the dominant\n                        tradition and where the gdung brgyud system has been the most prevalent.\n                        However, in the recent times there were interruptions in the line of the\n                        family and the monastery has made great effforts to reestablish the\n                        hereditary succession.</p>\n\n                     <p>In 1938, with the help of the local people, lCags mdud Nyi ma bstan &rsquo;dzin\n                        (1898-1953) moved the monastery to sNa steng and so it became known as sNa\n                        steng Monastery. Later lCags mdud sKal bzang rgyal mtshan (1922-1978) took\n                        charge of the monastery.
