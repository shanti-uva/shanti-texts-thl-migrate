To the west, the site is closely bound by the ridge hat encloses the basin. There are wide views in all other directions. The well-drained terrain is nearly level, sandy and gravelly. <span class=\"popular\">Doring Barma<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo ring bar ma<\/span> consists of a large funerary mound (<span class=\"popular emph\">bangso<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">bang so<\/span>) and at least one other funerary structure. In close proximity there is a shepherd\u2019s camp with a few small corrals, which is occupied in the springtime. Many of the walls of the funerary structures were dismantled in order to build this camp. Uncut beige and reddish volcanic (?) stones of variable length (15 cm to 60 cm long) were used to construct he archaeological structures. Stones are scattered all around the site, detritus from the funerary monuments. There is a spring in the vicinity, a fairly unusual occurrence at ancient funerary sites.

It measures 14 m (north-south) x 15.5 m (east-west), and is elevated 1.5 m to 2 m above the surrounding terrain. In the middle of he top of the tumulus there is a stone-filled depression. This shows that, at some time in the past, FS1 was opened by vandals. Just below the rim of the mound there are double-course wall fragments (around 40 cm thick). Such walls must have lined each side of the structure. The longest of these double-course wall fragments (2.3 m) runs along the west rim of the structure. There is also a small fragment of a herringbone wall course on one flank of the mound, indicating that it once boasted extensive and elaborate stonework. Below the north and west sides of the mound are remnants of slab and block walls. These constitute ancillary funerary structures whose configuration is no longer discernable. The longest of these outlying wall segments (3 m long, 40 cm thick) is found to the north of the mound. This north-south oriented, double-course wall is composed of blocks laid flat on the ground. A few old plaques inscribed with the <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma \u1e47i<\/span> mantra have been placed on the mound.
