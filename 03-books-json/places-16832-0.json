To the west, the site is closely bound by the ridge\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat encloses the basin. There are wide views in all other directions.

In close proximity there is a shepherd&rsquo;s camp with a few small corrals, which is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\toccupied in the springtime. Many of the walls of the funerary structures were dismantled in order to build this\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcamp. Uncut beige and reddish volcanic (?) stones of variable length (15 cm to 60 cm long) were used to construct\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe archaeological structures. Stones are scattered all around the site, detritus from the funerary monuments.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThere is a spring in the vicinity, a fairly unusual occurrence at ancient funerary sites. The name suggests that\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tat one time there was one or more standing stones at <span class=\"popular\">Doring Barma</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo ring bar ma</span>, but evidence of their existence was not discovered.

It measures 14 m\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(north-south) x 15.5 m (east-west), and is elevated 1.5 m to 2 m above the surrounding terrain. In the middle of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe top of the tumulus there is a stone-filled depression. This shows that, at some time in the past, FS1 was\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\topened by vandals. Just below the rim of the mound there are double-course wall fragments (around 40 cm thick).\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSuch walls must have lined each side of the structure. The longest of these double-course wall fragments (2.3 m)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\truns along the west rim of the structure. There is also a small fragment of a herringbone wall course on one\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tflank of the mound, indicating that it once boasted extensive and elaborate stonework. Below the north and west\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsides of the mound are remnants of slab and block walls. These constitute ancillary funerary structures whose\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconfiguration is no longer discernable. The longest of these outlying wall segments (3 m long, 40 cm thick) is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfound to the north of the mound.

A few old plaques inscribed with the <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma &#7751;i</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmantra have been placed on the mound.
