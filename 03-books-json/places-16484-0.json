The hill is not impregnable, in that access along its western and southern approaches is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trelatively easy. The strength of the geographic setting comes from the fact that it is highly isolated (it is far\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tremoved from other archaic residential sites as well as modern centers of settlement). There are the ruins of some\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t60 formidably constructed buildings at dbang phyug mgon po mkhar. Many of these structures\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twere two or even three stories in height. Covering an area of nearly 6000 m&sup2; (118 m x 49 m), Castle of dbang phyug mgon po is one of the largest citadels surveyed\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto date. Most structures were built of random-work masonry, using a light-colored mud-based mortar adhesive. Roofs\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twere mainly constructed with stone corbels fitted into socket-holes upon which timbers must have rested. In some\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinstances, a band supported by corbels was constructed to act as a load-bearing structure for the timbers of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\troof. A single <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma &#7751;i</span> wall and a type of shrine are found north of the castle complex. These\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBuddhist structures appear to have been constructed at a much later date.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>According to local sources, dbang phyug mgon po was the powerful <span class=\"popular emph\">d&uuml;</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">bdud</span> demon ruler of the region. He came under attack by a Tibetan\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBuddhist army who laid siege to his castle. For a few months the castle withstood the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tassault, but its water supply was finally extinguished. Not wanting to let this vital fact to be known to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTibetans, <span class=\"popular\">Wangchuk Gonpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dbang phyug mgon po</span> ordered that his troops smear butter on their hair to simulate that they had just bathed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis ruse had the intended effect and the Tibetan king believed that the castle still possessed ample water\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\treserves. Not willing to wait much longer, the Tibetan king wanted to storm the castle but his army had used up\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir salt supply. Consequently, retreat was imminent. That night, the great VajrayAna adept \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"popular\">Guru Rinpoch&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ru rin po che</span> (eighth century) \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmanifested in the dream of the Tibetan king as two yellow ducks and led him to a nearby salt mine. The next\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmorning, using the geographic cues provided in his dream, a minister of the Tibetan king was able to find the salt\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmine. The attack of the castle could now go ahead and it proved successful, leading to the defeat of the <span class=\"popular emph\">d&uuml;</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">bdud </span>king. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Site elements","index":6,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Fortress","index":7,"parent_index":6,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The legend claiming that Castle of <span class=\"popular\">Wangchuk G&ouml;npo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dbang phyug mgon po</span> belonged to the <span class=\"popular emph\">d&uuml;</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">bdud</span> (a class of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tindigenous demon/deity) suggests that it was part of the archaic cultural infrastructure of the region.

Its great elevation is another\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tindication of considerable antiquity, as no major facilities in Upper Tibet\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twere built at 5000 m in the historic epoch. Another indication pointing to an archaic cultural\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\torigin is the lack of Buddhist monuments contemporaneous with Castle of <span class=\"popular\">Wangchuk G&ouml;npo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dbang phyug mgon po</span>. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The main collection of buildings at Castle of dbang phyug mgon\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpo is found on a limestone outcrop. Other structures are scattered below on the south flank of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thill. The citadel seems to have been built with locally quarried limestone cut into flat blocks 40 cm to 1 m in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlength. The upper walls of a few buildings were constructed of rammed-earth. Wall elevations of 2 m to 4 m are\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcommon throughout the site, and the tallest extant fragments reach 8 m. The highest rammed-earth segment is 5 m.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWall thickness ranges between 50 cm and 80 cm. Buildings that may have had relatively large halls are located in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe upper northwest corner of the site. All entranceways appear to have been built with stone lintels, many of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhich are still in situ. These doorways are only 50 cm to 70 cm in width. At the junction of the ground and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfirst floors of buildings square socket-holes are in evidence, some of which still have stone corbels inserted\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin them. These structural elements were employed to support the flooring of the first story. The roofs must have\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen built in a similar fashion, using sockets and corbelling. The corbels are not massive (around 5 cm thick)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand project a maximum of 50 cm from the walls. Given these dimensions and the wall spans involved, the floors\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand roofs could only have been made of timbers and not with heavy stone members. No pieces of wood, however,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twere recovered from the site. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>In the lower west sector of the complex there is a passageway (interior dimensions: 2.7 m x 50 cm) with an\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tall-stone corbelled roof, built under a larger room. Another similarly constructed passageway lies adjacent to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tit, but it is filled with rubble and only a few corbels remain in place. In the lower central sector there is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\talso an alcove (interior dimensions: 80 cm x 1.3 m) with an all-stone roof, which is part of the lower level of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ta building. On the west side of the hill, below the main group of ruins, there are three narrow\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsemi-subterranean rooms that also appear to have had all-stone roofs. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<hr class=\"footnote-divider\" />\n"},{"title":"Notes","index":8,"parent_index":0,"body":"\n<div class=\"footnote\">\n<a name=\"n31\" />\n<a href=\"#nb31\" class=\"note\">\n\t     \t\t\t\t[31] </a> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBellezza, <span class=\"popular emph\">Zhang Zhung</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">Zhang zhung</span>.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n"}]}
