Located southwest of <span class=\"popular\">Khyunglung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Khyung lung</span> village, access to he <span class=\"popular\">Marchö</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mar mchod</span> valley is gained by way of a 4500-m high pass known as <span class=\"popular\">Yarkhala</span><span class=\"scholar\">Yar kha la</span>. The lone pillar of <span class=\"popular\">Marchö Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mar mchod rdo ring</span> stands in close proximity to a winter pastoral camp of the same name. It is anchored on a 10° slope covered in sparse grass and pebbles. The four-sided pillar is 2.5 m in height and has a basal girth of 1.2 m. The four sides of the stone are quite evenly hewn and are fairly closely oriented in the compass points. <span class=\"popular\">Marchö Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mar mchod rdo ring</span> is slightly inclined but still well rooted in the ground. It has stood for a long time as evidenced by the wear it has undergone and by the way it has turned from beige to a reddish and dark brown color due to geochemical weathering processes. The original function of <span class=\"popular\">Marchö Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mar mchod rdo ring</span> could not be ascertained. </p>
