In the \"Historical buildings in Lhasa\" table at the back of the book (pp. 165-172), buildings of the \"Temple or chapel\" type are designated with the letter \"B\" in the building type column. In the THL Place Dictionary, when a building has this feature type and the <em>Lhasa Atlas</em> is given as the source, it means that the building was designated with a \"B\" in the <em>Lhasa Atlas</em> table.<br /><br />This building type is described as follows:<br /><br />\"<em>B. Temple or chapel</em>. Example: Lukhang chapel (317).<br /><br />\"Smaller temples are often built in special places for special purposes. A small number of resident caretaker monks or nuns from the overseeing monastery take turns being responsible for the temple's upkeep\" (p. 60).<br /><br />Source:<br /><br />Larsen, Knud and Amund Sinding-Larsen. <em>The Lhasa Atlas: Traditional Tibetan Architecture and Townscape</em>.
