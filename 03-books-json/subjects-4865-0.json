   "body": "<p>This refers to the four interpretive parts of an Indian commentary or Tibetan text: the topic (བརྗོད་བྱ་), purpose (དགོས་པ་), final purpose (སྙིང་དགོས་ or དགོས་པའི་དགོས་པ་), and relationships between them (འབྲེལ་བ་). If these occur as a separate chapter-level element in the front section, then enter them as such in the catalog record; however, if they are part of the first chapter, then do not enter them as a separate section. Example: for the text Abhisamayālaṁkara (མངོན་རྟོགས་རྒྱན་), the topic is the 8 categories (དངོས་པོ་བརྒྱད་); the purpose is obtaining the four preparations/applications in dependence upon studying the eight categories (དངོས་པོ་བརྒྱད་ལ་སློབ་སྦྱོང་བྱེད་པ་ལ་བརྟེན་ནས་སྦྱོར་བ་བཞི་ཐོབ་པ་); the final purpose is attaining the state of a Buddha (མཐར་སངས་རྒྱས་ཀྱི་གོ་འཕང་ཐོབ་པ་); the relationships are these: by studying the topic (the eight categories), one attains the four preparations/applications (this is the purpose), and attainment of the four preparations/applications is necessary for the attainment of Buddhahood (the final purpose).</p>",
