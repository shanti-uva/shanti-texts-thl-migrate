George Roerich (Roerich, <em>Trails to Inmost Asia</em>, 416, 417) reports that his father Nicholas found several graves near\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir camp, which was in a side glen known as Ratri. These graves are described as\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbeing enclosed by stones arranged in a square. The graves are said to be laid out east-west. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRoerich account also states that a large boulder stood on the eastern extremity of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthese graves. He hypothesized that the heads of the corpse pointed east. Roerich believed\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat these graves probably date to the <span class=\"emph\">Neolithic</span>, and that they were chronologically\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trelated to the megalithic monuments of the region. Ratri is stated to be 22 miles\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsouthwest of the megalithic site of Do-ring. On March 24, the RCAE traveled around the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnorth side of <span class=\"popular\">Gomang Tso</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sgo mang mtsho</span> (Roerich, <em>Trails to Inmost Asia</em>, 418). Ratri is described by Roerich as a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlocale with granite slopes. Ratri can be confidentially identified with <span class=\"popular\">ratra</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ra gra</span> (sp.?) (31&deg; 19.1&#900; N. long / 89&deg; 15.1&#900; E. long. /\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t4680 m), a location approximately 2 km downstream of <span class=\"popular\">Sangkhar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bsang mkhar</span> (this general area is dominated by granite formations). Inquiries with local <span class=\"popular emph\">drok pa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">&rsquo;brog pa</span> revealed that there is no other place in the <span class=\"popular\">Gomang Tso</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sgo mang mtsho</span> basin with a name that is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tphonetically similar to &lsquo;Ratri&rsquo;. It was also determined that there were no funerary\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstructures in <span class=\"popular\">ratra</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ra gra</span> proper.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRoerich&rsquo;s Do-ring has been pinpointed as <span class=\"popular\">Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo ring</span> (South) (31&deg; 22.7 N. lat. / 89&deg; 26.0 E.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlong.), situated 25 km (as the crow flies) northeast of <span class=\"popular\">ratra</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ra gra</span> (see C-162). It should be noted that the distance given by Roerich\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbetween these two points represents the ground covered by the RCAE overland through rugged mountainous\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tterrain. While the funerary structures (they also could have ritual functions aside from burial) of <span class=\"popular\">ratra</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ra gra</span> do not securely date to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"emph\">Neolithic</span>, they do certainly belong to the archaic cultural horizon of Upper Tibet.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIt should also be observed that only FS1 possibly has a large headstone on the east side of the structure.
