A number of naturally occurring boulders were incorporated into the perimeter walls. Some of the boulders on the enclosure may also have been moved into their current positions. There are stones piled up on he inner side of the largest of these boulders (3.3 m long). This pile appears to be the vestiges of a shepherd’s shelter (<span class=\"popular emph\">droklhé</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">’brog lhas</span>). Like FS2, there is a gap in the east wall of the FS1 enclosure. This may be a deliberate design trait (as is found in some enclosures hat house pillars). The large boulders notwithstanding, variable-length (10 cm to 1.3 m long) stones were used make the perimeter walls. In some places, small stones were placed on top of larger stones. These walls appear o have been crudely built with no particular order or arrangement. Many of the stones of FS1 host orange climax lichen growth. The uphill/north wall of FS1 is constructed of heaped stones. This wall has a maximum interior height of 50 cm and a maximum exterior height of 1.4 m, in order that the interior of the enclosure could be relatively level. The downhill/south wall also consists of stones laid on top of one another. It is raised 20 cm on its interior side and 70 cm on its exterior side; also to compensate for the slope gradient. There are loose rocks scattered around the enclosure as well as some partially submerged ones. </p>",

This structure may once have been taller, but it has been subject to heavy erosion and possible geomorphologic modification. On the west side of the perimeter there is what appears to be a double-course wall fragment (60 cm thick). There is a gap in the east wall. Variable length (10 cm to 70 cm) stones were used in he construction of the FS2 enclosure. The interior of the enclosure is moderately sloping and contains some exposed and partially submerged stones. </p>",
