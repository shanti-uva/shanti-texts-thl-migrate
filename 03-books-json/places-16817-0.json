This structure may once have been taller, but it has been subject to heavy erosion and possible geomorphologic modification. On the west side of the perimeter there is what appears to be a double-course wall fragment (60 cm thick). There is a gap in the east wall. Variable length (10 cm to 70 cm) stones were used in he construction of the FS2 enclosure. The interior of the enclosure is moderately sloping and contains some exposed and partially submerged stones. <\/p> "},{"title":"Funerary Structure FS3","index":9,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p>Funerary structure FS3 (6 m x 6 m) is situated 28 m downhill of FS2.

The perimeter walls of FS3 are level with the ground surface or rise above it to a maximum height of 30 cm. The same variable-length stones found in FS2 were used to construct FS3.
