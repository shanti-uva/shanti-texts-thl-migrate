A number of naturally occurring boulders were incorporated into the perimeter walls. Some of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tboulders on the enclosure may also have been moved into their current positions. There are stones piled up on\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe inner side of the largest of these boulders (3.3 m long). This pile appears to be the vestiges of a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tshepherd&rsquo;s shelter (<span class=\"popular emph\">droklh&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">&rsquo;brog lhas</span>). Like FS2, there is a gap\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin the east wall of the FS1 enclosure. This may be a deliberate design trait (as is found in some enclosures\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat house pillars). The large boulders notwithstanding, variable-length (10 cm to 1.3 m long) stones were used\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmake the perimeter walls. In some places, small stones were placed on top of larger stones. These walls appear\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto have been crudely built with no particular order or arrangement. Many of the stones of FS1 host orange climax\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlichen growth. The uphill/north wall of FS1 is constructed of heaped stones. This wall has a maximum interior\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\theight of 50 cm and a maximum exterior height of 1.4 m, in order that the interior of the enclosure could be\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trelatively level. The downhill/south wall also consists of stones laid on top of one another. It is raised 20 cm\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ton its interior side and 70 cm on its exterior side; also to compensate for the slope gradient. There are loose\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trocks scattered around the enclosure as well as some partially submerged ones. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Funerary Structure FS2","index":8,"parent_index":6,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Funerary structure FS2 (14 m x 10 m), the highest specimen at <span class=\"popular\">Shongdo Ra</span><span class=\"scholar\">Shong rdo ra</span>, is situated 147 m east of FS1 (49.175&#900; / 03.278&#900; / 4900 m).
