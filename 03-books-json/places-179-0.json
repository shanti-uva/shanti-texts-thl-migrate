The matter was settled\n                        through offers of compensation: firstly, by offering the lady Kong bza&rsquo; khri\n                        lcam to sTon pa gShen rab as his wife; secondly, by offering bushels of gold\n                        and turquoise; and thirdly, Kong rje, the king of the demons, offered\n                        himself and his subjects, who then became sTon pa gShen rab&rsquo;s\n                        attendants.&rdquo;</p>\n\n                     <p>sTon pa gShen rab then buried many treasures, including the gold and\n                        turquoise he received, at the foot of the craggy hills that looked like\n                        scattered jewels, so that they would be the essence of the soil of the four\n                        quarters of Tibet. Saying prayers to the nectar-producing bough of Kong\n                        btsun De mo, he thrust it into the ground there as a sign of eternity.</p>\n\n                     <p>On top of Mount gNyan, he also planted a juniper tree as tall as himself,\n                        where handprints of his four distinguished disciples still remain. The tree\n                        is called sKu tshad sku shug ldem drug. </p>\n\n                     <p>He preached the Bon of the Nine Vehicles and he, himself being the lord of\n                        the dMu lineage, identified a mountain and gave it the name dMu ri smug po.\n                        This is the central peak of Mount Bon ri. The summit is also called lHa ri\n                        gyang tho. He entrusted the local deities who reside on various peaks to\n                        guard the treasures he had concealed: gYung drung lha gnyan rtsal as the\n                        guardian of treasure in the centre, Gangs gnyan stag rtse as the king of the\n                        east, Nyang lha btsan drug as the king of the north, bDud nag rngams sgra\n                        sgrogs as the king of the west and gYu &rsquo;od sman btsun as the goddess of the\n                        south. Kong btsun De mo is the overall protectress of the place and rDzu\n                        &rsquo;phrul klu dbang is the special protector of treasures.</p>\n\n                     <p>The sacred mountain Bon ri and its surroundings became a centre of the\n                        teachings of Bon. gNya&rsquo; khri btsan po is said to have descended from the sky\n                        onto the summit lHa ri Gyang tho. He was the first king of Tibet. Co&rsquo;u and\n                        &rsquo;Tshe mi were the first religious attendants of the king; between them and\n                        the king there was the &ldquo;priest-patron&rdquo; relationship. The king and his\n                        religious attendants resided at the foot of Mount dMu ri smug po and\n                        inspired the spreading of the Bon teachings.</p>\n\n                     <p>Since then a number of the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">gshen</span> religious\n                        practitioners have come up to this holy place and established places for\n                        religious practice. dMu ri smug po, the main peak of Mount Bon ri, is the\n                        very highest among the peaks, which include lHa ri Gyang tho, Nor bu ri and\n                        gShen ri bde ldan. On the slopes and in the valleys of Mount Bon ri, there\n                        were the following religious sites: Srid rgyal, sTag bro sa, dGyes ri, dGon\n                        rnying, Srin mo phug, dBus phug, Yang dben, Bya de phug, lHa ri Gyang tho,\n                        gSang gling, Phug gu, Nyi ma phug, sNang ngog, Thugs dkar brag, Brag dkar\n                        zhabs rjes, rDzong chung steng, Shel sku sbug and the cemetery Mi yul skyid\n                        mthing. Mount Bon ri is, therefore, not only a special place for the Bonpo,\n                        but Buddhists as well, who join in its veneration.</p>\n\n                     <p>Mount Bon ri still receives a stream of pilgrims who accumulate merit by\n                        making circumambulations and many prostrations. Mount Bon ri and its\n                        surroundings present unearthly scenery, with the beautiful high mountains\n                        filled with pine trees, bamboo, medicinal herbs, flowers, herbivores and\n                        various kinds of birds.</p>\n\n                     <p>There were periods of great celebration in the vicinity of the mountain. One\n                        of the major festivities in a cycle of twelve years was an event called\n                        Nyang po lha gsol, held in the tiger year, from the 1st to the 8th day of\n                        the eighth month. During this period, people got together in the seven Bonpo\n                        monasteries, including sNang ngog, and went through the ceremonies, true to\n                        the time-honoured tradition, of initiation, the fortune-call ritual and\n                        religious dances. The lay folk also performed dances, horse-racing,\n                        horseback archery and the fortune-call parade.</p>\n\n                     <p>In the mouse year, on the 8th day of the eighth month, there was the\n                        performance of the fortune-call ceremony by the religious practitioners, and\n                        dances and songs by the lay folk, as in the case of the tiger year. The\n                        origin of this festival goes back to a Bonpo hermit:</p>\n\n                     <p>In the Sixth Rab byung (1327-1386) a lama of Shel zhig from the Khams\n                        province rediscovered a crystal image of sTon pa gShen rab called Dri med\n                        shel sku, in the place called Shel sku sbug, and took it back to Khams.\n                        Similarly, three text-rediscoverers from Khyung po found, in Thugs dkar\n                        brag, a conch believed to be self-grown from the teeth of sTon pa gShen rab\n                        and took it back to Khyung po. Following that, in Kong po, a mountain\n                        crumbled, rainfall became rare, fields produced little harvest, disease\n                        spread among people and cattle, famine struck and many other disasters\n                        ensued, which reduced the people to a state of helplessness. During this\n                        time, the hermit dPon gsas Ri pa &rsquo;brug gsas was in meditation at the cave\n                        Thod g-yu phug in Nying khri. The hermit understood the reason for the\n                        disasters and said, &ldquo;The fertility of the soil had been weakened because of\n                        the excavation of the treasures, the image Dri med shel sku and the tooth\n                        conch.&rdquo; He therefore made the people perform the ritual of propitiation\n                        dedicated to the local deities and the fortune-call ceremony. When these\n                        ceremonies ended, rain began to fall, people had a good harvest and the\n                        epidemic abated.</p>\n\n                     <p>The local people propitiated the goddess Srid pa rgyal mo in her various\n                        aspects: at Srid rgyal Monastery, it was dKar mo Srid rgyal; at rDzong chung\n                        steng Monastery, sMug mo Srid rgyal; and at sTag bro sa, Srid rgyal drel\n                        nag. The people of the three villages of Nya mgor propitiated the goddess A\n                        ma Yu mo. They also kept the tradition of performing the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">bsang</span> ritual on the 15th and 30th of every month at different\n                        sacred sites of Mount Bon ri where there were special signs, such as\n                        footprints of early sages on rocks. This holy mountain, to which all\n                        devotees pay homage and make pilgrimages, is one of the most important\n                        religious sites in the world and, as such, it is well known.</p>\n\n                  \n\n                  \n\n                     "},{"title":"(88) Srid rgyal Monastery","index":4,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n\n                     <p>Srid rgyal dgon chen is situated close to Nying khri rdzong, halfway up the\n                        holy mountain Bon ri.

A\n                        historical document states:</p>\n\n                     <p>&ldquo;In the land called Bon ri</p>\n\n                     <p>There will be a hermit named &rsquo;Brug gsas</p>\n\n                     <p>Who will possess a &lsquo;magic-stone&rsquo;,</p>\n\n                     <p>Will be courageous and avert wars,</p>\n\n                     <p>And guide 300,000 people to salvation.</p>\n\n                     <p>Anyone who contacts him will be rewarded.&rdquo;</p>\n\n                     <p>This hermit was born in 1270 in rDza rong into the clan of sMa ra. sMa ra is\n                        a subdivision of the clan Rang bya. He was the second son of dKon cog dge,\n                        the father, and A lcam U gu, the mother. Having been in religious service\n                        until the age of thirteen years, he was given the name &rsquo;Brug gsas rgyal.\n                        From the time he was fourteen until he was nineteen years of age, he\n                        practised meditation. He then listened to various masters in China, &rsquo;Jang\n                        and Mi nyag. He then became conscious of the impermanence of life. He\n                        therefore travelled to Central Tibet and began to practise more meditation,\n                        as well as to perform circumambulation around sacred sites such as Ti se, Ma\n                        pang, Bye ma g-yung drung and sPos ri ngad ldan. He then travelled down to\n                        Kong po in accordance with a prophecy of Srid pa rgyal mo. In 1330, he\n                        &ldquo;opened the door of Bon ri&rdquo; (that is to say, he identified the mountain),\n                        because people had forgotten the fact that the place was one of the\n                        thirty-seven religious centres of Bon. This was due to the long period of\n                        time that passed since sTon pa gShen rab&rsquo;s visit to the place and also due\n                        to the chequered history of the Bon religion.</p>\n\n                     <p>&rsquo;Brug gsas took up residence in the cave gYu phug, near which the three\n                        streams of Nyang meet. He remained there in meditation for three years and\n                        countenanced deities of tranquil and wrathful aspects from whom he received\n                        more prophecies. He was able to make the eight kinds of demons serve him.\n                        While devoting himself to retreat-practice of Khro bo and Phur pa on the\n                        mountain, he received signs from the goddess dKar mo Srid rgyal for founding\n                        a monastery at this place. He therefore founded Srid rgyal Monastery there.\n                        The interior and exterior of the monastic buildings were of good design and\n                        their religious contents were rich.
