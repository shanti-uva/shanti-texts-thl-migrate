Before 1959 there were fifteen monks, but\n                        at present no more than ten. Although this is an old monastery with a long\n                        three-hundred-year history, it is still very small. Its religious objects\n                        include the following: seven statues, tall and short, of sTon pa gShen rab\n                        and Dran pa nam mkha&rsquo;; forty thangka; and several books.</p>\n\n                     <p>For their source of income, as in other Bonpo monasteries, the monks depend\n                        on the support of households and earn money by performing religious services\n                        among the people in the villages.
