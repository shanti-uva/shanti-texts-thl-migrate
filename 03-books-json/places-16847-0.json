They were built from pieces of a local,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdark-brown blocky rock (primarily 20 cm to 60 cm long).

Funerary structures FS1,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFS2, FS3, FS4, and FS5 form a meandering 32 m long north-south aligned line of structures, situated at the same\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgeneral elevation.

FS1 was built on the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trocky ridgeline. It is situated so that the views to the south and west are mostly blocked. </li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Funerary structure FS2 is so highly deteriorated that it is barely recognizable. The views south and east\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tare also cut from this ridgeline structure. </li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Funerary structures FS3, FS4, FS5, FS6, and FS7 are located in a shallow hollow, sandwiched between two\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsmall rocky crests. These structures have constricted views in all directions. Funerary structures FS3, FS4 and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFS5 have been reduced to a few in situ foundation stones. Funerary structure FS6 has been almost leveled as\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twell.</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Funerary structure FS7 (2.5 m x 2.5 m) has been gutted, thus nothing of the central depository (reliquary)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tremains (51.599&#900; / 46.584&#900;). The inside of the exterior walls reaches 90 cm in height. The inner wall\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconstruction reveals that these structures were well built, like most other sites of the typology.</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Funerary structures FS8 and FS9 are located 30 m west of FS7, in a smaller hollow (51.589&#900; / 46.596&#900; / 4840\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tm). FS8 is now nothing more than a rocky pit, 1.3 m deep and 3.5 m across. FS9 has been reduced to its\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfoundation. These two structures are so deteriorated that they could not be positively identified as cubic\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttombs. Old wall traces of a probable ritual function circumscribe the hollow as well. </li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ol>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Affiliated sites","index":7,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"rDo ring","index":8,"parent_index":7,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>About one-half km north of <span class=\"popular\">Dr&ouml;nchung</span><span class=\"scholar\">&rsquo;Bron chung mon dur</span>, in a gully at the foot of the ridge, there are two pillars (31&deg; 51.882&#900; N. lat. / 81&deg; 46.704&#900;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tE. long.).
