According to one of the legends, after the decline of a Bonpo monastery founded by Khod po Blo gros thogs med (1280-1337) at lCang lo sna in rTa’u, several of its elder monks went to the sacred mountain rBa zhabs brag dkar and founded a hermitage there which later developed into a monastery. According to the other legend, a Bonpo saint called Nam mkha’ snang mdog from rGyal rong founded gSang phug, a hermitage on the same sacred mountain that gradually expanded into a monastery known by the same name. </p><p>The monastery was looked after by the descendants of Khod po Blo gros thogs med. Later ’Gro mgon Tshe dbang ’gyur med, ’Go mgon Shes rab dgongs rgyal, ’Gro mgon gYung drung tshul khrims, Nam mkha’ rgyal mtshan and Nam mkha’ bsam ’grub gave teachings at the monastery. It seemed to have enjoyed a long period of prosperity that ended when a group of local Buddhist chiefs who envious of the monastery’s wealth hired a gang of thieves to ransack and burn down the monastery. </p><p>Many years later, during the dGe lugs pa persecution when many Bonpo monasteries in the area were force to disband, rDza dGe sprul Yid bzhin legs ’grub, undaunted by the dGe lugs pa sectarian policy, went to Dartsedo to obtain permission to rebuild at least one Bonpo monastery. He combined nine Bonpo monasteries together into one and called it dGu rdza dgon, the “Nine Monasteries in the Clay Mountain”. After that, it was maintained by gYung drung rgyal mtshan and Byams pa ’phrin las for many years. It was wrecked during the Cultural Revolution and was rebuilt and resumed its religious activities in the 1980s. </p>",
