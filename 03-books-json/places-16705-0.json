There are two small pillars and the vestiges of funerary enclosures at the site. <span class=\"popular\">Lhalung Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Lha lung rdo ring</span> has been heavily impacted by grazing and the recent construction of corrals. What remains of he monuments is threatened by continued pastoral activities.</p>

Only one enclosure has been spared from utter destruction. It is located 50 m northwest of the two pillars. The single-course rectangular perimeter measures 2.4 m x 1.7 m. Its walls contain stones 20 cm to 40 cm in length, which are mostly even with the ground surface. This enclosure is not oriented in the cardinal directions. Recently, stones have been extracted from this structure and it is in imminent danger of annihilation. Local <span class=\"popular emph\">drok pa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">’brog pa</span> do not appear to be aware of the identity of this structure.
