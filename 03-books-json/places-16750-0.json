Only small fragments of the walls of the enclosure have endured. The enclosure is so degraded that the composition of its walls is no longer discernable, but they are most likely to have been double-course. A grayish and brownish metamorphic (?) rock of variable length (20 cm to 70 cm long) was used to construct the enclosure. In order to maintain a level interior, the east wall of the enclosure is elevated about 50 cm above the downhill slope. There is a well-centered opening (75 cm wide) in the east wall, which is demarcated by two large stones that are set perpendicular to the wall course. These threshold stones are 80 cm long with a maximum projection of 40 cm from the ground surface and 50 cm long with a 20 cm projection. There is virtually nothing left of the west wall. It appears to have been laid within 1 m of the pillars. There is also very little remaining of the south and north walls of the enclosure. Many smaller stones (5 cm to 15 cm long) are scattered about the interior of the enclosure. These stones must have been an integral part of the structure at one time. </p> "},{"title":"Pillars","index":8,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p>There are three pillars inside the enclosure, the middle one being the tallest among them. These pillars are grayish to brownish in color and are heavily worn and darkened. The pillars have the following dimensions and characteristics:</p> <p>South pillar: a metamorphic rock of four uneven sides, (70 cm [height] x 1.1 m [basal girth]). Just north of the south pillar there is a small broken pillar (20 cm x 70 cm).</p> <p>Central pillar: a sedimentary tabular rock whose broad sides are oriented north and south, (1.6 m x 1.3 m). The central pillar is situated 1.4 m north of the south pillar.</p> <p>North pillar: a gray crystalline irregularly shaped rock (80 cm x 1.6 m).
