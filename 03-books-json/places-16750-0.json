Only small fragments of the walls of the enclosure have endured.

In order to maintain a level interior, the east wall of the enclosure is elevated about 50 cm above\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe downhill slope. There is a well-centered opening (75 cm wide) in the east wall, which is demarcated by two\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlarge stones that are set perpendicular to the wall course. These threshold stones are 80 cm long with a maximum\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tprojection of 40 cm from the ground surface and 50 cm long with a 20 cm projection. There is virtually nothing\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tleft of the west wall. It appears to have been laid within 1 m of the pillars. There is also very little\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tremaining of the south and north walls of the enclosure. Many smaller stones (5 cm to 15 cm long) are scattered\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tabout the interior of the enclosure.
