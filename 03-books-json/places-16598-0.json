Although this site is highly degraded, it appears to have once been the focus of \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsignificant settlement. The structural dispersion covers an area of 30 m x 70 m, and extends 10 m up the slope \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbounding the right side of the <span class=\"popular\">Gekh&ouml; Kharlung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ge khod mkhar lung</span> valley. At the bottom end of the site there is a group of corrals built deeply into the slope. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThey were created from old buildings, some of the footings of which exist in the walls of the livestock pens. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThese corrals no longer seem to be in use. The upper part of the site consists of no less than 12 collapsed or \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpartly collapsed caves, which had been hewn from the earth and rock of the slope. At the mouth of a few caves are \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttraces of masonry fa&ccedil;ades. The caves appear to have been relatively small in size.</p>\n"},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n<p>According to some <span class=\"popular\">Rutok</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ru thog</span> natives, <span class=\"popular\">Gekh&ouml; Kharlung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ge khod mkhar lung</span> (Lower) was an ancient <span class=\"popular\">Kel M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Skal mon</span> residential site.</p>\n"},{"title":"Affiliated sites","index":6,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n"},{"title":"East residential structure","index":7,"parent_index":6,"body":"\n<p>In the first side valley, east or upstream of the <span class=\"popular\">Gekh&ouml; Kharlung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ge khod mkhar lung</span> citadel, there is another building foundation (33&ordm; 20.8΄ N. lat. / 79&ordm; 44.8΄ \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tE. long / 4420 m). This very poorly preserved structure (8 m x 12 m) is found on a moderate slope squeezed \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbetween two gullies. It appears that this was once a substantial edifice.

So little evidence remains that their existence could not be positively established.
