Although this site is highly degraded, it appears to have once been the focus of significant settlement. The structural dispersion covers an area of 30 m x 70 m, and extends 10 m up the slope bounding the right side of the <span class=\"popular\">Gekhö Kharlung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ge khod mkhar lung</span> valley. At the bottom end of the site there is a group of corrals built deeply into the slope. They were created from old buildings, some of the footings of which exist in the walls of the livestock pens. These corrals no longer seem to be in use. The upper part of the site consists of no less than 12 collapsed or partly collapsed caves, which had been hewn from the earth and rock of the slope. At the mouth of a few caves are traces of masonry façades. The caves appear to have been relatively small in size.</p> "},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":" <p>According to some <span class=\"popular\">Rutok</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ru thog</span> natives, <span class=\"popular\">Gekhö Kharlung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ge khod mkhar lung</span> (Lower) was an ancient <span class=\"popular\">Kel Mön</span><span class=\"scholar\">Skal mon</span> residential site.</p> "},{"title":"Affiliated sites","index":6,"parent_index":2,"body":" "},{"title":"East residential structure","index":7,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p>In the first side valley, east or upstream of the <span class=\"popular\">Gekhö Kharlung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ge khod mkhar lung</span> citadel, there is another building foundation (33º 20.8΄ N. lat. / 79º 44.8΄ E. long / 4420 m).

The present-day seasonal agricultural village of <span class=\"popular\">Gekhö Kharlung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ge khod mkhar lung</span> may also have obscured traces of earlier settlement.

The presence of arable land in the valley adds to the likelihood that it has long been a focus of sedentary settlement.</p>  "}]}
