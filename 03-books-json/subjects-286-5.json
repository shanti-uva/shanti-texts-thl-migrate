However, this does not mean that liturgical and philosophical languages have a separate grammar.<span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\"> ཆོས་སྐད་</span> is in fact pure Literary Tibetan, using a philosophical terminology that is specific to Dharma.</p> <p class=\"Paragraph\">Oral religious teachings are normally given in the vernacular language, usually Spoken Standard Tibetan, fully complemented with quotations in Literary Tibetan. It is sometimes said that some lama has been giving teachings in a Kham or Amdo dialect. In fact this happens when lamas are at home, but it is rare when they teach Dharma outside their native region. In that case they use the Standard Spoken language mixed with Literary Tibetan, and pronounce the words with an accent of their native dialect.</p> <p class=\"Paragraph\">The use of Classical Tibetan as a liturgical language is widespread even outside the Tibetan-speaking world, particularly in Mongolia and in the Russian Federation in Buriatia, Tuva, and in Khalmykia. It is also sometimes used by various ethnic groups of Nepal such as Tamangs, Manangis, Lepchas, Gurungs, etc.</p> <p class=\"Paragraph\">It should be noted that the term <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ཆོས་སྐད་</span> is sometimes also used for political reasons in order to avoid mentioning the word “Tibetan,” which refers to a nation and may therefore be less than ideal in a religious context. Finally, one occasionally hears the term <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ཆོས་སྐད་</span> used to refer to the common language spoken in large monasteries that house monks of diverse regional provenance.</p>","title":"The Language of Dharma"}]}
