It is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tperched on the top of a badland crest at a significantly higher elevation. As such, ha la mkhar\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t (East) enjoys much more panoramic views than its counterpart. Both <span class=\"popular emph\">khar</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mkhar</span> of <span class=\"popular\">Hala</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ha la</span> are in eyeshot of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tone another. ha la mkhar  (East) is of a particular design found only at two other sites in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"popular\">Gug&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ge</span>: Little Castle (<span class=\"popular\">Kharchung</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mkhar\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tchung</span>) (A-136) and ma nam mkhar  (West) (B-77). This earthen structure is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcomposed of three parallel rows of tiny compartments. This edifice is likely to have functioned as a fortress or\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\treligious center, an installation that required many rooms (probably for the billeting of personnel). The higher,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmore difficult location of ha la mkhar  (East) may mean that it was a defensive bulwark\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst a fiercer, more persistent or wider-ranging enemy than those faced by ha la mkhar\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t (West). At any rate, it exhibits a very different design pattern than the neighboring residential\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfacility. This singular structure measures 32 m (north-south) x 14 m (east-west), and appears to have been built\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof adobe blocks. The very small size of the compartments and their relatively large number (around 18 in total) is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnot in keeping with the spatial arrangement of Buddhist monasteries in <span class=\"popular\">Gug&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ge</span> nor elsewhere in Tibet. There is no permanent source\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof water at ha la mkhar  (East) and this essential commodity must have been hauled up from\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe valley below. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Evidently none exists in the locale.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Site elements","index":6,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Castle","index":7,"parent_index":6,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tha la mkhar  (East) appears to have contained three rows of rooms with at least six rooms\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin each, which are oriented along the east-west axis of the structure. The south and north rows of compartments\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tare set at a lower elevation than the middle or summit portion of the edifice. Very little of the ground plan\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tremains in place and, due to the advanced level of degradation, the interface between the building and formation\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tis not very clear in certain places. This extremely dissolved structure was probably built of adobe blocks. Had\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tit been constructed of rammed-earth, traces of the orifices used in the assembly of the shuttering, should still\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbe visible. Some of the light-colored mud walls are set on 50-cm high stone foundations. Below the summit, on\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe south side of the structure, there is a line of at least six rooms poised above the precipitous slopes of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe formation. These rooms were divided by both stone and adobe partitions. In one room with standing wall\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsegments (up to 1.2 m in height), the rear wall and one side wall are made of stone while the other side wall is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof adobe. Each room in this row measures 2.5 m in width (east-west). The length of the south facing rooms is no\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlonger determinable because their forward sections have slipped down the mountainside. The south line of rooms\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdoes not extend all the way to the east and west extremities of the remaining portion of the structure.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInterposed between the summit row and south row of compartments there is a terrace or corridor (1 m to 1.5 m\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twide). </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>There also appears to have been a row of rooms along the north side of the structure, with a passageway between\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tit and adjoining summit portion of the edifice, creating a symmetrical ground plan. The north line of rooms,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thowever, is even more deteriorated than the south row. In the west half of the north row, some traces of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpartition walls are evident, while much of the east half of the row has disappeared down the slopes. Through\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\terosive forces the summit portion of the building has been largely leveled. Small wall segments (up to 1.5 m in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\theight) that abut the summit side of the two axial corridors have persisted. There is also an isolated interior\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twall partition (1.5 m high), which managed to remain standing in the middle of the summit. All other traces of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe summit row of rooms have been washed away. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Affiliated sites","index":8,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Ha la Buddhist ruins","index":9,"parent_index":8,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>In the bottom of the <span class=\"popular\">Hala</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ha la</span> valley, there are a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnumber of ruined <span class=\"popular emph\">ch&ouml; ten</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mchod rten,</span> made with adobe blocks\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand wooden superstructures.
