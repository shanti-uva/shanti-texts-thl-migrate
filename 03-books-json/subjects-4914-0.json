<p class=\"Paragraph\">The individually named urban districts are like counties (<em>xian</em>) in that they may contain both types of townships (<em>xiang</em> and <em>zhen</em>), although the inner city ones are usually divided into streets (<em>jie</em>).  I think some contain all three, but it is very difficult to discover what the situation is for many cities (<em>shi</em>) and their urban disctricts, as sometimes the inner core urban districts are tightly demarcated around the built up area, while in other cases they are newly absorbed counties that contain a lot of rural towns and villages.</p>
