As the\n                        road is very bad, it is impossible to get there by car in summer. Even on\n                        horseback it is an extremely difficult task to reach it.</p>\n\n                     <p>The monastery was founded in 1748 by lHun grub dbang ldan. He was born in\n                        1703 in the sDe dge district of Khams. From childhood, he had innate\n                        knowledge and intelligence of remarkable lucidity. He devoted himself to the\n                        practice of meritorious deeds. He had love and compassion for all religious\n                        trainees. In the manifestation of right discernment that he displayed he was\n                        quite unlike any other child.</p>\n\n                     <p>When he reached the appropriate age, he received the most careful\n                        initiations and transmissions of Sutra and Tantra in the presence of the\n                        great abbot of sMan ri, gYung drung tshul khrims. Having done this, he made\n                        rapid progress in practising meditation. He circumambulated the holy\n                        mountains in Amdo and Central Tibet, regardless of the schools they belonged\n                        to. At the same time, he studied under many excellent masters of several\n                        monasteries. Since he respected them as his chief masters and received\n                        profound initiations, text-transmissions and religious teachings, he reached\n                        a state worthy of praise from everyone.</p>\n\n                     <p>Then he went to see lHo rTogs ldan dkar po, whose name was widely known. He\n                        prostrated himself, bowed his head and asked for blessed initiation and\n                        teachings. lHo rTogs ldan dkar po said,</p>\n\n                     <p>&ldquo;O You, the noble one, protector of fortunate religious beings!</p>\n\n                     <p>Having easily obtained selfhood without searching or exertion,</p>\n\n                     <p>Today we have met here naturally without motivation,</p>\n\n                     <p>You have had the fate [to see me] pulsing in your veins without fading, </p>\n\n                     <p>The fate of sentient beings lies on you; I shall tell you without\n                        concealment,</p>\n\n                     <p>You are the one called the Possessor of Self-created Power (lHun grup dbang\n                        ldan) of lHa thog,</p>\n\n                     <p>Act true to your name, and you will gain the ear of all the people.&rdquo;</p>\n\n                     <p>Following the instruction, lHun grup dbang ldan continued reciting prayers\n                        and devoted himself to making pilgrimages and sitting in hermitages,\n                        carrying with him the scriptures and a medical kit. Then he went northward,\n                        close to the yak hair tent of the chieftain of the Sog community, and asked\n                        for alms.</p>\n\n                     <p>There were three brothers in the chieftain&rsquo;s family: the elder, middle and\n                        younger, whose names were, respectively, Khro bo rgyal, Khro bo dar and Khro\n                        bo srung. At that time, Khro bo rgyal, the elder one, had been suffering\n                        from an illness for a year, during which all medical care and religious\n                        rituals had no effect at all. The three brothers invited the saint lHun grup\n                        dbang ldan into their tent, and the elder one, Khro bo rgyal, said,</p>\n\n                     <p>&ldquo;Happiness is welling up inside me at the very sight of you,</p>\n\n                     <p>Flowing through my body is energy that I have never felt before,</p>\n\n                     <p>I would like to remember what name you bear,</p>\n\n                     <p>I prostrate myself with reverence,</p>\n\n                     <p>I wonder what caused me to suffer from illness,</p>\n\n                     <p>I beg from you the best divinatory service to turn my illness away.&rdquo;</p>\n\n                     <p>lHun grup dbang ldan said in reply: &ldquo;I am the one called lHun grup dbang\n                        ldan, but I am not the one who tells whether the divination comes out good\n                        or bad. What I can do for you is to give you medical treatment.&rdquo; Then he\n                        made an examination of urine and faeces, and gave the most careful medical\n                        treatment to satisfy the elder brother&rsquo;s wishes.</p>\n\n                     <p>Forty-nine days later the patient finally got far better than their\n                        expectation, which, at the same time, raised faith and reverence in the\n                        brothers&rsquo; minds. Though they repeatedly asked him what kind of thing he\n                        wanted as a doctor&rsquo;s fee, he said &ldquo;I do not need any kind of doctor&rsquo;s fee,\n                        but I have a wish to build a monastery in accordance with the prophecy made\n                        previously by the superior saint. Therefore I shall request you to give me a\n                        small piece of land where a monastery could be built. The three brothers\n                        were so happy to hear his words that they said, &ldquo;We shall do as you tell\n                        us.&rdquo;</p>\n\n                     <p>Then the saint lHun grup dbang ldan, accompanied by the three brothers, went\n                        on to examine all the area under their jurisdiction within the Sog district,\n                        and encamped for a night at a place called Pha bong thang, where they saw\n                        many auspicious manifestations that night.</p>\n\n                     <p>Therefore, in 1797, a decision was made to establish a monastery on this\n                        distinctive land. The future monastery was given a good name, the Glorious\n                        Nor bu gling, and an elaborate purification ritual was performed.</p>\n\n                     <p>With regard to the surroundings of this square piece of land, they appear to\n                        be very good, described as follows: to the east is the protective mountain\n                        rGya stag khro bo, a white rocky mountain with the appearance of a haughty\n                        tiger that is thirsty, to the north is the protective Rus sbal ser po, a\n                        meadowy hill shining like a hero&rsquo;s helmet, to the west is the protective Bya\n                        dmar mtshal lu, a beautiful scarlet hill of slate mingled with verdigris, to\n                        the south is the protective gYu &rsquo;brug sngon po, a blue rocky mountain\n                        sticking high into the sky.</p>\n\n                     <p>All the lamas, leaders, patrons and priests were summoned, and worked\n                        without being lazy or negligent. Because of this, they managed to build the\n                        assembly hall of the monastery within the very year of the decision being\n                        taken. Not only that, by mutual agreement among the assembled monks of the\n                        Three Trainings, they increased the number of monks from four to six, then\n                        gradually from six to thirteen. In the early days, when there were only four\n                        monks, they were called &ldquo;the four young qualified ones&rdquo; (mTshan ldan khye&rsquo;u\n                        bzhi), when six, &ldquo;the six gShen who guide the beings&rdquo; (&rsquo;Dul ba gShen drug),\n                        and when increased to thirteen, they came to be known everywhere as &ldquo;the\n                        thirteen gShen&rdquo; (Ye gshen bcu gsum). From that time, the Bon doors of outer,\n                        inner and secret were opened and the great tradition of the teachings of\n                        chanting services and meditation came to be established, especially the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">rNam rgyal</span> and <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">gYung drung klong\n                           rgyas</span> which were performed according to the tradition established by\n                        the former adepts. This contributed to the increase of the monastery&rsquo;s\n                        activities and the spread of Eternal Bon.</p>\n\n                     <p>The lineage of the monastery is as follows:</p>\n\n                     <ol type=\"1\">\n                        <li> lHun grub dbang ldan, the founder of the monastery</li>\n\n                        <li> rGyal tshab lHun grub &rsquo;od zer</li>\n\n                        <li> bKra shis tshul khrims</li>\n\n                        <li> Tshul khrims &rsquo;od zer</li>\n\n                        <li> dPal ldan tshul khrims</li>\n\n                        <li> gYung drung rgyal ba</li>\n\n                        <li> mChog gyur grub dbang bsTan &rsquo;dzin rin chen nam mkha&rsquo; bde chen snying\n                           po</li>\n\n                        <li> bsTan &rsquo;dzin rgyal dbang</li>\n\n                        <li> bsTan &rsquo;dzin lhun grub </li>\n\n                        <li> Kun dga&rsquo; dbang ldan</li>\n\n                        <li> Kun mkhyen Sangs rgyas grags pa</li>\n\n                        <li> mNyam med Tshul khrims grags pa</li>\n\n                        <li> bsTan pa&rsquo;i nyi ma</li>\n                     </ol>\n\n                     \n\n                        "},{"title":"The size of the monastery and its religious objects","index":3,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n\n                        \n\n                           "},{"title":"’Du khang ka dgu ma","index":4,"parent_index":3,"body":"\n\n                           <p>At the centre of this assembly hall, built by bsTan &rsquo;dzin rin chen bde\n                              chen snying po, was a gilt-bronze statue of rNam par rgyal ba, about\n                              the height of an eight-year-old child.
