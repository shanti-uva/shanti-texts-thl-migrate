These\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcaves appear to be the original nucleus of settlement in the <span class=\"popular\">Pangtra</span><span class=\"scholar\">Spang bkra</span> valley. The caves are found from the base of the escarpment to within at least 60 m of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tits highly dissected flat summit.

Downstream of the cave complex,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe valley closes in around a gorge.
