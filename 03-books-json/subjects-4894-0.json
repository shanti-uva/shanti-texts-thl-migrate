It can function either as an autonomous verb (or “copula”), or as the auxiliary of another verb. This is comparable to the English “to be” or the French “être,” which are both copulas (e.g., “he <strong>is </strong>mad,” “il <strong>est</strong> fou”) and auxi­liaries (e.g., “he is working,” “il est arrivé”). Likewise, in the following Tibetan sentences <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">རེད་</span> is a copula in the first and an auxiliary (associated with the nominalizer <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">པ་</span>) in the second:</p> <ul> <li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ཁོང་སྨྱོན་པ་རེད།</span> “He is crazy.”</li> <li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ཁོང་ཕེབས་པ་རེད།</span> “He came.” (Literally: “He is come.”)</li> </ul> <p class=\"Paragraph\">As a copula, <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">རེད་ </span>expresses the nature or the essential quality of the subject. Note that <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">རེད་</span> “to be” is used to express people’s age, just as in English.</p> <p class=\"Paragraph\">The verb <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">རེད་ </span>is generally pronounced <em>ré </em>(with a more open vowel) in sentences that have an interrogative pronoun. However, the Tibetan spelling remains unaffected.</p> <p class=\"Paragraph\">Questions are constructed by using the final interrogative particle <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">པས་</span>:</p> <ul> <li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">རེད་པས།</span> “Is it?” </li> <li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">མ་རེད་པས།</span> “Isn’t it?” </li> </ul> <p class=\"Paragraph\">Like other auxiliaries, the verb<span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\"> རེད་</span> and its negation <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">མ་རེད་</span> are used to signify “yes” and “no.” They may be preceded by the polite marker <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ལགས་</span>.</p>","title":""}]}
