There are no less than the remains of 11 cubic tombs scattered across the upper half of the talus-covered ridgeline. This rocky spine (runs southeast-northwest) is aligned with the Bon sacred lake, <span class=\"popular\">Langa Tso</span><span class=\"scholar\">La lnga mtsho</span> and the Bon sacred mountain, <span class=\"popular\">Takri Trawo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Stag ri khra bo</span>/<span class=\"popular\">Nemona Nyi</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gnas mo sna gnyis</span>, a geographic situation which is not likely to be a coincidence. The geomantic dimensions of his configuration may have played an important role in the eschatological beliefs of the tomb builders. Above 5000 m, <span class=\"popular\">Rusbel Mukpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rus sbal smug po</span> also enjoys good views of the Great Central Himalaya from <span class=\"popular\">Lemi</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sle mi</span> to the Uttaranchal border. The existence of relatively well preserved specimens at this site proves that the cubic tomb typology, like that of the walled pillars and array of pillars appended to an edifice typologies, extended to extreme southwestern Tibet. The remote nature of <span class=\"popular\">Rusbel Mukpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rus sbal smug po</span> seems to have preserved the tombs from utter destruction or architectural modification by Buddhist zealots. <span class=\"popular\">Nyerma Gyam Möndo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gnyer ma gyam mon rdo</span> (D-60) and <span class=\"popular\">Dzari Rakpa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdza ri rag pa</span> (E-21) and <span class=\"popular\">Tremo Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Spre mo mkhar</span> (E-26), sites in the same region, do appear to have been as lucky. The structures of <span class=\"popular\">Rusbel Mukpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rus sbal smug po</span>are made of uncut grayish slabs and blocks 20 cm to 70 cm in length. Some of the tombs are aligned in the cardinal directions. </p>",
