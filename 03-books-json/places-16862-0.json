There are no less than the remains of 11 cubic tombs scattered across the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tupper half of the talus-covered ridgeline. This rocky spine (runs southeast-northwest) is aligned with the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBon sacred lake, <span class=\"popular\">Langa Tso</span><span class=\"scholar\">La lnga mtsho</span> and the Bon sacred mountain, <span class=\"popular\">Takri Trawo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Stag ri khra bo</span>/<span class=\"popular\">Nemona Nyi</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gnas mo sna gnyis</span>, a geographic situation which is not likely to be a coincidence. The geomantic dimensions of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthis configuration may have played an important role in the eschatological beliefs of the tomb builders.
