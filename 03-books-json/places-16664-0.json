The lower half of the stone has a splayed section (as do many dislodged specimens in Upper Tibet), which helped to anchor it firmly. This widened area of the standing stone\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tis exposed above ground level, suggesting that it was once set 60 cm to 75 cm more deeply into the substrate.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDespite the apparent replanting of the pillar, it is still firmly fixed in the ground. The current basal girth\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the pillar is 80 cm but originally it was probably about 1 m.

The style of the <span class=\"popular emph\">Ch&ouml;rten</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mchod rten</span> represents an earlier variant of this type of shrine.
