Towns and cities are often differentiated in terms of their administrative governance - towns might be \"unincorporated\" and have government services provided by the larger administrative unit such as a county (though they could also be \"incorporated\"); in contrast, cities might be \"incorporated\" as a legally defined government entity with the capacity to provide government services. But historically, there are may different definitions, such as does a specific settlement have a cathedral, a royal charter, or some other feature.  Cities generally have more developed infrastucture as well.</p>",
