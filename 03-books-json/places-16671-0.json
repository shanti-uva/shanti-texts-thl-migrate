The extant structural evidence indicates that walls of the enclosure were double-course and aligned in the cardinal directions. The extant wall segments are about 60 cm thick and constructed of a light-colored concretion and a black stone with white veins of variable length (up to 85 cm long). Around the enclosure there are many scattered stones that must have once been part of its construction. The surrounding terrain is largely free of stones. One meter east of the northeast corner of the enclosure there is an L-shaped wall fragment. It extends 5 m north and then turns west for 10 m paralleling the enclosure. </p>",
