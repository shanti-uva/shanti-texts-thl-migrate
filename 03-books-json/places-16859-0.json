This outcrop is part of a series of blackish formations known as <span class=\"popular\">Yatra Trik<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">G.ya\u2019 sbra khrigs<\/span>. The site enjoys open views in all directions. The outcrop is covered in dark blue slates some of which have weathered to a reddish color. These slates were used to construct six sub-rectangular above ground tombs. These structures are of a more rudimentary construction than the typical mountaintop cubic tomb. Through subsidence and the ravages of time, the structures of <span class=\"popular\">Yatra Trik<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">G.ya\u2019 sbra khrigs<\/span> now have a rounded appearance. Each specimen contains a large central cavity (reliquary) encased in the outer walls. These walls are made from slabs 20 cm to 80 cm in length and 2 cm to 10 cm in thickness. There are no signs that the cavities were ever lined with a finer inner layer of masonry. The upper portions of the outer walls of each structure taper inwards. This inward positioning of the slabs must have continued all the way up to the original height of the structures. Given the local geology, it is likely that the tops of the walls were capped with long slates. The structures must have been approximately 50 percent higher than the tallest extant specimens (1.2 m), in order to be spanned by the slates available at the site. The bases of the structures are often inset into the mantle of slates covering the summit. This must have given the roughly built structures more stability. <\/p><p>There are also wall remnants along the west rim of the formation and along the north flank of the site, dividing he upper and lower summits of the formation. These wall traces (none of which are free standing) were built in a similar fashion to the tombs, and are an integral part of the funerary complex. They may have had ritual functions. <span class=\"popular\">Yatra Trik<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">G.ya\u2019 sbra khrigs<\/span> is one of the most northerly archaeological sites surveyed to date.
