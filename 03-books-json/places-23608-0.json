This is said to have taken place in the Earth-Dragon Year of the\n                        4th Rab byung (1268). He eventually founded sKyang tshang Monastery. His\n                        successors in the family were Rin chen blo gros, bDud &rsquo;dul dbang grags,\n                        gYung drung bstan rgyal, dKon mchog yon tan, rNam rgyal thogs med. After the\n                        latter&rsquo;s death the line of the sKyang tshang family was interrupted. </p>\n\n                     <p>dBra tsha A lha ye shes was selected to be the head of the monastery, but\n                        during his time, in the Fire-Dog Year of the 10th Rab byung (1586), the\n                        monastery was destroyed by an earthquake. Several decades later, rTogs ldan\n                        gYung drung bstan &rsquo;dzin (b.1654), a brother of Tshe rgyal, the sKyang tshang\n                        chief, returned from sMan ri Monastery (No.1) and asked Tshe rgyal to give\n                        him a site called sKyang klu gdong where he founded a small monastery. Later\n                        A mkhar, another sKyang tshang chief, asked Bya tshang rTogs ldan bsTan\n                        &rsquo;dzin rgyal mtshan to be the head of the monastery, and both chief and the\n                        master agreed to move the monastery to a new site. The new monastery was\n                        called gSer khang rin chen, but it was burned down in a fight. </p>\n\n                     <p>rTogs ldan Phun tshogs &rsquo;od zer founded a new monastery called Khri skyong la\n                        kha&rsquo;i dgon Kun khyab bde chen gling for sKyang tshang village. Then sKyang\n                        sprul Nam mkha&rsquo; rgyal mtshan was invited to be the head of the monastery in\n                        the Earth-Rat Year of the 14th Rab byung (1828). The next head in the\n                        succession was Rin chen Tshul khrims. Since there was no Sources of water in\n                        the vicinity of the monastery, lHun grub rgyal mtshan moved it to rNyi &rsquo;bur\n                        valley where it became known as rNyi &rsquo;bur Monastery.
