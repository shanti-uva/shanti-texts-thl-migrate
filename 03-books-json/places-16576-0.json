Only faint structural remains exist of what is locally believed to have been a Buddhist monastery (it may have been inherited from he Bonpo). Even most of the foundation walls have been eradicated. The structural vestiges are spread over an area of approximately 24 m x 11 m around the mouth of the cave. It appears that this cave was completely enclosed by walls. Only a small segment of the south wall has survived. This random-rubble structure is about 2 m tall and 70 cm in thickness. There are possibly structural extensions to the west, the direction of a now disused corral.
