The hilltop and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\truins are made from a light-colored stone with prominent black grains, causing the site to be either black or\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnearly white, depending on light conditions. True to its name, a flock of crows inhabits the locale. There were\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthree buildings on the summit that are now reduced to their foundations. These foundations are set on prominent\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trevetments, 75 cm to 1.5 m in height. The foundations and revetments were constructed of mud-mortared\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcoursed-rubble.
