The wholesale destruction of the <span class=\"popular\">J iu</span><span class=\"scholar\">Byi’u</span> funerary monuments, a function of greed and ignorance, is a significant cultural loss. Wrought by the Tibetans themselves, this comes on top of the highly destructive Chinese Cultural Revolution.
