Most of the time, the inferential mode may be translated into English by adding “Look!” or “Why!” to the beginning of a statement in the past tense. In the example given above, it’s <em>upon discovering<\/em> a construction site in a sector of Lhasa that the speaker says “Why, they’ve built a lot of new houses!” In certain contexts, the form <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">བཞག་<\/span> may have another, purely resultative connotation: the speaker may use it to emphasize the enduring presence of a past action, even if he or she has been able to see not just these traces but the entirety of the action that is being described.<\/p> <ul> <li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">བློ་བཟང་ལགས་འདིར་བཞུགས་བཞག <\/span>“Lopzang is here.” (Literally: “has stayed here”)<\/li> <\/ul> <p class=\"Paragraph\">In this statement, the speaker has just discovered Lopzang’s presence either by seeing him directly or from various clues (his hat, for example). Alternatively, he might have been aware of his presence for some time but is emphasizing the fact that he is <em>still <\/em>around.<\/p>","title":""}]}
