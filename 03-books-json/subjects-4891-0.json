Most of the time, the inferential mode may be translated into English by adding \u201cLook!\u201d or \u201cWhy!\u201d to the beginning of a statement in the past tense. In the example given above, it\u2019s <em>upon discovering<\/em> a construction site in a sector of Lhasa that the speaker says \u201cWhy, they\u2019ve built a lot of new houses!\u201d In certain contexts, the form <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">\u0f56\u0f5e\u0f42\u0f0b<\/span> may have another, purely resultative connotation: the speaker may use it to emphasize the enduring presence of a past action, even if he or she has been able to see not just these traces but the entirety of the action that is being described.<\/p><ul> <li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">\u0f56\u0fb3\u0f7c\u0f0b\u0f56\u0f5f\u0f44\u0f0b\u0f63\u0f42\u0f66\u0f0b\u0f60\u0f51\u0f72\u0f62\u0f0b\u0f56\u0f5e\u0f74\u0f42\u0f66\u0f0b\u0f56\u0f5e\u0f42 <\/span>\u201cLopzang is here.\u201d (Literally: \u201chas stayed here\u201d)<\/li> <\/ul><p class=\"Paragraph\">In this statement, the speaker has just discovered Lopzang\u2019s presence either by seeing him directly or from various clues (his hat, for example).
