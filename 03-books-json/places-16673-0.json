As the monument is found in a dip in the plain, the views to the east and west are somewhat circumscribed. On the other hand, the views north and south are quite open. The sandy terrain gently declines owards the east. Unhewn pieces of reddish brown sandstone were used to build the monument. <\/p>"},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":"<p>In this region (<span class=\"popular\">Naktsang<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Nag tshang<\/span>), sites such as <span class=\"popular\">Zhalung Doring<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Zha lung rdo ring<\/span> are closely associated with the ancient <span class=\"popular\">M\u00f6n<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon<\/span>.<\/p>"},{"title":"Site elements","index":6,"parent_index":2},{"title":"Enclosure","index":7,"parent_index":6,"body":"<p>The enclosure is aligned in the cardinal directions, and measures 5 m (north-south) x 11.5 m (east-west). The west wall of the enclosure is largely intact, the east partly intact, and small parts of the north and south walls have survived as well. The variable-length (15 cm to 70 cm long) blocks and slabs of the double-course walls (50 cm to 60 cm thick) are level with the ground or elevated a maximum of 15 cm above it. The many stones scattered around the enclosure were probably once part of its construction (the surrounding terrain is largely free from such stones). <\/p>"},{"title":"Pillar","index":8,"parent_index":6,"body":"<p>The single tabular pillar (75 cm [height] x 1.1 m [basal girth]) is fairly well centered between the north and south walls of the enclosure.
