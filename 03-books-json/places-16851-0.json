The structure (2.8 m x 2 m x 1.3 m) is quite closely aligned in the cardinal directions. On the top of the more intact east side of the tomb there are stone chips. These chips may have been part of the original capping structure overlying the central depository. The partially intact, rectangular chamber is 60 cm wide. Variable sized slabs (up to 70 cm long) went into the construction of FS26. Some tens of meters to the south are FS15 and FS16. <\/p> <p>Funerary structure FS27, another cubic tomb, is situated lower, in a notch in the ridge-top (04.191&#900; \/ 25.295&#900; \/ 4500 m).

The central depository measures 50 cm (north-south) x 90 cm (east-west) and has a maximum depth of 40 cm (but it is partially filled with rubble). On the west side of the central depository, several stones form overlapping vertical courses. <\/p> "},{"title":"Large enclosure","index":12,"parent_index":6,"body":null}]}
