At the lower end of <span class=\"popular\">Gyamchung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gyam chung</span> there is a corral of the local seasonal <span class=\"popular emph\">drok pa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">’brog pa</span> encampment. <span class=\"popular\">Gyamchung Möndur</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gyam chung mon dur</span> consists of four or five cubic tombs and more than 20 walls, forming terraces along steep slopes and the edges of cliffs. The terraced structures have forward walls with significant elevations, while their rear walls are usually flush with the uphill slope. Most of these structures have a width of 1 m or less. The function of the terraced constructions is enigmatic. They appear to have had a funerary ritual function rather than a defensive role as ramparts, but this remains to be proven. In any case, ramparts have not been found with cubic tombs at any other site in western Tibet. All the cubic tombs and terraced constructions of <span class=\"popular\">Gyamchung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gyam chung</span> have eastern and southern exposures. They were built with random-rubble, dry-mortar walls. Variable-length slabs (20 cm to 90 cm) and blocky stones went into their construction. A grayish (metamorphic?) rock with a well-developed reddish brown varnish was used to build the structures of the site. </p>

These chips may have been part of the original capping structure overlying the central depository. The partially intact, rectangular chamber is 60 cm wide. Variable sized slabs (up to 70 cm long) went into the construction of FS26. Some tens of meters to the south are FS15 and FS16. </p>

Measuring 6 m (lateral walls) x 16 m (walls parallel to the axis of the slope), it could not be determined whether this was a residential or ceremonial ruin. It is built on a rocky slope with an approximate 10° gradient. Much of the structure is set well below ground level. While the uphill wall is relatively well preserved (consists of several vertical courses of masonry), the other walls have lost their coherence. Stones primarily 25 cm to 50 cm in length went into the construction of this structure. </p>
