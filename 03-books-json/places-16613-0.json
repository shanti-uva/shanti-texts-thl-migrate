This is the site of extremely important Bon pictographs (J-16). The south-facing cave consists of one large chamber, 48 m long and 4.5 m to 9 m in width. The mouth of the cave is roughly 10 m in height and above the entrance there is a natural skylight.

The large size of the cave and its substantial anthropogenic modification point to the existence of a significant archaic cultural installation.

The 50-cm to 70-cm thick cave fa\u00e7ade that barricaded the mouth of the grotto is partially intact along its east and west extremities. The fa\u00e7ade was skillfully built with a random-rubble texture, and contains stones that average 20 cm to 30 cm in length (full range: 15 cm to 50 cm long). Copious amounts of mud-mortar were applied to the wall joints. The east segment of the fa\u00e7ade is 5.5 m in length and up to 5 m in height. The west fragment of the fa\u00e7ade is 7.5 m in length and a maximum of 4 m in height.
