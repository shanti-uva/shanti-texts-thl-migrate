It approximately measures 9.2 m\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(northeast-southwest) x 6.1 m (southeast-northwest). This orientation may have been adopted due to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\texigencies of the local topography. The valley in which it is found is aligned in the southeast (upstream) and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnorthwest (downstream) directions. The enclosure walls are all highly disintegrated. However, parts of all but\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe southwest wall are extant. The southwest wall must have been parallel to the row of pillars and in close\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tproximity, as suggested by the dispersion of unfixed stones. The perimeter walls contain both flush blocks and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tupright slabs, up to 60 cm in length. These stones are even with the ground surface or project above it as much\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tas 20 cm. The specific design traits and thickness of the perimeter walls is no longer evident. Two prominent\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstones set perpendicular to the course of the northeast wall form the sides of an opening 1.1 m in width. These\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttwo upright &lsquo;portal&rsquo; slabs are 70 cm in length (with a 20 cm projection above the ground surface) and 60 cm in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlength (with a 25 cm projection above the surface). The portal is situated 2 m from the southeast corner and 3 m\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom the northwest corner of the enclosure. The northeast wall course seems to span the portal thus it is not\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcompletely open. Many stones are scattered around the enclosure.
