This poorly preserved rectangular enclosure still possesses small bits of integral walls. On its west side, the forward wall is elevated 1 m above the slope. The north side of the perimeter is elevated about 50 cm above the slope, while the east and south sides are mostly flush with the surface. The partly intact double-course perimeter walls contain variable-length (up to 70 cm long) stones. The area inside the enclosure is free of interior structural elements. On the north side of the perimeter there is a coherent wall section composed of hree or four vertical courses of stones. This evidence indicates that FS1 had a superstructure of significant height. A small shepherd’s shelter was built on the southeast corner of the perimeter. Other stones are piled near the southwest corner of the structure. These structures must have been built with stones extracted from the enclosure.<\/p> <p>There is an area of double-course cobble wall fragments (2.5 m in length) situated 3.5 m south of the enclosure. As only around 30 cobbles are still fixed in the ground, the design and configuration of these walls could not be determined. <\/p> "},{"title":"Affiliated sites","index":8,"parent_index":2,"body":" "},{"title":"sPo ba","index":9,"parent_index":8,"body":" <p>In the main <span class=\"popular\">Reco<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Re co<\/span> valley at a location called <span class=\"popular\">Powa<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Spo ba<\/span> (Stud Yak) there is a single funerary enclosure (33° 23.276΄ N. lat. \/ 79° 14.768΄ \/ 4380 m).
