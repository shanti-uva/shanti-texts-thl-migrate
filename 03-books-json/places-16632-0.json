Ensconced in the limestone cliffs on either side of the <span class=\"popular\">Tara Marding<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Rta ra dmar lding<\/span> defile there are the remains of masonry façades, revetments and other types of walls belonging to the archaic cultural horizon. All walls are configured in a random-rubble, dry-fitted texture. These bluish limestone walls were, for the most part, heavily built (50 cm to 80 cm thick with stones up to 1 m in length). Such walled grottos are never associated with Buddhist emblems, at least as regards their primary occupation. Various swastikas painted in red ochre at <span class=\"popular\">Tara Marding<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Rta ra dmar lding<\/span> mark the archaic cultural presence at the site, in a period before the<span class=\"popular\">zimpuk<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Gzims phug<\/span> locale devolved to the <span class=\"popular emph\">nyingmapa<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rnying ma pa<\/span>.

From hat time until the actual monastery was founded in 1095 CE (a 327 year gap), it is thought that local <span class=\"popular emph\">drok pa<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">’brog pa<\/span> carried out Buddhist rites in the various caves.

This archaeological evidence establishes that there was indeed an archaic cultural (early Bon) presence at <span class=\"popular\">zimpuk<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Gzims phug<\/span>. No mention of this fact is made in rig ‘dzin chos ‘phel’s history. As is customary in Buddhist literature, this ‘dark period’ in Tibetan cultural history is simply skipped over. The epigraphy and rock art indicates that those practicing non-Buddhist religious raditions were active at the site long after <span class=\"popular\">Guru Rinpoché<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ru rin po che<\/span>’s supposed visitation. In fact, encounters between the two contending religious groups are chronicled in the not always harmonious juxtaposition of their mantras and symbols.

The reference to the founding of <span class=\"popular\">Pel Zimpuk<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Dpal gzims phug<\/span> monastery in 1095 CE probably heralds he definitive takeover of the site by the Buddhists.

The lofty west rock shelter (24 m wide, 24 m deep) has a defensible position, a common preoccupation with builders in ancient Upper Tibet. The blue limestone structures have turned red through geochemical action. The remains of a façade 17 m in length enclose the mouth of the overhang. On the southwest end much of this massively constructed front wall (80 cm thick) has disappeared. Other portions of it, however, reach 4 m in height on the exterior face and 1 m on the interior. Given its heavy construction and low interior height, this wall is likely to have been much taller originally. It encloses a fairly level area hat extends for 14 m inside the rock shelter. This zone terminates at the faint remains of an inner wall. Beyond this point, the floor is very rocky and steeply sloping to the rear of the cave. In the rear of the cave, three bold red ochre counterclockwise swastikas were painted beyond arm’s length. In close proximity here are also fainter counterclockwise swastikas. Reinforcing its bastion status there are the remains of a small curtain-wall on the floor of the gorge below the west rock shelter. Wall fragments of a residential structure also cling to the north face of the defile. <\/p> "},{"title":"South rock shelter","index":10,"parent_index":8,"body":" <p>The south rock shelter is suspended above the floor of the gorge, investing it with a protective position. It is situated about 20 m lower in elevation than the west rock shelter. The south rock shelter has a high ceiling just like its counterpart. Only small remains of its 22-m long retaining wall have survived. On the east end a segment of this wall is 9 m in length; it reaches 2 m high on the exterior side while its interior is flush with the floor of the shelter. A well-built wall fragment 2 m long was built inside the south rock shelter at a distance of 5 m from the front wall. This internal feature probably had something to do with the residential function of the cave. Along the east flank of the south rock shelter there are wall fragments set deep inside a fissure in the cliff. <\/p> "},{"title":"Mouth of the defile structures","index":11,"parent_index":8,"body":" <p>Above the mouth of the defile on its north side there are the remains of a structure (4 m x 2.7 m) built between the cliff face and an outcrop. Walls of this small shelter reach 3 m in height and exhibit the masonry exture and degradation of the archaic cultural horizon. On the edge of the ledge running northeast from this structure there are the vestiges of footings (probably supported an outer defensive wall) that extend for 23 m. The overarching cliff partially shelters the ledge upon which these structures were built (much of this ledge is around 6 m wide). In the middle portion of the ledge, a small Buddhist retreat house was built against the cliff. The stonework is largely intact, mud mortared and covered in lime plaster. Just north of the ledge there is a fissure in the cliff with the remains of a wall (3 m long) enclosing much of it. <\/p> "},{"title":"North cliff structures, inscriptions and pictographs","index":12,"parent_index":8,"body":" <p>The ledge at the mouth of the defile is interconnected to another ledge to the north that directly overlooks <span class=\"popular\">Zimpuk Tso<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Gzims phug mtsho<\/span>. Rising about 50 m above the lake basin, this ledge is 42 m long and 3 m to 7 m wide. Running along the rim of this ledge there are wall footings, suggesting that it once supported more extensive structures. It is dominated by an old building that evidently had religious functions (18 m in length), whose walls are largely intact (they are 2 m o 2.5 m in height). This structure contains a single line of five rooms. Doors between the rooms have stone lintels, as does one of the two small windows in the exterior wall. Although the design (mud-mortared, high elevation walls, etc.), layout and relatively good condition of the structure indicate that it was established in a later period than the more primitive rock shelters, its cultural identity is not clear. This kind of information was not preserved in the oral tradition of <span class=\"popular\">Pel Zimpuk<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Dpal gzims phug<\/span>. <\/p> <p>Above the main entrance to the five-roomed edifice, an archaic style <span class=\"popular emph\">Chörten<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mchod rten<\/span> (with a small <span class=\"popular emph\">bhumpa<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">bum pa<\/span>, long banner, etc.) was painted on the cliff face in red ochre and white lime (?).<a href=\"#n104\" name=\"nb104\" class=\"note\">104<\/a> Perhaps this is a sign that the structure was built and occupied by the Bonpo. Also, within the confines of this building there is a counterclockwise swastika in white, a design resembling he conjoined sun and moon (<span class=\"popular emph\">nyida<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">nyi zla<\/span>) and the word <span class=\"popular emph\">gönpa<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rgon pa<\/span> written in red ochre. I take this inscription to be an archaic spelling for monastery (<span class=\"popular emph\">gönpa<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">dgon pa<\/span>), identifying he structure as religious in nature. In close proximity to the five-roomed edifice there is a small wall with old plaques inscribed with the <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma ṇi<\/span> mantra, a clear indication of the Buddhist occupation of<span class=\"popular\">Tara Marding<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Rta ra dmar lding<\/span>.<\/p> <p>South of the five-roomed edifice there is pictographic panel (1.1 m x 70 cm) that consists of a vertical row of three swastikas, the top two of which point in a clockwise direction, the bottom one in a counterclockwise direction. These swastikas are flanked by about 70 small blotches on each side. This white pigment composition appears to have been charged with symbolic meaning, the precise nature of which is open to debate. Perhaps each dot represents a member of the local community, made in a pre-12th century CE period when a Bon-Buddhist syncretism possibly prevailed. The integration of swastikas oriented in both directions may hint at such an accommodation. In any event, the significant level of wear and signs of organic infiltrations indicate that this panel was painted centuries ago. <\/p> <p>On the cliff face immediately north of the five-roomed edifice there are the remnants of <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma ṇi<\/span> mantras written on a white background. On another panel with a white background, the <span class=\"popular\">Riksum Gönpo<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Rigs gsum mgon po<\/span> mantras were written. North of these panels there is a large red ochre <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma ṇi<\/span> mantra adeptly written on a white background. With its reverse letter <span class=\"popular emph\">i<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">i<\/span> and Bon-style <span class=\"popular emph\">om<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">oṃ<\/span>,<a href=\"#n105\" name=\"nb105\" class=\"note\">105<\/a> this mantra can probably be dated to the pre-12th century CE cultural milieu. Above this unusual <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma ṇi<\/span> mantra there is a faded red ochre counterclockwise swastika. In close proximity the <span class=\"emph\">vajra<\/span> mantra, <span class=\"popular emph\">lama<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">bla ma<\/span> and <span class=\"popular emph\">gashwa rimum<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ga shwa ri mum<\/span> (something to do with a white-headed mountain deer?) were inscribed in red ochre. Below the unusual <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma ṇi<\/span> mantra there are the traces of a well-executed counterclockwise swastika (50 cm high) drawn in an off-white pigment. The same pigment was used to obscure nearly all of it. This appears to be graphic evidence of a Bon-Buddhist rivalry symbolically played out on the rock faces of <span class=\"popular\">zimpuk<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Gzims phug<\/span>. The propinquity of Bon and Buddhist symbols and inscriptions at the site seems to indicate a not always easy co-habitation involving the practitioners of archaic religious traditions and Buddhism. This convergence must have occurred during the ime in which the religious orientation of this important economic site was being decided once and for all. In he proximity of the inscriptions there are the remains of an archaic style <span class=\"popular emph\">Chörten<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mchod rten<\/span> or other type of shrine red ochre pictograph. Its total height is 48 cm but only the top 30 cm are clearly visible. The clear portion consists of three graduated iers surmounted by a short shaft and a crowning spherical structure. The bottom portion of the pictograph appears to consist of a large square base. <\/p> "},{"title":"Rock shelter south of the defile","index":13,"parent_index":7,"body":" <p>There are ancient wall remains south of the <span class=\"popular\">Tamar Ding<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Rta dmar lding<\/span> defile (31° 24.07΄ N. lat. \/ 88° 42.91΄ E. long. \/ 4680 m).

The four well-known types of <span class=\"popular emph\">Chörten<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mchod rten<\/span> in India have specifically attributed designs: 1) like a bubble, 2) head ornament, 3) bell, and 4) pile of grain. gde ’dun chos ‘phel also observes that in India <span class=\"popular emph\">Torma<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">gtor ma<\/span> (sacrifical cake) offerings of grain, bread, etc. were made, not the high-peaked <span class=\"popular emph\">Torma<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">gtor ma<\/span> designs of various ancient Tibetan rituals. The Tibetan ancestors preferred hats and gtor ma in the shapes of mountains. They liked various <span class=\"popular emph\">lhaten<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">lha rten<\/span> (tabernacles) in the shape of very sharp mountain peaks.
