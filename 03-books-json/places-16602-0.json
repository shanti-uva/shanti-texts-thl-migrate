The location commands wide views of the <span class=\"popular\">Druk Tsangpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">&rsquo;Brug gtsang po</span> basin in all but the eastern direction. The site\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconsists of six buildings that were established on a turf-covered southern aspect ridgeback. These structures are\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tset 5 m to 7 m vertically apart in a more or less single line on the approximately 15&deg; slope. Although the site is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcalled a fortress (<span class=\"popular emph\">dzong</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rdzong</span>), the rather exposed spur it was built on is not\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tparticularly defensible. The high ground of an adjoining summit outflanks the site. Furthermore, there is an\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tabsence of the defensive bulwarks usually associated with Upper Tibetan strongholds. <span class=\"popular\">Drakgam Dzong</span><span class=\"scholar\">Brag sgam rdzong</span> is more likely to have been an\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\telite residence with both religious and social functions.

Other walls of the complex are of the random-rubble clay- or mud-mortar type. These walls (60 to 70\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcm thick) contain variable-length stones (primarily a blue-gray metamorphic rock?), the exterior faces of which\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twere hewn flat. Except for RS1, all edifices were built with all-stone corbelled roof assemblies. This is the most\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\teasterly site in Upper Tibet to still have in situ evidence of such\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconstructions. Unlike all-stone structures at some other sites, those at <span class=\"popular\">Drakgam Dzong</span><span class=\"scholar\">Brag sgam rdzong</span> are not well aligned in the cardinal directions.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"popular\">Drakgam Dzong</span><span class=\"scholar\">Brag sgam rdzong</span> apparently drew its\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\teconomic well-being from the extensive pasturage that lies below the site (regional and inter-regional trade\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnotwithstanding). To the south and east of the ridge there are a series of springs that must have provided water\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfor the inhabitants&rsquo; use.

It boasts of stone and rammed-earth walls 4 m to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t5 m in height. Although its original height is not known, RS1 appears to have been two stories tall. Its three\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\teastern aspect wall alignments each measure 5.8 m, 2.4 m and 3 m. Its other walls measure: 7 m (south), 9.6 m\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(north) and 9.8 m (west). The lower portions of the walls (up to 1.3 m high) are composed of random-work with\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvariable-sized stones (primarily 20 cm to 50 cm long). These stone walls are surmounted by highly eroded\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trammed-earth upper walls (now 50 cm to 60 cm thick). The rammed-earth contains a prominent gravel matrix and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstone slabs are embedded in a few places in these walls. The regularly spaced orifices used to hold the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tshuttering pins during the construction process are visible all along the earthen walls. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>On its exterior north and west faces, RS1 is reinforced by stone buttresses up to 2 m in height.

There are three main partition wall fragments still in situ in RS1, but originally it may have been\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsubdivided into more rooms. Near the west corner of the interior, two corbels protrude around 20 cm from the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\touter wall. These corbels are suspended 60 cm above the current floor level (originally, the floor appears to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thave been much lower). In close proximity to these in situ corbels are the remains of a basement (3 m wide,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1.5 m deep). The roof of this inferior space is composed of corbels and bridging stones, which are now\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tobscured by much earth and stone debris. There are the remains of a partition wall in the basement. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>RS1 is enclosed by substantial retaining walls in all directions.
