He is said to have had two priests: <span class=\"popular\">Abong</span><span class=\"scholar\">A bong</span>, the tiger lama, and <span class=\"popular\">Mibong</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mi bong</span>, the lama with the magic lasso. The river of <span class=\"popular\">Takrong</span><span class=\"scholar\">Stag rong</span> passes under an area of geothermal activity.

The geomantic heart of the site is a high volume hot spring called <span class=\"popular\">Sinpo Nyingchu</span><span class=\"scholar\">Srin po snying chu</span>.

Other light and dark pinnacles called <span class=\"popular\">Lékarnak</span><span class=\"scholar\">Las dkar nag</span> (White and Black Destiny) represent heaven and hell.
