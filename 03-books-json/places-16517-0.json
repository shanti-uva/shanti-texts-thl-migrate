The very narrow nature of the summit helped to limit the dimensions of the individual structures. The tallest revetment built against the formation is 2 m; these walls unmistakably had a defense function. They must have been the bases of ramparts, which surrounded the summit in an intricate pattern of short walls interspersed between the natural crags. The walls of the old buildings are around 60 cm thick and are made with variable sized stones, 20 cm to 60 cm in length. Mostly granite was used in construction but gray stone and occasional chunks of milky quartz were also exploited. On the south side of the summit there is a revetment fragment 1 m thick. One of the most intact and largest buildings (3 m x 3.3 m) is found near the north side of the summit. Its walls reach 2.5 m in height and, like other structures at the site, much of the mud-mortar in the walls has washed away. On the less steep and rocky east or inner side of the formation, buildings may have extended in a band 20 m in height from the edge of he summit to the base of the outcrop. This east flank dispersion is 30 m in width and is thickly blanketed in rubble. <\/p> "},{"title":"Ancient village","index":8,"parent_index":6,"body":null},{"title":"Northeast sector","index":9,"parent_index":8,"body":" <p>The northeast sector is located at the base of the inner side\/east of the fortress outcrop. It consists of a contiguous zone of at least two dozen small but heavily built foundations, covering an area of 53 m (east-west) x 46 m (north-south). On the north end of the northeast sector there are old enclosures resembling corrals. Wall segments commonly attain 1 m in height. The foundations often integrate naturally occurring boulders, some of which are more than 1 m in length. The robustly constructed walls tend to be built of larger stones (40 cm to 70 cm), and are 70 cm to 90 cm thick. Outside of the northwest sector, there are several other foundations on the edge of the outcrop, extending to its southeast side. <\/p> "},{"title":"Southeast sector","index":10,"parent_index":8,"body":null},{"title":"South sector","index":11,"parent_index":8,"body":" <p>On the south side of the formation, at lower elevation, there are three separate buildings or a single building divided into three wings, covering an area of 18 m x 6 m. This structure was built at three different levels in line with the slope gradient. In close proximity there are at least three smaller foundations. Lower down there is a carcass (6 m x 7 m), its walls set deeply into the rear slope. Adjacent to it are several smaller building footprints. Two interconnected foundations (11 m x 15 m), as well as the footings of a single building (7.8 m x 6 m), are found at the lower end of the south sector. <\/p>  "}]}
