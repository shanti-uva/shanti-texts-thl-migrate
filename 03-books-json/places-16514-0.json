The parent hill is on the right bank of the <span class=\"popular\">Maja Tsangpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rma bya gtsang po</span> (Karnali river).

On the 15-m wide summit there is a highly eroded V-shaped rammed-earth wall, 15 m in length, a maximum of 1 m thick and approximately 6 m high. The mouth of the ‘V’ is 5 m wide. There are, more or less, 12 horizontal rows of orifices in this wall, in which pins used to hold the shuttering in place during construction were inserted. Capping many of these orifices is a stone in the wall and in some places adobe blocks. The walls of the ruined <span class=\"popular\">sakya</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sa skya</span> monastery are constructed in a similar fashion, while those of <span class=\"popular\">Shenpel Ling</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bshad ’phel gling</span> are much less weathered, contain far fewer orifices and only average 40 cm to 60 cm in thickness. In addition to the landmark wall segment, there is cobble building rubble on the summit. This rubble is scattered west and south of the summit. Faint traces of another wall are found on the steep south flank of the summit. </p>",
