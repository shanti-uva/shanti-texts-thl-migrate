It was moved to another site but because of some sort of threat to the monks’ lives, the monastery was moved back to its original site. Later, another disaster occured: three of the monks held up three horses belonging to the chief of Cone for reasons that remain unexplained. The chief of Cone retaliated by burning down the monastery. There is little information concerning the monastery’s history besides the fact that it was connected to A skyid sKyang tshang Monastery (No.194) in mDzod dge, and for this reason a monk of sKyang tshang called Dri med ’od zer undertook the reconstruction of the monastery in 1993. </p>",
