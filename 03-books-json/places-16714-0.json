Unfortunately, the integrity of the site was recently compromised when stones were extracted in order to line the edge of the neighboring road. Near the northwest end of the site many stones are now missing, making an analysis of the morphological characteristics of <span class=\"popular\">Doring<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo ring<\/span> difficult. It is possible that there were more than two rows of upright stones at the northwest end of the site. The two extant rows consist of uncut light-colored granite and limestone slabs and blocks (20 cm to 90 cm long) embedded in the ground edgewise. These stones are flush with the ground surface or are elevated above it to a maximum height of 25 cm. The only exceptions are a few more prominently elevated stones in the middle portion of he east wall. These taller stones are dominated by a firmly planted pillar-like granite boulder (1 m [height] x 1.4 m [basal girth]). On the southeast end of <span class=\"popular\">Doring<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo ring<\/span> there are traces of a single line of upright stones bisecting the two main rows of stones.<\/p>  "}]}
