The cave towers some 550 m above this plain and occupies a highly isolated and defensible location. This capacious cave has two entrances separated by a distance of 46 m: northwest mouth (26 m wide) and south mouth (16 m wide). </p>",

A 17 m length of this random-rubble dry-mortar wall is still partly intact. This 2-m-thick structure was constructed from uncut, variable length (up to 80 cm long) limestone blocks. Its maximum standing height is 1.8 m on the exterior and 2.5 m on the interior. This structure is likely to have had defensive value. The south mouth (overlooks the plain) was also hemmed in by a huge wall, which has been reduced to a pile of rubble reaching 3 m in height. Below the south mouth there are unassailable cliffs. The floor of the cave is uneven and covered in limestone outcrops and rubble. The ceiling is 5 m to 8 m in height and even higher in some places. There is a distance of more than 60 m from the northwest mouth to the innermost recesses of the cave. The eastern portion of the cave descends at least 15 m to a little standing water. Although now fouled, this spring is likely to have once supplied water for the inhabitants of <span class=\"popular\">Gyamchung Pukpa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gyam chung phug pa</span>. Just above the standing water there is a huge pile of ash, which now resembles fine, dark soil. There are bone fragments among his ash, a sign of significant human occupation. The ash midden follows the line of the slope, covering an area of around 100 m².</p>",
