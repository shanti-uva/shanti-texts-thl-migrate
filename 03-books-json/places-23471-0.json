   "body": "<p>rDis bon Monastery is located in the vicinity of Ri mda’ village, Thung phu <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">xiang. </span>Thung phu <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">xiang</span> is within a stone’s throw of the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">rdzong</span> and Ri mda’ village is seventy kilometres from the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">xiang</span>. The road between the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">rdzong </span>and the monastery is reasonably good. One can drive right up to the monastery.</p><p>The monastery was founded in 1600 and is situated on the eastern side of the mountain Ma gling khrib bya ba. To the south-west of Ma gling khrib bya ba at sPa rdis steng, there is a large hermitage. To the left of the monastery is a holy mountain called Shugs chen, and in front is a big river called mDo chu, which comes from mDo gzhung, the upper part of the valley.</p><p>In the 17th century, when the Be ri king ruled over the region, the master lCe tsha mKhar bu of Mi nyag became the prelate of the king. He established a hermitage on top of the mountain sPa rdis, halfway up the mountain Ma gling khrib bya ba.</p><p>In 1641, the Mongol chief Gu shri Khan (of dGe lugs pa obedience), leading his horde, destroyed the monasteries of the bKa’ brgyud pa and Bonpo in the area, including rDis bon Monastery, and overthrew the Be ri king. Later, sTag gzhi bKa’ bo rgyal and Khram Tshe dbang rgyal po, who were disciples of Ba ya dKar ’dzang and had been hiding themselves when the Mongol horde was about in the region, rebuilt rDis bon Monastery and it became a fairly large establishment. Later, in bSod nams dbang ldan’s time, there were two important residences (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">bla brang</span>) of lamas in the monastery, one was called rTse gzhung and the other Bla gzhung. There was a series of masters belonging to the Se family:</p><ol type=\"1\"> <li> Se zhig Mu la thogs med</li> <li> Se Nam mkha’ thogs med</li> <li> Se kho Nam mkha’ dbang phyug</li> <li> Se kho Ra rna mkha’ spyod</li> <li> Se sprul Tshe dbang mchog legs</li> </ol><p>At present, there is a monk called rTogs ldan bsTan ’dzin who was sixty-two years old. In spite of his being in the course of three years’ retreat, he was kind enough to grant us an exceptional audience. This monastery is counted as one of the large Bonpo monasteries in the Chab mdo region.</p><p>Before 1959, there were forty-four monks and at present there are forty-seven. This monastery now has an assembly hall, a temple and a meditation hall (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">sgrub khang</span>), all well designed and spacious. There are religious objects such as statues, scriptures and reliquary stupas.</p><p>As for annual services and daily activities, they follow the sMan ri tradition only. In the morning they say prayers, then they chant the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">Kun rig</span>, followed by more prayers. In the evening they perform the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">gsol kha</span> ritual to the protective deities, including Srid rgyal drel dmar. </p>",
