One can drive right up to the monastery.</p>\n\n                     <p>The monastery was founded in 1600 and is situated on the eastern side of the\n                        mountain Ma gling khrib bya ba. To the south-west of Ma gling khrib bya ba\n                        at sPa rdis steng, there is a large hermitage. To the left of the monastery\n                        is a holy mountain called Shugs chen, and in front is a big river called mDo\n                        chu, which comes from mDo gzhung, the upper part of the valley.</p>\n\n                     <p>In the 17th century, when the Be ri king ruled over the region, the master\n                        lCe tsha mKhar bu of Mi nyag became the prelate of the king. He established\n                        a hermitage on top of the mountain sPa rdis, halfway up the mountain Ma\n                        gling khrib bya ba.</p>\n\n                     <p>In 1641, the Mongol chief Gu shri Khan (of dGe lugs pa obedience), leading\n                        his horde, destroyed the monasteries of the bKa&rsquo; brgyud pa and Bonpo in the\n                        area, including rDis bon Monastery, and overthrew the Be ri king. Later,\n                        sTag gzhi bKa&rsquo; bo rgyal and Khram Tshe dbang rgyal po, who were disciples of\n                        Ba ya dKar &rsquo;dzang and had been hiding themselves when the Mongol horde was\n                        about in the region, rebuilt rDis bon Monastery and it became a fairly large\n                        establishment. Later, in bSod nams dbang ldan&rsquo;s time, there were two\n                        important residences (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">bla brang</span>) of lamas in the\n                        monastery, one was called rTse gzhung and the other Bla gzhung. There was a\n                        series of masters belonging to the Se family:</p>\n\n                     <ol type=\"1\">\n                        <li> Se zhig Mu la thogs med</li>\n\n                        <li> Se Nam mkha&rsquo; thogs med</li>\n\n                        <li> Se kho Nam mkha&rsquo; dbang phyug</li>\n\n                        <li> Se kho Ra rna mkha&rsquo; spyod</li>\n\n                        <li> Se sprul Tshe dbang mchog legs</li>\n                     </ol>\n\n                     <p>At present, there is a monk called rTogs ldan bsTan &rsquo;dzin who was sixty-two\n                        years old. In spite of his being in the course of three years&rsquo; retreat, he\n                        was kind enough to grant us an exceptional audience. This monastery is\n                        counted as one of the large Bonpo monasteries in the Chab mdo region.</p>\n\n                     <p>Before 1959, there were forty-four monks and at present there are\n                        forty-seven. This monastery now has an assembly hall, a temple and a\n                        meditation hall (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">sgrub khang</span>), all well designed and\n                        spacious.

In the morning they say prayers, then they chant the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">Kun rig</span>, followed by more prayers. In the evening they\n                        perform the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">gsol kha</span> ritual to the protective deities,\n                        including Srid rgyal drel dmar. </p>\n\n                     \n\n                        "},{"title":"The annual rituals are as follows:","index":3,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n\n                        <ol type=\"1\">\n                           <li> In the first Tibetan month the ritual of sTag la me &rsquo;bar is\n                              performed, followed by a five-day ritual of Phur pa.</li>\n\n                           <li> In the fifth month there are commemorations, the observance of the\n                              summer retreat, and the performance of rituals based on the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">Klong rgyas</span> and <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">rNam\n                              rgyal</span>.</li>\n\n                           <li> In the ninth month there is a performance of the ritual based on\n                              the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">Khro bo ngo mtshar rgyas pa</span> and the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">&rsquo;cham</span> dance of Khro bo.</li>\n                        </ol>\n\n                     \n\n                  "}]}
