With its sparse grasses, the site sees only limited pastoral use. The enclosure has been nearly obliterated; only scant traces of the east wall are still visible. The east wall is located 9.5 m east of the row of pillars, signaling that this was a medium-sized example of the typology. From what little remains, it appears hat the enclosure was heavily built. There are 16 unhewn pillars forming a modified U-shaped array.<\/p> "},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":null},{"title":"Site elements","index":6,"parent_index":2,"body":" "},{"title":"Pillars","index":7,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p>Most of the standing stones form a meandering north-south row near, what must have been, the west wall of the enclosure. The pillars are all tabular, around 10 cm thick and with some orange climax lichen growing on them. Eleven of them are more than 50 cm in height. In addition to the in situ specimens, there is a dislodged pillar 1 m in length at the site. The broad sides of most pillars face north and south, as is often the case in this ypology. Two pillars planted near, what must have been, the north wall of the enclosure, however, have broad sides oriented east and west. The tallest pillar occupies the central part of the north-south oriented row. It is 1.2 m in height and has a basal girth of 1.7 m. Three other stelae reach 1 m in height and have basal girths of between 1.2 m and 1.4 m. Seven other pillars are between 50 cm and 80 cm in height and have basal girths of between 70 cm and 1.4 m. A number of the pillars have had their tops broken off.<\/p>  "}]}
