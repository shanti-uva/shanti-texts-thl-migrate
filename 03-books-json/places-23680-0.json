The Chinese call the region Jiarong (\u5609\u620e). The people of Gyelrong identify as Tibetans and Tibetan religion is pervasive throughout the region, though the languages spoken in Gyelrong are not dialects of Tibetan but nonetheless are still part of the Tibeto-Burman language group. Gyelrong has long been one of the chief centers of the Tibetan B\u00f6n (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">bon<\/span><\/em>) religion and is home to many B\u00f6n monasteries and holy sites, as well as Buddhist institutions.<\/p><p>Politically, Gyelrong was comprised of eighteen principalities or kingdoms (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">rgyal rong rgyal khag bco brgyad<\/span><\/em>). The earliest history of the formation of these eighteen polities and their administration and interrelations remains to be researched. It appears, however, that there were ongoing territorial disputes among the principalities. Gyelrong exploded onto the Sino-Tibetan military landscape in the eighteenth century when the Qianlong emperor (1736-1795) embarked on two long and costly wars against two of Gyelrong\u2019s principalities. The enemies of the Qing army were the principalities of Rapten (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">rab brtan<\/span><\/em>) and Tsenlha (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">btsan lha<\/span><\/em>), known in Chinese as Da Jinchuan (\u5927\u91d1\u5ddd) and Xiao Jinchuan (\u5c0f\u91d1\u5ddd), respectively. Armies from several Kham polities with close ties to the Qing supported the wars with soldiers and supplies. The wars were precipitated by a Gyelrong attack on Qing soldiers in 1744. At this time the Manchu empire was very insecure about its control over the border regions and wanted to brutally retaliate against the offending principalities of Gyelrong in order to scare other frontier communities from further \u201crebellious\u201d actions. The first war lasted from 1747-1749. As the first war did not achieve the desired long-lasting suppression of Gyelrong, a second campaign was launched in 1771 and lasted until 1776. Unlike the first war, the second one had a pronounced sectarian component \u2013 instigated by the Geluk (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">dge lugs<\/span><\/em>) chaplain to the Qing emperor \u2013 that resulted in the conversion or destruction of all B\u00f6n temples and monasteries in Rapten.<\/p>","title":"An Overview of Gyelrong"}]}
