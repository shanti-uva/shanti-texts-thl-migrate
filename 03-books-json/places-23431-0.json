The <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">qu</span> is ninety kilometres\n                        north of the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">rdzong</span>, and the monastery is reached by\n                        travelling two hours further northward on horseback.</p>\n\n                     <p>In this nomad area of sGang ru, initially, a lama from Khyung po founded a\n                        monastery called Chu lung dgon, which, after a long time, declined. After\n                        that, another lama, also from Khyung po, founded a monastery in the same\n                        place and called it Na g-yang dgon, which also collapsed, having nobody to\n                        look after it. Thereafter, for a long period there was neither a communal\n                        leader nor a lama. Many believers longed for a new monastery to be\n                        built.</p>\n\n                     <p>At that time, however, there was a monk named Tshul khrims rgyal mtshan, who\n                        was the former chief teacher in gYung drung gling Monastery (No.2). He was\n                        himself a native of sGang ru. He had a great reputation as an accomplished\n                        scholar. After leaving his duty in gYung drung gling he devoted himself to\n                        meditation for eight years on the island of the lake Gyer ru mtsho. He had a\n                        close connection with the chief of the Kre ba tribe, one of the seven Sa\n                        skya tribes that inhabited the area around the lake gNam mtsho. The monks\n                        and laymen of the sGang ru Byang ma district held repeated discussions and\n                        sent bsTan pa lhun grub as a delegate to invite Tshul khrims rgyal mtshan,\n                        who, however, refused to accept the invitation. This left the people of\n                        sGang ru helpless. The following year, Tshe rab, the brother of Tshul khrims\n                        rgyal mtshan, appealed to him and this time he agreed to come.</p>\n\n                     <p>Tshul khrims rgyal mtshan returned on horseback to his native land. He\n                        looked for a good site and in 1957 he founded sGra rgyal Monastery in front\n                        of Mount Gung sman yul sa. This mountain had the look of a white conch and\n                        is situated at the back of the monastery.</p>\n\n                     <p>The monastery closely followed, in all its ceremonies, the tradition of\n                        gYung drung gling. There was the performance of the ritual cycle of Khro bo,\n                        the commemoration of sNang ston Zla ba rgyal mtshan and annual rituals such\n                        as the Zhi khro khri mchod and rNam rgyal stong mchod. The head of the\n                        monastery was lHa dge of Khyung nag. He was assisted by gDung pa me gsas and\n                        sKar yu.</p>\n\n                     <p>As for religious objects, the monastery possessed a gilt-bronze statue of\n                        rNam par rgyal ba, another statue of Sa trig er sangs and a complete\n                        manuscript set of the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">bKa&rsquo; &rsquo;gyur</span>. There was also a\n                        large gilt-bronze reliquary stupa of bZod pa rgyal mtshan, which bDud &rsquo;dul\n                        of Khyung po had had made.</p>\n\n                     <p>At present the monastery has fifty-five monks. It has several chapels and\n                        some religious objects.</p>\n\n                  "}]}
