It\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\treposes on a dark-colored sandstone and limestone outcrop, which rises 60 m above the valley bottom in a locale\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tknown as mug gyam. A small agricultural pocket was once located here.

The highest point of <span class=\"popular\">Balu Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ba lu mkhar</span> is occupied by a single, high-elevation stone and adobe\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tedifice. Its design characteristics (such as long spans between load-bearing structures and wall fabrics) indicate\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat it possessed a timber roof. This was a well-built, tall and robust structure, which clearly belonged to elite\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\taspects of ancient society. It was fortified by an elaborate series of defensive walls and outbuildings erected\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbelow. These ancillary buildings may have been all-stone structures. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Stones used in construction at <span class=\"popular\">Balu Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ba lu mkhar</span> are\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof variable size (generally 15 cm to 70 cm long).

The superstructure is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcomposed of brown sandstone slabs and blocks, a good many of which were hewn into shape. Standing stonewalls are\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\taround 65 cm thick. The forward or northeast side of the summit edifice has been leveled to its dry-mortar (?)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlimestone and sandstone revetment (up to 50 cm in height). The front of the building rises above a vertical\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcliff about 15 m in height. The southwest or rear of the summit edifice has a maximum interior height of 1.6 m\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand a maximum exterior height of 4 m, the difference being accounted for by the prominent revetment upon which\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe superstructure was built. Up to about 1.5 m in elevation, freestanding walls consist of slabs and blocks\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tembedded in a heavy mud/clay matrix. Above the stonework of the rear wall there are several highly degraded\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tadobe-block courses. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>There is a row of five rooms abutting the rear wall, comprising the upper tier of the summit edifice. The room\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpartitions against the rear wall are only partially intact. They are composed of adobe blocks that have been\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\treduced to around 15 cm in thickness. Along the southeast end of the rear wall there is a single room (4.2 m x\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3.9 m). Along the central portion of the rear wall there are two rooms (2.7 m x 3.8 m, 2.4 m x 3.7 m). There are\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\talso two rooms (1.3 m x 3.7 m, 1.5 m x 5 m) along the all-stone northwest end of the rear wall, which have an\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tearthen and stonework partition wall. The forward or northeast tier of the summit edifice probably consisted of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthree or four rooms. Only fractional footings are still extant in the forward portion of the building. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsoutheast and northwest faces of the summit edifice also rest upon high revetments (2 m to 2.5 m in height). </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>An axial corridor (around 1.3 m in width, running northwest-southeast) appears to have cut between the two\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttiers of rooms in the summit edifice. This corridor is situated 50 cm higher than the forward line of rooms and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tabout 1 m lower than the line of rear rooms. The entrance (90 cm wide) to the summit edifice is in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsoutheast. It is flanked by standing walls up to 2.5 m in height. On the northeast side of the entrance a few\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdissolving adobe blocks rest upon the stonework. The entranceway accesses a vestibule 3.3 m in length. Stairs\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmust have once been found in the entranceway in order to scale the approach to the building. The entrance hall\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tappears to have opened to a single room (3.4 m x 1.3 m) situated near the center of the floor plan. Only some of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tits footings are in place. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>There are six triangular loopholes in the southwest (rear) wall of the summit edifice, five of them punctuating\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tadobe courses and one (northwestern specimen) in stonework. These loopholes form a horizontal row. Two upright\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstones make up the sides of the loophole in the stone wall. There is also a triangular loophole in the southeast\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twall at the same height. The adobe-block southeast wall attains a height of nearly 2 m. On the northwest side of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe summit edifice, just below the base of the revetment, there is an isolated wall (2.4 m long, up to 1.8 m\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thigh), which may have been a defensive outwork of some kind. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Outlying structures","index":8,"parent_index":6,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Level 1 structures","index":9,"parent_index":8,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Just south of the summit edifice, on a saddle, there is a residential structure (4.6 m x 4.6 m) built as much\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tas 1.1 m into the ground.
