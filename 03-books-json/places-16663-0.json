These walls are oriented almost to the intermediate points. The enclosure measures 12 m (southwest-northeast) x 5.7 m (southeast-northwest). The double-course enclosure walls (50 cm to 70 cm thick) were constructed with variable-length (25 cm to 60 cm long) stones. Some of these stones are level with the ground surface while others project as much as 40 cm above it. </p> "},{"title":"Pillars","index":8,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p>All the pillars were erected near the inner edge of the southwest wall (they are mostly concentrated near the north corner) of the enclosure. Originally, there were at least eight pillars. These include seven tabular specimens, all of which are now 50 cm or less in height. At least three types of rocks were used as pillars, including a grayish grained type (igneous?) that was also used to construct the enclosure. Another type of rock is black in color. The main pillar of the site was broken about 40 cm above ground level. The broken upper section is 1.25 m long and has been propped back into position with the help of a pile of stones. This was part of an attempt by local residents to rehabilitate the site. The main pillar is irregularly shaped and has a girth of about 1 m. It is covered in butter and red ochre. This pillar is seasonally propitiated in invocation and offering rituals (<span class=\"popular emph\">solwa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">gsol ba</span>) by the local <span class=\"popular emph\">drok pa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">’brog pa</span>, who regard it as the sanctuary of a local divinity.<a href=\"#n32\" name=\"nb32\" class=\"note\">32</a> There are poles, with prayer flags attached, in the pile of rocks supporting the pillar.
