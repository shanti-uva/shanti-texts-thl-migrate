The walls of the enclosure are largely intact with the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\texception of the east wall. The sturdy perimeter walls are between 60 cm to 90 cm in thickness, and each\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconsists of parallel courses of slabs and cobbles. These stones are primarily 30 cm to 60 cm in length, and are\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tset flush with the surface or elevated above it to a maximum height of 20 cm. In the south wall there is one\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvery prominent stone, 1 m in length and rising 45 cm above-ground level. Mostly light-colored, fine-grained\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tigneous stones were used to build the enclosure, but there are a few white calcareous stones in the construction\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tas well.
