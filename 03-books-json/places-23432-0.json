It is at an altitude not less than 5,000 metres,\n                        and because of the difficulty the ascent presents to cars, one must go on\n                        foot from the bottom of the hill.</p>\n\n                     <p>The hermitage was established by rTogs ldan Tshul khrims dga&rsquo; ba in 1981 at\n                        a place where previously there was nothing but a cemetery and a small\n                        temple. At the spot backed by the holy mountain A krong and fronted with\n                        another holy mountain, Yi ge, he built a temple adorned with religious\n                        objects of body, speech and mind, and a mural of local deities of\n                        considerable quality. Although it is not very long since the hermitage was\n                        established, it has been a place of pilgrimage for many people because of\n                        the cemetery, which is regarded as very special.</p>\n\n                     <p>With regard to the way the monks perform funeral rites, they maintain the\n                        distinct traits of Bonpo tradition. Firstly, at the death of a person, the\n                        family invites a monk called the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">dbugs chad</span> lama, and\n                        then on the third day another monk called the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">zhag gsum</span>\n                        lama, to whom it presents a horse saddle. On the forty-ninth day the family\n                        invites a monk called the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">zhe dgu</span> lama. The funeral\n                        rite is based on the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">Kun rig</span>. Many flat, hand-sawn\n                        wooden boards are inscribed with scriptures in gold and silver to be burned\n                        in the cremation. So for the funeral rite, a rich family spends over 100,000\n                           <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">yuan</span> and one that is not so rich about 50,000. For\n                        very poor families, it has been a custom to leave the corpse strewn with\n                        barley flour up in the mountains.</p>\n\n                     <p>No more than three monks reside in this hermitage.</p>\n\n                  "}]}
