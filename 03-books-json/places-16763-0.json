Two dislodged stones at the enclosure are 1.5 m and 1.2 m in length.<\/li> <li>Funerary structure FS2 (11 m across) is situated 47 m south of FS1. FS2 was recently damaged and very little remains intact.<\/li> <li>Funerary structure FS3 is located immediately south of FS2. Three walls of this square enclosure are still partly intact. Aligned in the cardinal directions, FS3 measures 5.7 m (east-west) x 5.3 m (north-south). The variable-length (up to 85 cm long) stones of the walls are elevated 10 cm to 15 cm above ground level.<\/li> <li>Funerary structure FS 4 was a smaller enclosure of which little still remains (25.710\u0384 \/ 12.594\u0384 \/ 4460 m). It was recently shorn of stones. <\/li> <li>Funerary structures FS5, FS5, FS6, and FS7 formed a row 60 m in length (25.350\u0384 \/ 13.039\u0384 \/ 4470 m). Every single stone in these structures has been wrenched from the ground. These enclosures were composed of many larger stones (50 cm to 70 cm long). There are traces of other funerary superstructures of the same typology in he proximity. <\/li> <\/ol><p>A rectangular enclosure (6.3 m x 3.7 m) on the south side of <span class=\"popular\">Oma Tso<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">\u2019O ma mtsho<\/span> was built on level sandy ground (26.381\u0384 10.526\u0384 \/ 4460 m). More than 50 percent of stones in the enclosing walls were recently removed. In situ stones reach a maximum length of 70 cm and project as much as 30 cm above ground level. There is also reported to be a similar enclosure on the north side of <span class=\"popular\">Oma Tso<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">\u2019O ma mtsho<\/span> at a locale called <span class=\"popular\">Lorpuk<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Lor phug<\/span> (sp.?).<\/p>"}]}
