It is a mere sixty\n                        kilometres from the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">rdzong</span> to the village, but it is\n                        still a difficult distance to be travelled.</p>\n\n                     <p>There are no historical documents clearly recording the date of the\n                        monastery&rsquo;s establishment and there is little oral information. Still, based\n                        on the architectural aspect of the building, it is said to be one of the\n                        fairly old Bonpo monasteries.</p>\n\n                     <p>Before 1959, there were thirty monks, and at present thirty-two. The\n                        assembly hall, temple and religious objects are in quite good condition. The\n                        monastery&rsquo;s activities have no unique characteristics, but are much the same\n                        as other Bonpo monasteries.</p>\n\n                     <p>As for their source of income, the monks mainly receive support from their\n                        families and the occasional performance of religious services in the\n                        monastery or in villages.</p>\n\n                  "}]}
