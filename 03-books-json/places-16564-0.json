This conspicuous site, 40 m above the stream, is not particularly well protected; higher ground\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tflanks its south side. Very little of the sandstone ruins that once stood here remain &ndash; only small fragments of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trevetments. Most of the structures have long since poured down the steep slopes. There has also been a major slope\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfailure engulfing the north side of the summit, carrying away an unknown portion of the facility. Given its\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlocation, <span class=\"popular\">Riwa M&ouml;n Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ri ba mon mkhar</span> is likely to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thave been a palace and/or fortification. The summit is 21 m in length (southeast-northwest) but is now only 2 m to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3 m wide (clearly, at one time it was somewhat wider). While never a large installation, small structures extended\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tat least 5 m below the summit along the south side of the hill. On this south flank two revetment fragments have\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsurvived (7 m in length and up to 70 cm in height, 2.5 m in length). On the west side of the summit a revetment\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsegment 8 m in length is still in place, as well as a smaller wall fragment on the north rim of the summit. Stones\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin these walls reach a maximum length of 70 cm. Little else at the site remains in situ. Just south of <span class=\"popular\">Riwa M&ouml;n Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ri ba mon mkhar</span> there is an abandoned field. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>According to local lore, <span class=\"popular\">Riwa M&ouml;n Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ri ba mon mkhar</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twas an ancient <span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span> castle.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Affiliated sites","index":6,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Ri jo ba khang pa","index":7,"parent_index":6,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>On the east edge of <span class=\"popular\">Riwa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ri ba</span> there is an old house\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat reportedly belonged to the <span class=\"popular emph\">Ri Jowa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ri jo ba</span>, the foremost\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmembers of a special class of religious practitioners who were influential during the time of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBuddhist\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"popular\">Gug&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ge</span> kings.<a href=\"#n65\" name=\"nb65\" class=\"note\">65</a> It is also locally reported that this house was once owned by relatives of the third <span class=\"popular\">Karmapa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Karma pa</span>, <span class=\"popular\">Rangjung Dorj&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rang byung rdo rje</span> (born in <span class=\"popular\">Mangy&uuml;l Gungtang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mang yul gung thang</span> in 1284 CE).
