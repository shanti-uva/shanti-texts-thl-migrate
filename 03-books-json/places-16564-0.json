   "body": "<p>The ruins of <span class=\"popular\">Riwa Mön Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ri ba mon mkhar</span> are located upstream of <span class=\"popular\">Riwa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ri ba</span> village, on the top of a prominence that rises above the left bank of the <span class=\"popular\">Riwa Chu</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ri ba chu</span>. This conspicuous site, 40 m above the stream, is not particularly well protected; higher ground flanks its south side. Very little of the sandstone ruins that once stood here remain – only small fragments of revetments. Most of the structures have long since poured down the steep slopes. There has also been a major slope failure engulfing the north side of the summit, carrying away an unknown portion of the facility. Given its location, <span class=\"popular\">Riwa Mön Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ri ba mon mkhar</span> is likely to have been a palace and/or fortification. The summit is 21 m in length (southeast-northwest) but is now only 2 m to 3 m wide (clearly, at one time it was somewhat wider). While never a large installation, small structures extended at least 5 m below the summit along the south side of the hill. On this south flank two revetment fragments have survived (7 m in length and up to 70 cm in height, 2.5 m in length). On the west side of the summit a revetment segment 8 m in length is still in place, as well as a smaller wall fragment on the north rim of the summit. Stones in these walls reach a maximum length of 70 cm. Little else at the site remains in situ. Just south of <span class=\"popular\">Riwa Mön Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ri ba mon mkhar</span> there is an abandoned field. </p>
