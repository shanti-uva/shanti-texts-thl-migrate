The geography of the\n                  region however makes travel conditions difficult and the villages, which, for the\n                  most part, are scattered in the hills, are not easily accessible. The religious\n                  community of the area is composed of three distinct groups: Bonpo, rNying ma pa\n                  and dGe lugs pa. The Bonpo community consists of Bon brgya Monastery, fifteen\n                  village temples known as <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">gsas khang</span> and their adherents.</p>\n\n               <p>Since the Reb gong bon mang and Bon brgya Monastery share the same history, there\n                  is no need to repeat it here. Unfortunately, there is little information regarding\n                  the history of the fifteen <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">gsas khang</span>, probably owing to the\n                  spread and increasing influence of the monastic system. As a result Bon brgya\n                  Monastery has been the focus of attention, whereas the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">gsas\n                     khang</span>, whose importance has decreased in recent centuries, and which now\n                  merely function as a gathering place for practitioners, have not been the subject\n                  of any kind of written record. The <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">gsas khang</span> of Reb gong are\n                  divided into four groups:</p>\n\n               <ul xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n                  <li>1.

These include purification rituals for the\n                  past year and the calling of fortune and happiness for the coming year. The family\n                  welcomes the practitioners by blowing trumpets and Chinese bamboo flutes, and by\n                  firing firecrackers. The practitioners, led by the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">dbu mdzad</span>,\n                  perform the rituals inside each house. Each visit lasts around ten or fifteen\n                  minutes. The family offers the officiants a single fruit, usually an apple, as a\n                  symbolic offering.

During Khri srong lde btshan&rsquo;s\n                        time, Dran pa nam mkha&rsquo; lived in Reb gong and built a large monastery at A\n                        ba ngos bzang. During the time of King U dum btsan, because of the\n                        persecution of Bon, the three <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">grub thob</span>, (&ldquo;perfected\n                        beings&rdquo;)--all three brothers of the Khyung lineage-- fled from Central Tibet\n                        to Reb gong. They first stopped to rest at Chad lung thang, a short distance\n                        from the present site of Bon brgya Monastery. Later the three brothers\n                        established their residences in three villages in Reb gong &ndash;&rsquo;Khor lo bsgyur\n                        rgyal in sPyi sting village, Ye shes mtsho rgyal in Ngo mo village, and\n                        Khyung dkar tshang ba in Khyung bo village-- and began to propagate Bon in\n                        the region. Their descendents and spiritual heirs are still living in Reb\n                        gong (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">Bon brgya&rsquo;i gsung</span>, p.5). Around the same time, a\n                        Bonpo called dByings klong rin chen from sTong che in Khri ka arrived in Reb\n                        gong and married sTag ga&rsquo;i rGyal mo byams. Their descendents became the Bon\n                        brgya village that established itself in Bon brgya village in the valley of\n                        the same name. Several members of the village founded a hermitage at the\n                        site of the present monastery and formed the first religious community of\n                        Bon brgya Monastery. Other members eventually became nomads. Originally Bon\n                        brgya village comprised only twenty families but at present there are more\n                        than seven hundred families, including the nomad families (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">Bon brgya&rsquo;i gsung</span>, p.6) which altogether constitute the local lay\n                        community of the monastery. Although the monastery has a long history and is\n                        renowned for its many remarkable tantric practitioners and monks, its\n                        development as a monastic institution is fairly recent and probably does not\n                        go far back beyond the time of Bon brgya gYung drung phun tshogs who lived\n                        at the beginning of the twentieth century and who built the Don gnyis lhun\n                        grub lha khang with statues of the Three Buddhas of the Three Ages, rNam par\n                        rgyal ba, the Thousand Buddhas and a stupa (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">mchod rten</span>)\n                        dedicated to rNam par rgyal ba outside. Just as the statues and the stupa\n                        were being completed, Shar rdza bKra shis rgyal mtshan sent a letter to the\n                        monastery along with two hundred types of sacred objects (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">rten</span>) with which to fill the statues and then visited the monastery\n                        in person. This event created a sensation among the local community and\n                        marked the history of the monastery. Bon brgya gYung drung phun tshogs not\n                        only became a student of Khri rgan &rsquo;Jam dbyangs thub bstan rgya mtsho who\n                        was the teacher of the sixth Shang tshang (the religious and political head\n                        of Reb gong at the time) but also became close to the sixth Shang tshang\n                        himself. As a result, Bon brgya Monastery enjoyed a period of prosperity and\n                        development. Later, however, the monastery was damaged twice by the army of\n                        Ma Bufang, the warlord of Qinghai (Ma Bufang tongzhi Qinghai sishi nian). In\n                        1944, sKyang sprul Lung rtogs skal bzang rgya mtsho, a great master of mDzod\n                        dge, remained at the monastery for a year during which he visited many\n                        monasteries and <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">gsas khang</span> temples in the Kokonor area,\n                        giving teachings not only to the monks at the monastery but to all the Bonpo\n                        communities throughout the whole of Reb gong. Most monasteries and <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">gsas khang</span> in the Kokonor area payed hommage to him.\n                        During his visit to Reb gong in 1980, the tenth Panchen Lama proposed to\n                        rebuild Bon brgya Monastery and offered the monastery a statue of Amitabha\n                        together with one thousand and eight hundred Chinese Yuan for its\n                        reconstruction.

And then, rNam thar rgyal finally founded a Bonpo temple in the\n                     village called mTsho kha near Zhwa khra village and this was how Bon religion\n                     began to spread there.

In certain written sources, such\n                        as the biography of Khri ka Kung bzang rgyal mtshan, it is referred to as\n                        sTong chung and is associated with sTong che in Khri ka. Not sure whether my\n                        interpretation is correct: this association however seems to have been made\n                        by later scholars, because for the local population in both areas the\n                        distance between sTong che in Khri ka and sTong chung in Ba yan is\n                        considerable. The two monasteries probably found out about each other after\n                        most of the Bonpo religious sites in Amdo were converted to the dGe lugs pa\n                        tradition and Bonpo masters began travelling back and forth between the few\n                        Bonpo sanctuaries that remained. With the exception of the biography\n                        mentioned above, the site is not referred to as sTong chung, neither\n                        locally, nor by the people of sTong che. According to another source, there\n                        were two masters in sTong che known as sTon pa che ba and sTon pa chung ba,\n                        &ldquo;elder master&rdquo; and &ldquo;younger master&rdquo; and the terms evolved into sTon che and\n                        sTon chung. Thus sTon chung in Ba yan is supposed to have been named after\n                        the younger master who went there. This version seems to be rather\n                        farfetched, and since Khri ka Kun bzang rgyal mtshan is renowned as a\n                        scholar, his version of the name&rsquo;s origin is widely accepted, especially by\n                        the local Bonpo scholars.</p>\n\n                  \n\n                  \n\n                     "},{"title":"2.

There are no written Sources concerning the\n                        origin of Bon in sTong che. However, according to oral tradition, in the\n                        14th century Ye shes rgyal mtshan, a Bonpo monk from gYas ru dben sa kha\n                        Monastery and originally from Sog sde in Nag chu kha, asked his main master,\n                        mTha&rsquo; bral bSod nams rgyal mtshan, about his future. His master told him\n                        that he was to spread the doctrine in a land called gYang lung ra gsum in\n                        northern Amdo. Following his master&rsquo;s instructions, he left for Amdo in\n                        search of the place. The master gave Ye shes rgyal mtshan a reliquary for\n                        keeping sacred items exhorting him repeatedly not to open it before reaching\n                        his destination, but Ye shes rgyal mtshan&rsquo;s treasurer, overcome by\n                        curiosity, opened the reliquary on the way and a pigeon escaped from it. The\n                        bird was in fact dMag dpon, a guardian of the Bon religion, which is why, it\n                        is believed, dMag dpon is propitiated by the Bonpos living in Kokonor to\n                        this day. When they reached the shores of Kokonor lake they learnt that\n                        gYang lung ra gsum corresponded to the three valleys of Khri ka, and thus\n                        proceeded in that direction. When they reached sTong che valley, the mule\n                        carrying their belongings dropped to the ground. Ye shes rgyal mtshan took\n                        this as an auspicious sign. He decided that they would settle there and\n                        drove his <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">phur pa</span> dagger into the ground. The <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">gsas khang</span> he built on the spot became Khyung mo lha\n                        khang which survived until the middle of the 20th century. (The temple was\n                        built in the old architectural style with the three Buddhas of the Three\n                        Ages at the entrance flanked by eight <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">sems dpa&rsquo;</span> on\n                        either side). The temple is the earliest of its kind in Amdo; indeed, since\n                        Ye shes rgyal mtshan arrived there from central Tibet, the temple was built\n                        in the original, central Tibetan style. Ye shes rgyal mtshan became renowned\n                        as sTong che ston pa, also called Sog btsun ston pa, the &ldquo;monk from Sog sde&rdquo;\n                        (in Amdo). He also built a monastery at the site of the present dPon tshang\n                        lha khang, but since its location in the center of the village was\n                        inconvenient, it was moved to the present site of Khyung mo Monastery a few\n                        generations after its foundation. It was during this period that the first\n                        temples in sTong che valley were founded: sBra ser lha khang, dPon tshang\n                        lha khang and sKa rgya stong skor spyi khang. </p>\n\n                     <p>A lags Khyung mo is the most important reincarnation of the monastery.\n                        According to legend, A lags Khyung mo was a lama who practised the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">&rsquo;pho ba grong &rsquo;jug</span>, &ldquo;tranferring the soul from one body\n                        to another&rdquo;.

The Indian\n                        lineage was discontinued when sKar ma mdo sde, the son of Mar pa <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">lo tsa ba</span>, was killed by Rwa <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">lo tsa\n                           ba</span>. A lags Khyung-mo is said to belong to the Chinese lineage. The\n                        third A lags Khyung mo Kun dga&rsquo; rgyal mtshan received the teaching of <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">&rsquo;pho ba grong &rsquo;jug</span> from Rong sgom rTog med zhig po, a\n                        master of the lHo yang ston lineage and initiated the practice of <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">&rsquo;pho ba grong &rsquo;jug</span> within the Khyung mo lineage. Kun\n                        bzang rgyal mtshan was born to the Khyung po village in Nag chu kha and was\n                        the son of the King of Hor (Hor spyi khyab rgyal po). </p>\n\n                     <p>The elder people in the village remember that the eighteenth A lags Khyung\n                        mo was a Chinese man from Ziling (Xining), who came to Khyung mo Monastery\n                        and claimed to be the embodiment of the previous A lags Khyung mo who\n                        practised the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">&rsquo;pho ba grong &rsquo;jug</span>. The monastery, after\n                        having investigated the matter, confirmed his claim and he was enthroned at\n                        the monastery. This took place sometime in the early 20th century. The\n                        present A lags Khyung mo, sTobs ldan dbang phyug, was recognized by rGyal\n                        &rsquo;obs Rinpoche of sNang zhig Monastery of rNga khog.

The image is regarded as the\n                        emblem of the Bonpo community throughout Amdo. As a result, it has been\n                        copied in many temples and monasteries in Amdo. </p>\n\n                     <p>In the lineage of rTse zhig Lama of rTse zhig Monastery, there was a master\n                        called Shes rab, more commonly known as A lags Shes rab, who became the\n                        master of many temples and monasteries in Amdo including those in sTong che.\n                        He had several temples and a residence built in sTong che Monastery. He\n                        named the monastery gYung drung phun tshogs gling. Shes rab rnam rgyal, his\n                        nephew, travelled to Central Tibet where he lived and studied as a monk at\n                        sMan ri Monastery in gTsang. His aging uncle grew very sad for he was afraid\n                        he might never see his nephew again, so rGyal ba, a monk at Khyung mo\n                        Monastery, went to sMan ri to ask Shes rab rnam rgyal to return. The latter\n                        accepted and thus uncle and nephew were reunited. Shes rab rnam rgyal also\n                        developed close ties with the sixth Panchen Lama, dPal ldan ye shes\n                        (1738-1780), who offered him a title and seal investing him with authority\n                        over all the Bonpo communities throughout Amdo (KTGN, p.fol.9), and he\n                        became known as rTse zhig Drung rams pa. </p>\n\n                     <p>He frequently returned to Khyung mo Monastery. From that time onwards, the\n                        masters of the rTse zhig lineage have been in charge of Khyung mo Monastery,\n                        and some among them as <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">khri ba</span> of the monastery even\n                        had a permanent residence there. Later, gYung drung bstan rgyas and rTse\n                        dbus rGyal ba tshul khrims from rTse zhig Monastery also put a lot of effort\n                        into the monastery. </p>\n\n                     <p>Until the mid-20th century, monastery had three temples, one known as the\n                        dPon tshang gsas khang was built by dBang rgyal, a chief of sTong che\n                        valley, as an act of repentence for the killing of the seven brothers of Sha\n                        kya village by the Tsha kho army. According to legend, when gYung drung lha\n                        steng Monastery was destroyed by Chinese forces during the Manchu dynasty an\n                        orphan child from rGyal rong was adopted by a Chinese officer. When the boy\n                        grew up and became an officer like his adopted father, he asked permission\n                        to destroy one hundred and eight dGe lugs pa monasteries to take revenge on\n                        the dGe lugs pa for destroying gYung drung lha steng Monastery. Permission\n                        was granted and he was given the troops stationed at rGyal rong --known by\n                        the people of Khri ka as the Tsha kho army)-- to assist him in his task.\n                        When the troops finally arrived in sTong che valley to destroy Ba rgya\n                        Monastery, the last of the one hundred and eight dGe lugs pa monasteries\n                        located near Khyung mo Monastery, they met stiff resistence from the Sha kya\n                        village, the patron family of Ba rgya Monastery and their people. In the end\n                        only the Sha kya&rsquo;s stag bdun (&ldquo;seven tigers of Sha kya village&rdquo;), in other\n                        words, the seven brothers of the village, were left to defend the monastery.\n                        The brothers took refuge in a castle to make their last defense. At this\n                        juncture the chief of sTong che proposed to act as mediator between the\n                        seven brothers and the Tsha kho troops and obtained from the latter the\n                        promise that the brothers would not be killed if they surrendered to the\n                        army.
