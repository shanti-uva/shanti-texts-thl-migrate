The geography of the region however makes travel conditions difficult and the villages, which, for the most part, are scattered in the hills, are not easily accessible. The religious community of the area is composed of three distinct groups: Bonpo, rNying ma pa and dGe lugs pa. The Bonpo community consists of Bon brgya Monastery, fifteen village temples known as <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">gsas khang<\/span> and their adherents.<\/p> <p>Since the Reb gong bon mang and Bon brgya Monastery share the same history, there is no need to repeat it here. Unfortunately, there is little information regarding the history of the fifteen <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">gsas khang<\/span>, probably owing to the spread and increasing influence of the monastic system. As a result Bon brgya Monastery has been the focus of attention, whereas the <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">gsas khang<\/span>, whose importance has decreased in recent centuries, and which now merely function as a gathering place for practitioners, have not been the subject of any kind of written record. The <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">gsas khang<\/span> of Reb gong are divided into four groups:<\/p> <ul xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"list-style-type: none;\"> <li>1.

Bon brgya Trulku dGe legs lhun grub rgya mtsho is the master of all the Reb gong bon mang. Stod phyogs and sMad phyogs are the Reb gong bon mang&rsquo;s two largest groups. The two <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">gsas khang<\/span> of the Yar nang bon mang group function independently, not only from the rest of the Reb gong bon mang, but also from one another, and do not participate in any of the other group&rsquo;s collective activities. sNyan bzang bon mang joins sMad phyogs bon mang for major religious activities. Thus for the main ceremonies, the four groups of Reb gong merge into two groups under the leadership of sTod phyogs bon mang and sMad phyogs bon mang.<\/p> <p>The rituals celebrated by the Reb gong bon mang may be divided into four categories: <\/p> <ol type=\"1\"> <li> Two major annual rituals celebrated collectively by the entire Reb gong bon mang with the exception of Yar nang bon mang: the spring ritual (5th to 8th day of the 1st month) and the autumn ritual (8th to 10th day of the 10th month). <\/li> <\/ol> <p>The preparations take one day so the practitioners gather on the day before, and those (especially the elderly) living in the remoter villages usually arrive a day before that and spend the night with families near the <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">gsas khang<\/span> where the ritual is to take place. The main practice is that of the dBal gsas cycle, as well as a short version of the &rsquo;Bum pa and sTag la ritual cycles. Each of the <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">gsas khang<\/span> hosts the rituals on a rotational basis. The<span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"> gsas khang<\/span> of Reb gong bon mang are conceived of and function as a whole, rather than as separate institutions, and share a common hierarchical system: two <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">dge bskos<\/span>, disciplinarian appointed for one year, one <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">dbu mdzad<\/span>, incantation master appointed for three years; one <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">khri pa<\/span>, leader and one <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">gnyer pa<\/span>, a treasurer appointed for one year; and one <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">g-yung drung slob dpon<\/span>, an officiator who is replaced every three years. One of the <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">dge bskos<\/span> must belong to the sTod phyogs bon mang, and the other from sMad phyogs bon mang, these two groups being the largest of the Reb gong bon mang&rsquo;s four groups. In addition, there is one <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">dbu mdzad<\/span> who leads the chanting during ceremonies. The <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">khri pa<\/span> is the head of the whole Bon mang, and is also responsible for organizing the spring ritual while the <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">gnyer pa<\/span> is responsible for organizing the autumn ritual. During the rituals the throne of the <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">khri pa<\/span> is placed at the same level as that of Bon brgya Trulku. Even in his absence, the <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">khri pa<\/span> is honoured by the presence of his throne. The <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">g-yung drung slob dpon<\/span> is responsible for every ritual.<\/p> <ol type=\"1\"> <li> The next major ceremony is the ritual dedicated to the <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">Yi dam Kun &rsquo;dus<\/span> which takes place from the 10th to the 13th day of the 5th month. The <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">gsas khang<\/span> host the ritual in turn. Participants must be over twenty-nine years old. The <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">dbu mdzad<\/span> for this ritual is selected for three years. The <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">g-yung drung slob dpon<\/span> and <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">khri pa<\/span> are the same as for the above-mentioned rituals. A separate <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">gnyer pa<\/span> is also appointed since the organiztion of the ritual requires a considerable amount of time and effort.<\/li> <li> The third category comprises the <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">mKha&rsquo; &rsquo;gro gsang gcod<\/span> and <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">Zhi khro<\/span>. The former is held from the 1st to the 4th day of the 4th month, and the latter from the 1st to the 4th day of the 5th month. The two rituals are performed by both the sTod phyogs bon mang and the sMad phyogs bon mang separately (see below). Other rituals performed by the groups separately include rituals dedicated to Tshe dbang, Kun bzang, dBal gsas and &rsquo;Bum pa (25th - 30th day of the 11th month), performed by the sTod phyogs bon mang, and rituals dedicated to Kun bzang, Tshe dbang and dBal gsas (17th - 20th day of the 10th month), performed by the sMad phyogs bon mang. <\/li> <li>The three-year <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">dbu mdzad<\/span> cycle dedicated to <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">Yi dam kun &rsquo;dus<\/span> ritual must be led by the <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">dbu mdzad<\/span> of one of the two ritual groups of Reb gong Bon mang to which he belongs, and the other group ought to find another one to be the <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">dbu mdzad<\/span> for themeselves. They also ought to find two new <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">gnyer pa<\/span> for the two groups. Both groups do not have a leader (<span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">khri pa<\/span>) nor a ritual master (<span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">g-yung drung slob dpon)<\/span> for the rituals they perform.<\/li> <li>These rituals do not require the presence of the <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">khri pa<\/span> and <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">g-yung drung slob dpon<\/span>, but the <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">khri pa<\/span> of Reb gong bon mang must be honoured by his throne, and two experienced practitioners are selected to occupy the first two seats of the front row and to take on the role of the <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">g-yung drung slob dpon<\/span>.<\/li> <li> The fourth category of ritual includes those performed by the <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">gsas khang<\/span> individually. All the<span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"> gsas khang<\/span> perform a ritual on the 10th of each month, in addition to other rituals on different dates that are listed in the descriptions of the <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">gsas khang<\/span> below.<\/li> <\/ol> <p>The position of each practitioner in the collective rituals of the Reb gong bon mang is very important. I will describe here the order I observed when I attended the spring ritual in 1998 at the <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">gsas khang<\/span> of Hor nag la ga village.<\/p> <p>The two front rows and their tables are always very attractive during rituals. The two <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">bang kha<\/span> occupy the first two seats at the head of the front row; <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">bang kha<\/span> is supposed to be a Zhang zhung word for master of the sphere (Tib. <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">dkyil &rsquo;khor gyi bdag po<\/span>). One of them must be the <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">sgrub dpon<\/span>, the ritual&rsquo;s consultant or advisor. Prior to the nineteen-fifties, the two <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">bang kha<\/span> had to guard the <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">gtor ma<\/span> representing the tutelary deities (<span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">yi dam<\/span>) and protective deities (<span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">bon skyong<\/span>) placed on the table between the thrones of Bon brgya Trulku and the <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">khi pa<\/span> day and night, but at present their presence is required only during the day. The two <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">bang kha<\/span> must be experienced tantric practitioners, and are therefore usually elderly personages respected by the whole community. The <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">dbu mdzad<\/span> and <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">g-yung drung slob dpon<\/span> sit in the center of the two front rows. The <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">dbu mdzad<\/span>&rsquo;s seat is higher than the others but lower than the thrones of the Trulku and the <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">khri pa<\/span>. The seats between the two <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">bang kha<\/span> at the head of the row and the <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">dbu mdzad<\/span> and <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">g-yung drung slob dpon<\/span> in the middle are reserved for the elder practitioners, usually former officials of the Reb gong bon mang with a reputation as experienced and powerful tantric practitioners. The seats between the <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">g-yung drung slob dpon<\/span> and <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">dbu mdzad<\/span> in the center and the musicians at the end of the row are occupied by those who chant best. The rows behind are occupied by the other practitioners. New practitioners attend the ceremony from the back seats.<\/p> <p>The ritual is followed by the <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">sde &rsquo;bod<\/span>, invitation of the village, during which the villagers invite the practitioners to their homes to perform rituals for their families. These include purification rituals for the past year and the calling of fortune and happiness for the coming year. The family welcomes the practitioners by blowing trumpets and Chinese bamboo flutes, and by firing firecrackers. The practitioners, led by the <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">dbu mdzad<\/span>, perform the rituals inside each house. Each visit lasts around ten or fifteen minutes. The family offers the officiants a single fruit, usually an apple, as a symbolic offering. Since the villagers wait several years for this occasion, the practitioners must perform the <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">sde bod<\/span> regardless of the time it takes (sometimes the visits are not completed until well after dark).<\/p> <p>Since Bon brgya Trulku is the head of both Bon brgya Monastery -- which is the only Bonpo monastery in Reb gong -- and the Reb gong bon mang, the influence of the monastic system in the area is growing stronger. <\/p> "},{"title":"(100) Bon brgya Monastery","index":3,"parent_index":2,"body":" "},{"title":"1.

History","index":6,"parent_index":3,"body":" <p>There are no reliable written records concerning the origins of the Bon religion in the Reb gong area, but according to oral tradition, one of the &ldquo;six great universal scholars&rdquo; (&rsquo;Dzam gling rgyan drug), Phrom gSer thog lce &rsquo;byams, a Bonpo from Phrom, spread Bon in his homeland, at a time corresponding to the earlier spread of Bon. During Khri srong lde btshan&rsquo;s time, Dran pa nam mkha&rsquo; lived in Reb gong and built a large monastery at A ba ngos bzang. During the time of King U dum btsan, because of the persecution of Bon, the three <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">grub thob<\/span>, (&ldquo;perfected beings&rdquo;)--all three brothers of the Khyung lineage-- fled from Central Tibet to Reb gong. They first stopped to rest at Chad lung thang, a short distance from the present site of Bon brgya Monastery. Later the three brothers established their residences in three villages in Reb gong &ndash;&rsquo;Khor lo bsgyur rgyal in sPyi sting village, Ye shes mtsho rgyal in Ngo mo village, and Khyung dkar tshang ba in Khyung bo village-- and began to propagate Bon in the region. Their descendents and spiritual heirs are still living in Reb gong (<span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">Bon brgya&rsquo;i gsung<\/span>, p.5). Around the same time, a Bonpo called dByings klong rin chen from sTong che in Khri ka arrived in Reb gong and married sTag ga&rsquo;i rGyal mo byams. Their descendents became the Bon brgya village that established itself in Bon brgya village in the valley of the same name. Several members of the village founded a hermitage at the site of the present monastery and formed the first religious community of Bon brgya Monastery. Other members eventually became nomads. Originally Bon brgya village comprised only twenty families but at present there are more than seven hundred families, including the nomad families (<span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">Bon brgya&rsquo;i gsung<\/span>, p.6) which altogether constitute the local lay community of the monastery. Although the monastery has a long history and is renowned for its many remarkable tantric practitioners and monks, its development as a monastic institution is fairly recent and probably does not go far back beyond the time of Bon brgya gYung drung phun tshogs who lived at the beginning of the twentieth century and who built the Don gnyis lhun grub lha khang with statues of the Three Buddhas of the Three Ages, rNam par rgyal ba, the Thousand Buddhas and a stupa (<span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">mchod rten<\/span>) dedicated to rNam par rgyal ba outside. Just as the statues and the stupa were being completed, Shar rdza bKra shis rgyal mtshan sent a letter to the monastery along with two hundred types of sacred objects (<span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">rten<\/span>) with which to fill the statues and then visited the monastery in person. This event created a sensation among the local community and marked the history of the monastery. Bon brgya gYung drung phun tshogs not only became a student of Khri rgan &rsquo;Jam dbyangs thub bstan rgya mtsho who was the teacher of the sixth Shang tshang (the religious and political head of Reb gong at the time) but also became close to the sixth Shang tshang himself. As a result, Bon brgya Monastery enjoyed a period of prosperity and development. Later, however, the monastery was damaged twice by the army of Ma Bufang, the warlord of Qinghai (Ma Bufang tongzhi Qinghai sishi nian). In 1944, sKyang sprul Lung rtogs skal bzang rgya mtsho, a great master of mDzod dge, remained at the monastery for a year during which he visited many monasteries and <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">gsas khang<\/span> temples in the Kokonor area, giving teachings not only to the monks at the monastery but to all the Bonpo communities throughout the whole of Reb gong. Most monasteries and <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">gsas khang<\/span> in the Kokonor area payed hommage to him. During his visit to Reb gong in 1980, the tenth Panchen Lama proposed to rebuild Bon brgya Monastery and offered the monastery a statue of Amitabha together with one thousand and eight hundred Chinese Yuan for its reconstruction. Official permission was granted by the local government the following year; the first buildings to be reconstructed were the Don gnyis lhun grub lha khang and the residence of Bon brgya Trulku.

Nobody seems to remember his real name today. He had a Ma ni khang built in Zhwa khra village when he came back from Lhasa, and the Ma ni khang was shared by both Buddhist and Bonpo people for centuries. The date of the foundation is not clear, but, according to dBang grags, a retired leader of gCan tsha county and comes from Zhwa khra village, and some old Bonpo such as Padma Tsering who were from the village as well, the Ma ni khang was founded about eight generations ago. <\/p> <p>A lay Bonpo tantric called rNam thar rgyal had a statue and thangka of the divinity dBal gsas made in the Ma ni khang, and so tantrics of both Buddhists and Bonpo practised together for many years.<\/p> <p>Today, there are eighteen lay tantrics in the Ma ni khang. They practise both Buddhism and Bon relgion. Ma ni khang has forty-two families as its local community. And then, rNam thar rgyal finally founded a Bonpo temple in the village called mTsho kha near Zhwa khra village and this was how Bon religion began to spread there. The temple was damaged in middle of the twentieth century and has not been yet rebuilt.<\/p> <p>Another Bonpo lay tantric called rDo rje founded a new and small Bonpo temple separately in Zhwa khra village in the second half of the twentieth century to follow rNam thar rgyal&rsquo;s example. rDo rje has his family and a few followers.

History","index":200,"parent_index":197,"body":" <p>Literary Sources: in addition to sBra ser <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">Pandita<\/span> Kun bzang rgyal mtshan&rsquo;s unfinished autobiograghy, there are two more recent texts by sNying sangs rgyal and sBra ser Tshangs dbyangs. sBra ser Pandita, also known as Khri ka Kun bzang rgyal mtshan (or by his secret name Nam mkha&rsquo; dbang phyug) was a learned monk from sBra ser Monastery overlooking the village of the same name. There are no written Sources concerning the origin of Bon in sTong che. However, according to oral tradition, in the 14th century Ye shes rgyal mtshan, a Bonpo monk from gYas ru dben sa kha Monastery and originally from Sog sde in Nag chu kha, asked his main master, mTha&rsquo; bral bSod nams rgyal mtshan, about his future. His master told him that he was to spread the doctrine in a land called gYang lung ra gsum in northern Amdo. Following his master&rsquo;s instructions, he left for Amdo in search of the place. The master gave Ye shes rgyal mtshan a reliquary for keeping sacred items exhorting him repeatedly not to open it before reaching his destination, but Ye shes rgyal mtshan&rsquo;s treasurer, overcome by curiosity, opened the reliquary on the way and a pigeon escaped from it. The bird was in fact dMag dpon, a guardian of the Bon religion, which is why, it is believed, dMag dpon is propitiated by the Bonpos living in Kokonor to this day. When they reached the shores of Kokonor lake they learnt that gYang lung ra gsum corresponded to the three valleys of Khri ka, and thus proceeded in that direction. When they reached sTong che valley, the mule carrying their belongings dropped to the ground. Ye shes rgyal mtshan took this as an auspicious sign. He decided that they would settle there and drove his <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">phur pa<\/span> dagger into the ground. The <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">gsas khang<\/span> he built on the spot became Khyung mo lha khang which survived until the middle of the 20th century. (The temple was built in the old architectural style with the three Buddhas of the Three Ages at the entrance flanked by eight <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">sems dpa&rsquo;<\/span> on either side). The temple is the earliest of its kind in Amdo; indeed, since Ye shes rgyal mtshan arrived there from central Tibet, the temple was built in the original, central Tibetan style. Ye shes rgyal mtshan became renowned as sTong che ston pa, also called Sog btsun ston pa, the &ldquo;monk from Sog sde&rdquo; (in Amdo). He also built a monastery at the site of the present dPon tshang lha khang, but since its location in the center of the village was inconvenient, it was moved to the present site of Khyung mo Monastery a few generations after its foundation. It was during this period that the first temples in sTong che valley were founded: sBra ser lha khang, dPon tshang lha khang and sKa rgya stong skor spyi khang. <\/p> <p>A lags Khyung mo is the most important reincarnation of the monastery. According to legend, A lags Khyung mo was a lama who practised the <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">&rsquo;pho ba grong &rsquo;jug<\/span>, &ldquo;tranferring the soul from one body to another&rdquo;. There are two lineages of the practice of <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">&rsquo;pho ba grong &rsquo;jug<\/span>, one from India and the other from China. The Indian lineage was discontinued when sKar ma mdo sde, the son of Mar pa <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">lo tsa ba<\/span>, was killed by Rwa <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">lo tsa ba<\/span>. A lags Khyung-mo is said to belong to the Chinese lineage. The third A lags Khyung mo Kun dga&rsquo; rgyal mtshan received the teaching of <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">&rsquo;pho ba grong &rsquo;jug<\/span> from Rong sgom rTog med zhig po, a master of the lHo yang ston lineage and initiated the practice of <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">&rsquo;pho ba grong &rsquo;jug<\/span> within the Khyung mo lineage. Kun bzang rgyal mtshan was born to the Khyung po village in Nag chu kha and was the son of the King of Hor (Hor spyi khyab rgyal po). <\/p> <p>The elder people in the village remember that the eighteenth A lags Khyung mo was a Chinese man from Ziling (Xining), who came to Khyung mo Monastery and claimed to be the embodiment of the previous A lags Khyung mo who practised the <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">&rsquo;pho ba grong &rsquo;jug<\/span>. The monastery, after having investigated the matter, confirmed his claim and he was enthroned at the monastery. This took place sometime in the early 20th century. The present A lags Khyung mo, sTobs ldan dbang phyug, was recognized by rGyal &rsquo;obs Rinpoche of sNang zhig Monastery of rNga khog.

He was also a painter. A large <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">zhing bkod<\/span> type of thangka depicting &rsquo;Ol mo lung ring, the Bonpo sacred land in sTag gzig, is attributed to him. The image is regarded as the emblem of the Bonpo community throughout Amdo. As a result, it has been copied in many temples and monasteries in Amdo. <\/p> <p>In the lineage of rTse zhig Lama of rTse zhig Monastery, there was a master called Shes rab, more commonly known as A lags Shes rab, who became the master of many temples and monasteries in Amdo including those in sTong che. He had several temples and a residence built in sTong che Monastery. He named the monastery gYung drung phun tshogs gling. Shes rab rnam rgyal, his nephew, travelled to Central Tibet where he lived and studied as a monk at sMan ri Monastery in gTsang. His aging uncle grew very sad for he was afraid he might never see his nephew again, so rGyal ba, a monk at Khyung mo Monastery, went to sMan ri to ask Shes rab rnam rgyal to return. The latter accepted and thus uncle and nephew were reunited. Shes rab rnam rgyal also developed close ties with the sixth Panchen Lama, dPal ldan ye shes (1738-1780), who offered him a title and seal investing him with authority over all the Bonpo communities throughout Amdo (KTGN, p.fol.9), and he became known as rTse zhig Drung rams pa. <\/p> <p>He frequently returned to Khyung mo Monastery. From that time onwards, the masters of the rTse zhig lineage have been in charge of Khyung mo Monastery, and some among them as <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">khri ba<\/span> of the monastery even had a permanent residence there. Later, gYung drung bstan rgyas and rTse dbus rGyal ba tshul khrims from rTse zhig Monastery also put a lot of effort into the monastery. <\/p> <p>Until the mid-20th century, monastery had three temples, one known as the dPon tshang gsas khang was built by dBang rgyal, a chief of sTong che valley, as an act of repentence for the killing of the seven brothers of Sha kya village by the Tsha kho army. According to legend, when gYung drung lha steng Monastery was destroyed by Chinese forces during the Manchu dynasty an orphan child from rGyal rong was adopted by a Chinese officer. When the boy grew up and became an officer like his adopted father, he asked permission to destroy one hundred and eight dGe lugs pa monasteries to take revenge on the dGe lugs pa for destroying gYung drung lha steng Monastery. Permission was granted and he was given the troops stationed at rGyal rong --known by the people of Khri ka as the Tsha kho army)-- to assist him in his task. When the troops finally arrived in sTong che valley to destroy Ba rgya Monastery, the last of the one hundred and eight dGe lugs pa monasteries located near Khyung mo Monastery, they met stiff resistence from the Sha kya village, the patron family of Ba rgya Monastery and their people. In the end only the Sha kya&rsquo;s stag bdun (&ldquo;seven tigers of Sha kya village&rdquo;), in other words, the seven brothers of the village, were left to defend the monastery. The brothers took refuge in a castle to make their last defense. At this juncture the chief of sTong che proposed to act as mediator between the seven brothers and the Tsha kho troops and obtained from the latter the promise that the brothers would not be killed if they surrendered to the army. No sooner had the brothers surrendered than they were killed. Since the chief had urged the brothers to surrender he felt responsible for their deaths and built the temple as an act of repentence. We do not know the exact dates of these events, but the story is still well-known today.<\/p> <p>In the eighteen-nineties permission was granted for the monastery&rsquo;s reconstruction.<\/p> "},{"title":"4.
