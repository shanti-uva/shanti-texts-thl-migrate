This is in contrast to a reconstruction, which intends to rebuild from scratch a building which has been completely or nearly completely destroyed; a renovation, which seeks to alter an existing building, but not necessarily return it to some previously existing state; and a repair, which intends to repair damage to an existing building, but again not necessarily return it to some previously existing state.</p>",
