They perform the common daily activities. There are no rituals or services specific to this monastery. The monks\u2019 main source of income is, much the same as in other poor Bonpo monasteries, financial support from their own parents or relatives. The monastery itself has no means of generating revenue. Occasionally the monks are invited to perform religious services, such as funerals, in villages, which helps supplement their income.<\/p><p>Proceeding north from mDzo sgang rdzong by car, through the grassland of sPom mda\u2019, where an airfield is situated, and along the river rGyal mo rngul chu, one arrives at dPa\u2019 shod rdzong. Driving from mDzo sgang rdzong to dPa\u2019 shod rdzong takes six and a half hours. When we reached the district of dPa\u2019 shod rdzong, the way had been blocked to traffic by road construction, which prevented us from proceeding. After a long wait of five and a half hours, the road was finally opened.<\/p>"}]}
