The rear wall of the south building was built into the slope to a depth of 1 m. It appears to have contained a single room as there are no partition walls visible. The south building has the long, straight walls of a structure built with a timber roof. <\/p> "},{"title":"Middle complex","index":10,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p>The middle complex is situated 7 m directly below the upper complex.

The north building (9 m x 4.7 m) appears to have been partitioned into a single row of three rooms. In the south wall, which reaches a height of 2.7 m, there is a window opening (25 cm x 25 cm). The forward wall has been reduced to the revetment and freestanding fragments (a maximum of 50 cm in height). The forward wall has a total maximum height of 2 m. In the south room there are two small niches in the rear wall and in the rear wall of the middle room there is a larger niche. The south room is only 1.5 m in width and between it and the middle room there is an intervening 60-cm- to 80-cm-thick curved partition wall. There is a 90 cm gap between the south and middle rooms. The total length of the south and middle rooms is 5.5 m (north-south). The middle room is 3 m in width. At the foot of the revetment, below the middle room, there is a cavity (40 cm x 45 cm x 40 cm). The design features (heavy wall buttressing, room alignments and ground plan) of the south and middle rooms of the north building indicate that they were built with a stone roof. The north room of the north building is now little more than a section of revetment against the forward slope. The north room was narrower than the adjoining rooms.<\/p> "},{"title":"Lower complex","index":13,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p>The lower complex consists of a single building divided into two rooms, which measures 8.4 m (north-south) x 3.8 m (east-west). The forward wall is over 2 m in height and is comprised mainly of a revetment. Freestanding walls have been mostly obliterated. From the available structural evidence, it could not be determined whether his structure had a stone or timber roof. <\/p> "},{"title":"Shrine","index":14,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p>At the northwest or upper end of <span class=\"popular\">Khangpa Mar Gok<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Khang pa dmar gog<\/span> there is a cubic structure (1.3 m x 1.3 m). It is situated 44 m north of the upper complex at 7 m higher elevation. On its downhill flank, this structure is 70 cm in height while its uphill side is flush with the slope. Such semi-subterranean aspect shrines are fairly common at the archaic residential centers of Upper Tibet, and are likely to have been used in the worship of elemental deities. On the top of the ruined ceremonial structure there is an old carved plaque. <\/p>  "}]}
