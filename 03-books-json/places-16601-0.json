These three\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcomplexes have analogous constructional features and degradation characteristics, suggesting that they formed an\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tintegral site in terms of function and chronology.

The brown\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstones used in construction were mostly unworked, and tend to be smaller (10 cm to 40 cm in length), but longer\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\texamples are also found in the wall fabric.
