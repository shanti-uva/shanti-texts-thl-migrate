The <span class=\"popular\">Nyerma Gyam</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gnyer ma gyam</span> ridge overlooks the north side of <span class=\"popular\">Gunggyüd Tso</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gung rgyud mtsho</span>. The site consists of a series of <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma ṇi</span> walls, two of which appear to be modified funerary structures. These six <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma ṇi</span> walls sit on three dark-colored rock outcrops situated at different elevations. The inscribed plaques are all of considerable age. Although these structures are included among superficial structures (II.2) for the purposes of this catalogue, they may be better classified under type II.3 monuments (cubic tombs). Positive identification, however, is still pending. Indications that the <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma ṇi</span> walls of gnyer ma gyam mon rdo, may in some cases, be modified cubic tombs include:</p> <ol type=\"1\"> <li>Their persistent attribution among local sources to the ancient <span class=\"popular\">Mön</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span>. </li> <li>The resemblance of two of the structures to mountaintop cubic tombs.</li> <li>Their location on the top of lofty rock outcrops.</li> </ol> <p>Indeed, there seems to be little cause for building <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma ṇi</span> walls on ridgelines without compelling circumstances. It may be that they were designed to subdue or recast archaic monuments in a Buddhist light. It must be remembered that the site is within the ambit of the <span class=\"popular\">Gangri Tso Sum</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gangs ri mtsho gsum</span>, a region of exceptional importance to Tibetan Buddhism. This strong Buddhist territorial association may have acted as the motivation for the rebuilding of earlier remains.

This structure (1.6 m x 1.6 m x 1.2 m) is built in the fashion of tombs with random-rubble walls composed of thin blocks. Plaques inscribed with the <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma ṇi</span> mantra have been laid on top of the structure. From this point on the ridge there are long views to the east. On the same outcrop, directly below this structure, there are three other walls with <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma ṇi</span> plaques: two small round walls and a small quadrate platform. On a lower outcrop there is another <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma ṇi</span> wall. On the lowest outcrop of the site there is another <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma ṇi</span> wall that somewhat resembles a cubic tomb (39.776΄ / 12.149΄ / 5010m). </p>  "}]}
