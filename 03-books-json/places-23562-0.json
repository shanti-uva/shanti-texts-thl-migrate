According to this legend, Brag dben was a\n                        branch monastery of gShen Dar sding in gTsang. gShen rGyal ba &rsquo;od zer, a\n                        disciple of Kun mkhyen Ye shes blo gros, travelled to sBas gnas in Nyag rong\n                        in the 3rd Rab byung (1192-1251), where he gave teachings based on the cycls\n                        of Ma rgyud, Khro bo, Phur pa and the Zhang zhung snyan brgyud in accordance\n                        with the gShen tshang tradition and it seems that sBas gnas became a\n                        hermitage from that time onwards.
