This four-sided grayish pillar (1.3 m [height] x 80 cm [basal girth]) stands next to the inner edge of the west wall. In the south section of the enclosure there is a not well centered highly weathered tan tabular pillar (1.2 m x 1 m) (Long-stone DR2). It was erected next to the inner edge of the west wall. There are two smaller gray pillars (Long-stones DR3, DR4) 60 cm in height, which were planted against the inner edge of the south wall, near the west end of the enclosure. There are also three broken pillars (Long-stones DR5, DR6, DR7) that were erected within the cobble courses of the south wall. Another broken pillar (Long-stone DR8) was raised inside the south wall near the east end of the enclosure. It appears that yet another small specimen was erected within the courses of the central bisecting wall of the enclosure. The erection of standing stones inside the wall courses is a highly unusual morphological feature of he <span class=\"popular\">Chunak<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Chu nag<\/span> site. By virtue of their presence among scores of superficial enclosures, the walled pillars must have fulfilled an extremely important funerary ritual role at <span class=\"popular\">Chunak<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Chu nag<\/span>. The location of the walled pillars at the eastern extremity of the site is also liable to have significant ritual and cognitive undertones. <\/p> "},{"title":"Tumulus","index":9,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p>Approximately 50 m west of the walled pillars there is large quadrate tumulus (<span class=\"popular emph\">bangso<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">bang so<\/span>) (09.796&#900; \/ 39.008&#900;). This tumulus is roughly aligned in the cardinal directions, and measures 17.8 m (north-south) x 15 m (east-west). This flat-topped structure varies between 2 m and 3 m in height. The surface of the mound is covered in loose cobbles; whatever coherent walls here were have completely disintegrated. On the top of the tumulus there are three cobble-filled depressions up o 1 m in depth. They appear to be the result of excavations carried out long ago. The looting of the contents is likely to be the only motive for such excavations in pre-modern times. <\/p> <p>On the east side of the tumulus, at its base, there is a large interconnected rectangular enclosure that measures 22 m (north-south) x 8 m (east-west). It is elevated about 50 cm above the surrounding plain. This enclosure is comprised of walls such as are found in other enclosures of <span class=\"popular\">Chunak<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Chu nag<\/span>. The appended enclosure appears to have been subdivided into three east-west sections: south (6 m wide north-south), central (8.5 m wide) and north 6.5 m (wide). The occurrence of enclosures at the base of a large <span class=\"popular emph\">bangso<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">bang so<\/span> is also met with at <span class=\"popular\">Darlung Gyangro<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Dar lung gyang ro<\/span> (D-88). These two umuli more or less circumscribe the eastern and western margins of the core Upper Tibetan paleocultural entity; hat region in which walled pillars (II.1b) and pillar arrays appended to edifices (II.1c) are distributed. The umulus of <span class=\"popular\">Chunak<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Chu nag<\/span> appears to have been a central monumental feature of the site. In sites where there is a large <span class=\"popular emph\">bangso<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">bang so<\/span> it often is found amid smaller and more superficial funerary structures. These large <span class=\"popular emph\">bangso<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">bang so<\/span> are probably the burial sites of very high status individuals and\/or where collective mortuary rites took place. In any case, it would appear that they constituted the ritual and monumental heart of many necropoli. <\/p> "},{"title":"Clusters of enclosures","index":10,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p>The superficial enclosures are mainly square and rectangular in form but there are also some sub-rectangular examples among them. They range between 3 m x 5 m to 15 m x 16 m in size. The perimeter walls (50 cm to 1 m hick) are composed of different colored (tan, red, gray, and beige) cobbles, which are between 10 cm and 35 cm in length. Many of the extant walls are generally aligned in the cardinal directions. The cobble perimeter walls are double-course or multiple-course in make-up. These walls are typically flush with the ground surface. There are also what appear to be heaped-stone walls 20 cm to 50 in height. In a few enclosures, these elevated wall sections reach 1 m in height. Rather than an inherent design feature, this piling of stones is probably due to he disintegration of neatly built walls, which were more than 1 vertical course in height. In all but a few cases, the area inside the perimeter walls of each enclosure is free of structural elements. There are also a few outlying structures of smaller proportions that are fully covered in stones embedded in the ground surface. The enclosures are interconnected to form clusters or networks of structures. The design and construction of hese enclosures most resembles those of <span class=\"popular\">Drak Tsangpo<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Brag gtsang po<\/span> (D-41), a site not too far away from <span class=\"popular\">Chunak<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Chu nag<\/span>. Many of the walls of the enclosures have been destroyed and many have depressions inside. These depressions are probably the result of excavations carried out long ago and possibly due to subsidence as well. <\/p> "},{"title":"Main cluster of enclosures","index":11,"parent_index":10,"body":null},{"title":"Upper cluster of enclosures","index":12,"parent_index":10,"body":" <p>To the west of the flat in which the main cluster of enclosures is located there is a bench about 30 m higher in elevation. On this bench is the upper cluster of enclosures (09.938&#900; \/ 38.708&#900;). The principal upper cluster measures 67 m (north-south) x 30 m (east-west), and contains about 20 enclosures of the kind found elsewhere at <span class=\"popular\">Chunak<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Chu nag<\/span>.
