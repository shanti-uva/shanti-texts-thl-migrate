The enclosure, located near the western extremity of the enclosed\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpillar typology territorial range, represents a unique variant of the monument.

This tumulus is roughly aligned in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcardinal directions, and measures 17.8 m (north-south) x 15 m (east-west).

The perimeter walls (50 cm to 1 m\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthick) are composed of different colored (tan, red, gray, and beige) cobbles, which are between 10 cm and 35 cm\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin length. Many of the extant walls are generally aligned in the cardinal directions. The cobble perimeter walls\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tare double-course or multiple-course in make-up. These walls are typically flush with the ground surface. There\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tare also what appear to be heaped-stone walls 20 cm to 50 in height. In a few enclosures, these elevated wall\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsections reach 1 m in height. Rather than an inherent design feature, this piling of stones is probably due to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe disintegration of neatly built walls, which were more than 1 vertical course in height. In all but a few\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcases, the area inside the perimeter walls of each enclosure is free of structural elements.
