The Tibetan word for Standard Tibetan is <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">\u0f66\u0fa4\u0fb1\u0f72\u0f0b\u0f66\u0f90\u0f51\u0f0b<\/span>, which literally means \u201ccommon language.\u201d Strictly speaking, instead of \u201cStandard Tibetan,\u201d it would be more accurate to describe this as \u201clanguage in the process of standardization.\u201d There is in fact neither a genuine academy of the Tibetan language, nor the political will to round off the process of standardization, which is nevertheless taking place naturally.<\/p><p class=\"Paragraph\">Standard Tibetan is a variety of the \u201cCentral Tibetan\u201d <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">\u0f51\u0f56\u0f74\u0f66\u0f0b\u0f66\u0f90\u0f51\u0f0b<\/span> spoken around Lhasa, and has become the lingua franca among Tibetans. It allows Tibetans living in other regions of Tibet (Amdo, Kham, Ngari, etc.), and indeed those residing in China, India, Nepal, Bhutan, Europe, and North America, to communicate with one another whatever their native dialect \u0f61\u0f74\u0f63\u0f0b\u0f66\u0f90\u0f51\u0f0b. Though Standard Tibetan is based on Central Tibetan, there are actually several varieties of Central Tibetan, reflecting the peculiarities and linguistic variations between different valleys, or even between different villages, in Central Tibet. However, these differences are minimal and do not hinder communication. In 1999, an important book called <em>Collective Work on the Common Tibetan Language<\/em><a name=\"n1\" href=\"#fn1\"><em><strong>[1]<\/strong><\/em><\/a> was published in Beijing, with the participation of many prominent scholars from all the regions of Tibet. This is the first major recognition of Standard Tibetan based on Lhasa dialect.<\/p><p class=\"Paragraph\">It should be noted that some intellectuals from Amdo and even from Kham are reluctant to learn the current \u201cStandard Tibetan,\u201d based on Central Tibetan. They would prefer a common language not entirely derived from the latter. Unfortunately such a language does not exist. When Amdowas or Khampas meet natives of Tsang or Central Tibet they have no other option, if they don\u2019t know \u201cStandard Spoken Tibetan,\u201d but to converse in Chinese or English (depending on the country in which they find themselves), or indeed to write in Literary Tibetan, which is common to all Tibet but is not a spoken language. At Tibetology conferences throughout the world (in China, Europe, India, and the United States), speakers normally use Standard Tibetan whatever their dialect of origin.<\/p><p class=\"Paragraph\">The general term <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">\u0f56\u0f7c\u0f51\u0f0b\u0f66\u0f90\u0f51\u0f0b<\/span>, \u201cTibetan language,\u201d is also sometimes used to describe the lingua franca, although this usage has the disadvantage of being used also to describe the other dialects.
