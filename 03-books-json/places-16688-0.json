At what was the southwest corner of the enclosure a single stone is in place. This stone is 4.5 m from the opposite\/northwest corner of the enclosure, delineating the probable width of the enclosure. The enclosure does not appear to have been well aligned in the cardinal directions. <\/p> "},{"title":"Pillars","index":8,"parent_index":6,"body":null}]}
