The New Schools (gsar ma) of Tibetan Buddhism employ the classification of four tantric classes (rgyud sde bzhi) – known as the \"new tantras\" (gsar rgyud) since they stem from the second transmission of Buddhism to Tibet (c. 1000 CE onwards). In nine vehicle systems, the tantras (particularly vehicles seven through nine) are known as the \"old tantras\" (rnying rgyud) since their supposed translation into Tibetan stems from the first transmission of Buddhism into Tibet (750-950 CE). While the new tantras on the whole are clearly translations from Indic languages, the provenance of the old tantras is controversial. Although these tantras purport to be translations from Indic languages (especially from the Northwest of India in Oḍḍiyāna), many believe they had their origins in Tibetan regions and other areas of the Himalayas during this time period, and might represent a complex mixture of the codification of oral traditions stemming from outside Tibet, literary products of non-Tibetan visionaries/scholars generated while they were traveling in Tibet, independent Tibetan compositions/revelations, and so on.</p>","title":"An Overview of the Nine Vehicles of Nyingma"}]}
