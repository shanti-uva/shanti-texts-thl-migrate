It is located on the east bank of the ’Bri chu river (the Yangtze, Chinese Jing sha jiang) in the northwestern part of the prefecture. The county is divided into seven Qu comprising twenty-six Xiang, and one hundred and seventeen administrative villages. Gonchen (dGon chen), the capital of the county is located at latitude 31°48’N, and longitude 98°34’E, at an altitude of 3,240m. The county is particularly famous for its printing house known as Par khang chos mdzod chen mo bkra shis sgo mang. It is the largest traditional printing place in the Tibetan cultural area in Sichuan. The Par khang is renowned for its editions of the Buddhist ’Ka’ ’gyur and bsTan ’gyur and certain texts of the Sa skya, dGe lugs, bKa’ brgyud, rNying ma and Bon traditions, as well as its printing blocks of images for reproducing thangkas. The printing house was founded by bsTan pa tshe ring, the fortieth King of Derge, in 1729 within the complex of Derge Gonchen Monastery, located in the county town. Another famous site in the county is the temple Ge sar lha khang. Tibetans believe that Ge sar was born to the Gling tshang family in Derge, and most of the epic’s episodes take place in the Derge region. Thus a temple dedicated to King Ge sar was built in the county in A phyug pasture which is believed to be the hero’s birth place. The temple contains statues of Ge sar and the Thirty Generals. Many of the place names in the epic correspond to existing places in the area. The temple is located 208 km northeast of the county town. There are ten Bonpo, fourteen rNying ma pa, nine bKa’ brgyud pa, one mixed rNying ma pa and bKa’ brgyud pa, nineteen Sa skya pa, and five dGe lugs pa monasteries in Derge county at present.</p> "},{"title":"(135) Khro tshang Monastery","index":3,"parent_index":2,"body":" "},{"title":"1.

They attracted a number of disciples, including the Nine Saints of Khrom rdzong (Khrom rdzong rtogs dgu), the most famous of whom was Shes rab phun tshogs; their monastic establishment thus became known by the name of Khrom rdzong Phun tshogs gling.</p> <p>In the middle of the 1st Rab byung (1027-1097), rMe’u ston bSod nams came to the monastery and began to teach Bonpo tantric practice and the monastery’s name was changed to bKra shis phun tshogs gling. Thereafter, the Khro tshang lineage became the principal lineage of the monastery and the monastery was renamed Khro tshang Dar rgyas gling. It is not clear who the first master was and when precisely the lineage originated, but according to one account, the first master was Khro tshang Mar legs. According to the same account, there were three brothers in the Khro tshang lineage, Mar legs, Byang pa Nyi ma rgyal mtshan and Mu la snying po. Khro tshang Mar legs went to Zal mo sgang and became the master of the monasteries situated in Shar rdza’i lding khrom. They are: Khro tshang, sMon rgyal, ’Bum rmad, Shar rdza Ri khrod, sTeng chen, Zer ’phro and ’Phen zhol. His two brothers went to The bong and Rong khams. rTogs ldan Ye shes bstan ’dzin (1772-?) of Khro tshang Monastery became the monastery’s first abbot (mkhan po) and established the observance of the summer fast (dbyar gnas). His successors were mChog sprul Khro bo rgyal mtshan, mKhan chen lHun grub ye shes, rTogs ldan bSam gtan ye shes, Dam ldan Shes rab seng ge (rTogs ldan chung ba, the “Younger Saint”), Nyams rtogs Tshad ’phel dga’ bde, Grub brnyes Tshe dbang ’od zer, ’Gro ’dren A dkar, rGyud ’dzin rNam mkhyen rang grol, Yongs ’dzin ’Brug gsas chems pa (?-1991). </p> <p>All the Kun grol Trulku from Kun grol ’Ja’ tshon snying po (b.1700) to Kun grol Hum chen were in charge of the monastery. gSang sngags gling pa from Nyag rong and Shar rdza bKra shis rgyal mtshan also taught and practised at the monastery for a number of years.</p> "},{"title":"4.

According to mThu stobs rnma rgyal, who is the present <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">rgyal tshab</span> of Shar rdza bKra shis rgyal mtshan and master of ’Bum rmad Monastery, first there was a monastery on the south bank of rDza chu river. As it was located close to a rock called rGya rdzong brag, the monastery was named rGya rdzong Monastery. bSod nams dbang grags appointed dBra bla Nam mkha’ blo gros as his successor. Under Kun grol ’Ja’ tshon snying po (b.1700), after the succession of the monastery’s eleventh abbot (after the accession of Kun grol ’Ja’ tshon snying po (b.1700), the eleventh abbot), the monastery was moved to the north bank of the river, where its local lay communinty lived, and the name of the monstery was changed to ’Bum rmad. As far as we know he was succeeded by gYung drung rnam rgyal, born in rDza yul, and was then recognized as the reincarnation of his predecessor? gYung drung rnam rgyal’s incarnation seems to have been dBon sprul bsTan pa rgyal mtshan who was recognized by dGe bshes gSang sngags grags pa. The following reincarnation was Ye shes bstan ’dzin, recognized by gTer chen bDe gling pa. Ye shes bstan ’dzin was succeeded by Mi pham rnam rgyal. His successor was dGe sprul Yid bzhin legs grub (d.1952), recognized by Kun grol bDud ’dul gling pa. The reincarnation of dGe sprul Yid bzhin legs grub was ’Chi med zla ba yid bzhin rgya mtsho (b.1978, also known as ’Chi med zla ba ye shes), recognized by Tshul chen Trulku of rTogs ldan Monastery in rNga khog. The last abbot of the monastery, mThu stobs rnam rgyal was born in 1926. He became a monk in ’Bum rmad Monastery at the age of eight. The following year, Shar rdza bKra shis rgyal mtshan, sensing that his life and hence his contribution to the Bon religion were coming to an end, decided to perform the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">Phyi rgyud cho ga bcu gnyis</span> empowerment ceremony, which was to be his last. mThu stobs rnam rgyal participated in the empowerment ceremony. Shortly after Shar rdza bKra shis rgyal mtshan ‘passed away into his rainbow body’. mThu stobs rnam rgyal studied under Blo gros rgya mtsho, the apostle (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">rgyal tshab</span>) of Shar rdza bKra shis rgyal mtshan, Gling zhig Tshe dbang g-yung drung and various other masters. At the age of thirteen, he became a disciple of Kun grol hum chen and studied with him for nine years. At the age of twenty-two, he went to central Tibet on a pilgrimage to Bon ri, Yar lung, rGyal rtse, bKra shis lhun po, Zhu tshang, Sa skya, gShen Dar sding, mKhar sna, sMan ri, gYung drung gling, Se ra, ’Bras spungs, dGa’ ldan and a number of other sacred sites.

In the meantime Shar rdza bKra shis rgyalmtshan’s influence, owing to his scholarly and spiritual accomplishments and miraculous death, has been steadily growing, and, moreover, Shar rdza Hermitage is much closer than sMan ri or gYung drung gling for the Bonpo monks of Amdo and Khams. Thus, at present most Bonpo monasteries in Amdo and Khams send their monks to Shar rdza Hermitage instead of sMan ri or gYung drung gling. The number of monks at the hermitage varies and there is a constant turn over. In the last fifteen years, Derge county government founded several religous schools for monks of all different religious traditions and Shar rdza Hermitage was included among the schools for Bonpo teachings and thus may officially accept monks, but the educational system remains traditional and it is still mainly a retreat center.</p> "},{"title":"8 / 9.

At first, the family of rMe’u, who was based in gTsang, was in charge of the monastery, but unfortunately the history of this lineage remains obscure. However, later dBra ston lHa yi blo gros (his dates are not known, but he is believed to have been a contemporary of ’Gro mgon ’Phags pa, 1235-1280) from dBra dgon Monastery in dKar mdzes came to sTeng chen where he later settled and hence started a rMe’u lineage. It is said that dBra ston founded twenty monasteries in dBus gtsang, Khams and Amdo. He extended sTeng chen Monastery by building the gTsug lag khang and also enlarged the temple. His successor was dBra pa ’Dul ba rgyal mtshan who received his ordination from mNyam med Shes rab rgyal mtshan, founder of sMan ri Monastery. dBra pa ’Dul ba rgyal mtshan first went to gYas ru dBen sa kha Monastery in gTsang. He is referred to as ’Gro mgon dBra ston chen mo and is said to be one of the Eighteen Masters (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">ston pa bco brgyad</span>) of gYas ru dben sa Monastery. He was succeeded in turn by dBra pa Tshul khrims rgyal mtshan who studied the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">A khrid</span>, <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">rDzogs chen</span> and <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">sNyan rgyud</span> traditions under rMe’u mKhas pa dPal chen. The period from Tshul khrims rgyal mtshan’s time to that of dBra ba sKal bzang nyi ma remains obscure. dBra ba sKal bzang nyi ma was born in the Iron-Hare Year in the 15th Rab byung (1891). During his time, in 1902, sTeng chen Monastery was burned down by the monks of the nearby dGe lugs pa monastery of dGon gsar, because the dGon gsar monks believed that the assembly hall of sTeng chen prevented the sunlight from reaching their monastery (i.e. the monks of dGon gsar Monastery were jealous of the height and grandeur of sTeng chen Monastery). I am sure there are two sides to this story but unfortunately I could not find any Sources containing dGon gsar Monastery’s version of the events. In any case the monastery was burned down by the dGon gsar monks and more than twenty buildings and all the statues and texts within were completely destroyed. sKal bzang nyi ma fled to Hor in the Nag chu kha region, and the elder monks to gSer thar pasture. </p> <p>In 1905, sTeng chen Monastery sent a group of representatives from sTeng chen and other monasteries, accompanied by two lDing dpon officers from Nyag rong to Lhasa to request permission to rebuild the monastery. gNas brtan gYung drung bstan pa, the representative of sTeng chen Monastery, related the events to the sPyi khyab mKhan po of the bKa’ shag in Lhasa (the highest monk official in the Dalai Lama’s government), who reported the story to the 13th Dalai Lama. The Dalai Lama granted the monastery permission to rebuild and the sPyi khyab mkhan po sent a government representative together with A rta, one of the lDing dpon officers of Nyag rong, to rDza khog to act as mediators between the two monasteries. 1908 marked the beginning of the monastery’s reconstruction. The work was supervised by dBra spyul sKal bzang nyi ma and dBra dpon rNam rgyal grags pa, the local chief. Shar rdza bKra shis rgyal mtshan and dBra sras Zla ba grags pa also largely contributed to the reconstruction and revival of the monastery. In 1916, the work was completed and the monastery was renamed dPal gShen bstan mdo sngags g-yung drung bstan rgyas gling. Shar rdza bKra shis rgyal mtshan was responsible for the iconographic programme of its interior decoration. Many famous Bonpo masters visited the monastery, including Khro tshang ’Brug lha, gSer chen Sangs rgyas gling pa, Kun grol ’ja’ tshon snying po, mKhan chen Nyi ma bstan ’dzin, and the “three lineages of dBra, lCang and sMon”, (dBra lCang sMon gsum):</p> <ol type=\"1\"> <li>the masters of the dBra lineage from sTeng chen Monastery </li> <li>the masters of the lCang lung lineage from lCang lung Monastery (No.158)</li> <li>the masters of the sMon rgyal lineage from sMon rgyal Monastery (No.136) </li> </ol> <p>sTeng chen Monastery was famous for a number of its practitioners who obtained the ‘rainbow-body’ (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">’ja’ lus</span>) at the time of their deaths.

Later the monastery was destroyed by a flood, which according to popular belief, was caused by the local deities who were offended by the monastery’s gold roof. Following this episode it was rebuilt by Nyag rong bKra shis dge legs, a disciple of Shar rdza bKra shis rgyal mtshan. It became a branch of sMon rgyal Monastery (No.136). In the 15th Rab byung (1867-1926), it became a branch of rDza sTeng chen Monastery and has remained as such until now. </p> <p>The monastery is headed by abbots. Since Shar rdza is a very isolated and poor area, it took several generations to complete the monastery’s reconstruction. Nyag rong bKra shis dge legs, who undertook the monastery’s reconstruction, built an assembly hall (’du khang), and two sanctuaries for the atonement (sgrub khang). The second abbot, Phun tshogs blo gros, made a large statue callled lHa chen, and painted the murals within the sgrub khang. The third abbot, Tshul khrims dar rgyas, built a kitchen and rebuilt another sgrub khang, and also introduced a system allowing the monastery to finance four monks at a time to do two-year tantric practice in the sgrub khang. The fourth abbot, Shes rab bstan ’dzin, travelled throughout Nyag rong and Khyung po to give teachings and collect funds for the monastery with which he built thirty small buildings for sheltering prayer-wheels (’khor chung), a small ma ti mantra wheel, and four large cauldrons (mtshogs zangs) and other cooking utensils for the monastery. The fifth abbot, rTogs ldan bsTan ’dzin blo gros, commissioned copper statues of the gNas brtan bcu drug (the “sixteen direct disciples of the Buddha”), Gu ru mtshan brgyad (the “eight aspects of Padmasambhava”), and gilded statues of the Buddhas of the Three Ages. The sixth abbot, rTogs ldan Zla ba rgyal mtshan, travelled to central Tibet whence he returned with the collected works of mNyam med Shes rab rgyal mtshan (1356-1415), two conches and three statues. The seventh abbot, dBang li, a disciple of Shar rdza bKra shis rgyal mtshan, repaired the assembly hall and built a wheel containing more than one hundred million ma ti mantras (stong ’khor). He is said to have passed away in his “rainbow body” (’ja’ lus). The eighth abbot, bsKal bzang bstan ’dzin, built a gold stupa (gser gdung mchod rten) and acquired more than forty volumes of tantric texts for the monastery. rTogs ldan Mi pham rnam rgyal and gYung drung nyi ma, commissioned statues of the thirty-five Buddhas (ltung gshags so lnga) and furnished the monastery with other religious relics. The tenth abbot, Nam mkha’ grags pa, acquired the complete works of Kun grol ’ja’ tshon snying po and gTer ston gSang sngags gling pa, and more than forty thangkhas for the monastery. Shes rab phun tshogs and Nam mkha’ ye shes, established a philosophical college (bshad gwra). The twelfth abbot, Tshul khrims dbang rgyal, founded a printing house containing more than a thousand printing blocks. As a very rare exception, there were dKon mchog, dBang ldan, mThar phyin and rGyal mchog: dKon mchog was a very learned master and introduced a ritual of bDe ’dus sgrub mchod which the monastery performs on the 15th day of the 5th month; dBang ldan was also mgon khang bla ma. mThar phyin was the head of the bshad grwa at the same time; rGyal mchog was a gCod pa, one who practices mainly gCod.

The monks in Ri spun Monastery indicated that their monastery was associated with rDzong gsar, a Sa skya pa monastery in the same county, and that I would probably find some information concerning Ri spun in the historical records of rDzong gsar Monastery. I found only one account of rDzong gsar’s history, entitled rDzong gsar dgon gyi lo gyus (MS, anonymous), but the name of Ri spun is not even mentioned there. Yet several people, including Buddhists and government officials, also confirmed the connection between Ri spun and rDzong gsar. Indeed the monasteries maintain very close ties and rDzong gsar, being the wealthier of the two, even supports Ri spun Monastery. However, rDzong gsar does not acknowledge its Bon related origin, not even in its historical records. The local inhabitants say that there is a stone tablet with an inscription concerning the history of Ri spun and rDzong gsar in the place from lHa tshe dbang of dPal spungs thang on the shore of gSer ngu g.yu mtsho lake with an inscription concerning the history of Ri spun and rDzong gsar, but Blo gros phun tshogs, the author of Ri spun dgon gyi lo rgyus, says that he could not find it. There are ruins of an ancient castle at the top of a hill near the monastery called Khyung po rdzong, and there are several rather vague legends concerning its history, but no one seems to know anything precise about it. According to oral tradition, the monastery was founded in a Fire-Hare Year, but in which Rab byung remains unknown. It is said that several famous masters, such as Shar pa rNal ’byor, Khyung po Blo gros rgyal mtshan, Bu ’bor Tog gi rgyal mtshan, Du tshe rTogs ldan and Ri bla Ye shes stayed at the monastery. In the latter half of Ri bla Ye shes’s life, the monastery was destroyed in a local conflict and that it was rebuilt by Ri bla Dar rgyas. Unfortunately, the dates of the masters mentioned above remain unknown.
