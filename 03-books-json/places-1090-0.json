It is located on the east bank of the\n                  &rsquo;Bri chu river (the Yangtze, Chinese Jing sha jiang) in the northwestern part of\n                  the prefecture. The county is divided into seven Qu comprising twenty-six Xiang,\n                  and one hundred and seventeen administrative villages. Gonchen (dGon chen), the\n                  capital of the county is located at latitude 31&deg;48&rsquo;N, and longitude 98&deg;34&rsquo;E, at an\n                  altitude of 3,240m. The county is particularly famous for its printing house known\n                  as Par khang chos mdzod chen mo bkra shis sgo mang. It is the largest traditional\n                  printing place in the Tibetan cultural area in Sichuan. The Par khang is renowned\n                  for its editions of the Buddhist &rsquo;Ka&rsquo; &rsquo;gyur and bsTan &rsquo;gyur and certain texts of\n                  the Sa skya, dGe lugs, bKa&rsquo; brgyud, rNying ma and Bon traditions, as well as its\n                  printing blocks of images for reproducing thangkas. The printing house was founded\n                  by bsTan pa tshe ring, the fortieth King of Derge, in 1729 within the complex of\n                  Derge Gonchen Monastery, located in the county town. Another famous site in the\n                  county is the temple Ge sar lha khang. Tibetans believe that Ge sar was born to\n                  the Gling tshang family in Derge, and most of the epic&rsquo;s episodes take place in\n                  the Derge region. Thus a temple dedicated to King Ge sar was built in the county\n                  in A phyug pasture which is believed to be the hero&rsquo;s birth place. The temple\n                  contains statues of Ge sar and the Thirty Generals. Many of the place names in the\n                  epic correspond to existing places in the area. The temple is located 208 km\n                  northeast of the county town. There are ten Bonpo, fourteen rNying ma pa, nine\n                  bKa&rsquo; brgyud pa, one mixed rNying ma pa and bKa&rsquo; brgyud pa, nineteen Sa skya pa,\n                  and five dGe lugs pa monasteries in Derge county at present.</p>\n\n               \n\n                  "},{"title":"(135) Khro tshang Monastery","index":3,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n\n                  \n\n                     "},{"title":"1.

It is not clear who the first master\n                        was and when precisely the lineage originated, but according to one account,\n                        the first master was Khro tshang Mar legs. According to the same account,\n                        there were three brothers in the Khro tshang lineage, Mar legs, Byang pa Nyi\n                        ma rgyal mtshan and Mu la snying po. Khro tshang Mar legs went to Zal mo\n                        sgang and became the master of the monasteries situated in Shar rdza&rsquo;i lding\n                        khrom.

At the age of thirteen, he became a\n                        disciple of Kun grol hum chen and studied with him for nine years.

However, later dBra ston lHa yi blo gros (his dates are not known,\n                        but he is believed to have been a contemporary of &rsquo;Gro mgon &rsquo;Phags pa,\n                        1235-1280) from dBra dgon Monastery in dKar mdzes came to sTeng chen where\n                        he later settled and hence started a rMe&rsquo;u lineage. It is said that dBra\n                        ston founded twenty monasteries in dBus gtsang, Khams and Amdo. He extended\n                        sTeng chen Monastery by building the gTsug lag khang and also enlarged the\n                        temple. His successor was dBra pa &rsquo;Dul ba rgyal mtshan who received his\n                        ordination from mNyam med Shes rab rgyal mtshan, founder of sMan ri\n                        Monastery. dBra pa &rsquo;Dul ba rgyal mtshan first went to gYas ru dBen sa kha\n                        Monastery in gTsang.

During his time, in 1902, sTeng chen Monastery\n                        was burned down by the monks of the nearby dGe lugs pa monastery of dGon\n                        gsar, because the dGon gsar monks believed that the assembly hall of sTeng\n                        chen prevented the sunlight from reaching their monastery (i.e. the monks of\n                        dGon gsar Monastery were jealous of the height and grandeur of sTeng chen\n                        Monastery). I am sure there are two sides to this story but unfortunately I\n                        could not find any Sources containing dGon gsar Monastery&rsquo;s version of the\n                        events. In any case the monastery was burned down by the dGon gsar monks and\n                        more than twenty buildings and all the statues and texts within were\n                        completely destroyed. sKal bzang nyi ma fled to Hor in the Nag chu kha\n                        region, and the elder monks to gSer thar pasture. </p>\n\n                     <p>In 1905, sTeng chen Monastery sent a group of representatives from sTeng\n                        chen and other monasteries, accompanied by two lDing dpon officers from Nyag\n                        rong to Lhasa to request permission to rebuild the monastery. gNas brtan\n                        gYung drung bstan pa, the representative of sTeng chen Monastery, related\n                        the events to the sPyi khyab mKhan po of the bKa&rsquo; shag in Lhasa (the highest\n                        monk official in the Dalai Lama&rsquo;s government), who reported the story to the\n                        13th Dalai Lama. The Dalai Lama granted the monastery permission to rebuild\n                        and the sPyi khyab mkhan po sent a government representative together with A\n                        rta, one of the lDing dpon officers of Nyag rong, to rDza khog to act as\n                        mediators between the two monasteries. 1908 marked the beginning of the\n                        monastery&rsquo;s reconstruction. The work was supervised by dBra spyul sKal bzang\n                        nyi ma and dBra dpon rNam rgyal grags pa, the local chief. Shar rdza bKra\n                        shis rgyal mtshan and dBra sras Zla ba grags pa also largely contributed to\n                        the reconstruction and revival of the monastery. In 1916, the work was\n                        completed and the monastery was renamed dPal gShen bstan mdo sngags g-yung\n                        drung bstan rgyas gling. Shar rdza bKra shis rgyal mtshan was responsible\n                        for the iconographic programme of its interior decoration.

History","index":90,"parent_index":87,"body":"\n\n                     <p>According to oral tradition, the monastery was founded by gYung drung rnam\n                        rgyal with the financial support of Gling tshang, one of the leading\n                        families in Derge, around eight hundreds years ago. Later the monastery was\n                        destroyed by a flood, which according to popular belief, was caused by the\n                        local deities who were offended by the monastery&rsquo;s gold roof. Following this\n                        episode it was rebuilt by Nyag rong bKra shis dge legs, a disciple of Shar\n                        rdza bKra shis rgyal mtshan. It became a branch of sMon rgyal Monastery\n                        (No.136). In the 15th Rab byung (1867-1926), it became a branch of rDza\n                        sTeng chen Monastery and has remained as such until now. </p>\n\n                     <p>The monastery is headed by abbots. Since Shar rdza is a very isolated and\n                        poor area, it took several generations to complete the monastery&rsquo;s\n                        reconstruction. Nyag rong bKra shis dge legs, who undertook the monastery&rsquo;s\n                        reconstruction, built an assembly hall (&rsquo;du khang), and two sanctuaries for\n                        the atonement (sgrub khang). The second abbot, Phun tshogs blo gros, made a\n                        large statue callled lHa chen, and painted the murals within the sgrub\n                        khang. The third abbot, Tshul khrims dar rgyas, built a kitchen and rebuilt\n                        another sgrub khang, and also introduced a system allowing the monastery to\n                        finance four monks at a time to do two-year tantric practice in the sgrub\n                        khang. The fourth abbot, Shes rab bstan &rsquo;dzin, travelled throughout Nyag\n                        rong and Khyung po to give teachings and collect funds for the monastery\n                        with which he built thirty small buildings for sheltering prayer-wheels\n                        (&rsquo;khor chung), a small ma ti mantra wheel, and four large cauldrons (mtshogs\n                        zangs) and other cooking utensils for the monastery. The fifth abbot, rTogs\n                        ldan bsTan &rsquo;dzin blo gros, commissioned copper statues of the gNas brtan bcu\n                        drug (the &ldquo;sixteen direct disciples of the Buddha&rdquo;), Gu ru mtshan brgyad\n                        (the &ldquo;eight aspects of Padmasambhava&rdquo;), and gilded statues of the Buddhas of\n                        the Three Ages. The sixth abbot, rTogs ldan Zla ba rgyal mtshan, travelled\n                        to central Tibet whence he returned with the collected works of mNyam med\n                        Shes rab rgyal mtshan (1356-1415), two conches and three statues. The\n                        seventh abbot, dBang li, a disciple of Shar rdza bKra shis rgyal mtshan,\n                        repaired the assembly hall and built a wheel containing more than one\n                        hundred million ma ti mantras (stong &rsquo;khor). He is said to have passed away\n                        in his &ldquo;rainbow body&rdquo; (&rsquo;ja&rsquo; lus). The eighth abbot, bsKal bzang bstan &rsquo;dzin,\n                        built a gold stupa (gser gdung mchod rten) and acquired more than forty\n                        volumes of tantric texts for the monastery. rTogs ldan Mi pham rnam rgyal\n                        and gYung drung nyi ma, commissioned statues of the thirty-five Buddhas\n                        (ltung gshags so lnga) and furnished the monastery with other religious\n                        relics. The tenth abbot, Nam mkha&rsquo; grags pa, acquired the complete works of\n                        Kun grol &rsquo;ja&rsquo; tshon snying po and gTer ston gSang sngags gling pa, and more\n                        than forty thangkhas for the monastery. Shes rab phun tshogs and Nam mkha&rsquo;\n                        ye shes, established a philosophical college (bshad gwra). The twelfth\n                        abbot, Tshul khrims dbang rgyal, founded a printing house containing more\n                        than a thousand printing blocks. As a very rare exception, there were dKon\n                        mchog, dBang ldan, mThar phyin and rGyal mchog: dKon mchog was a very\n                        learned master and introduced a ritual of bDe &rsquo;dus sgrub mchod which the\n                        monastery performs on the 15th day of the 5th month; dBang ldan was also\n                        mgon khang bla ma. mThar phyin was the head of the bshad grwa at the same\n                        time; rGyal mchog was a gCod pa, one who practices mainly gCod. There were\n                        three fourteenth abbots bsTan pa dkon mchog, Tshe ring dpal bzang and Nyi ma\n                        grags pa, until the mid-20th century. </p>\n\n                     <p>The monastery suffered from destruction in the 1980s, it was rebuilt by bSod\n                        nams blo gros, dBra sras bSod nams lha rgyal and dBra sras Yid bzhin dbang\n                        rgyal, the last three abbots of the monastery. </p>\n\n                     <p>The above information was provided by the Zer &rsquo;phro dgon pa&rsquo;i lo rgyus by\n                        rDza pa Tshe ring &rsquo;gyur med which unfortunately does not give dates or\n                        details of the abbots&rsquo; life stories.</p>\n\n                  \n\n                  \n\n                     "},{"title":"4.
