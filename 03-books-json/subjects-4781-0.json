   "body": "<p class=\"Paragraph\">This copula indicates a past or present testimony on the speaker’s part and implies that the speaker is or has been a direct witness to whatever he or she is asserting. In English, it is translated by the same expressions as for <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ཡོད་རེད་</span>, i.e., according to context as “to be at” (situative sense), “to be” (existential sense), “to have” (possessive sense), or by the verb “to be” (attributive sense). The latter applies only when the verb is preceded by a qualifying adjective. Thus the only difference between <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">འདུག་ </span>and <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ཡོད་རེད་ </span>lies in the different evidential moods they express (these moods have been described above). The translation of the following phrases would therefore be exactly the same as those given above:</p>
<ul> <li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">བོད་ལ་གནམ་གྲུ་འདུག</span> “There are airplanes in Tibet.” </li> <li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ཐུབ་བསྟན་ལགས་འདའི་</span>(<span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">འདིར་</span>)<span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">འདུག</span> “Tupten is here.”</li> <li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ཁོང་ལ་དེབ་མང་པོ་འདུག </span>“He has many books.”</li> <li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">འདི་སྙིང་རྗེ་པོ་འདུག</span> “This is pretty.”</li> <li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">འདི་གསལ་པོ་འདུག </span>“This is clear.”</li> <li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">འདི་ཚ་པོ་འདུག</span> “This is hot.”</li> </ul>
<p class=\"Paragraph\">However, exactly as in the case of the assertive copula, it is impossible to say:</p>
<ul> <li>· *<span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ཁོང་རྒྱ་མི་མི་འདུག</span> “He is Chinese.” </li> </ul>
