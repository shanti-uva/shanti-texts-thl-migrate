There are an unequal number of stones in each of the rows totaling 110. Most of the miniature pillars extend merely 10 cm to 20 cm above the ground surface. The tallest among them is 40 cm. In the most northerly row there are several tabular specimens, otherwise, the standing stones are pointed and have an irregular form. The rows of pillars are spaced 35 cm to 45 cm apart from one another. Each stone in a row is ypically spaced 15 cm to 20 cm from the next one. Some of the southern rows appear to be missing stones in the east portion of the array (these rows are shortened). Despite this upwards of 70 percent of all standing stones erected at the site seem to still be in situ. It is possible, however, that the array was originally more extensive than the in situ evidence now indicates. <\/p>  "}]}
