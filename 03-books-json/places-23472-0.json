The long distance makes it difficult to reach the monastery.</p>\n\n                     <p>The monastery was founded in 1697. Before 1959, there was a lama and\n                        eighty-three monks and at present there are thirty. In spite of its long\n                        history, it has seen little growth due to the rise and fall of Bonpo\n                        fortunes. There is only a temple, an assembly hall and a meditation hall,\n                        all very small. Religious objects in its possession include twenty statues,\n                        large and small, including those of gShen lha &rsquo;od dkar, Dran pa nam mkha&rsquo;\n                        and Yum chen Byams ma, and six thangka. The monastery depends upon ten yaks\n                        and a small number of horses and mules for income. The monks must make their\n                        living, as in other Bonpo monasteries, by obtaining support from households\n                        and by going out to perform religious services in villages.</p>\n\n                  "}]}
