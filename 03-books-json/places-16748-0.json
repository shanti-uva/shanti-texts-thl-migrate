Parts of all four double-course walls (50 cm to 80 cm thick) are extant. These walls are composed of uncut pieces of gray limestone, 10 cm to 50 cm in length. These stones were laid flat and inserted edgewise into the ground, and are generally level with the surface or project above it to a maximum height of 20 cm. The west/lower side of the enclosure is somewhat elevated in order to compensate for he slope gradient.

These highly eroded, beige to brownish standing stones have a white grain, a well developed patina and orange climax lichen growing on them.
