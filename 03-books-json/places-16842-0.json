These structures appear to have a funerary identity and are found on sandy and rock benches.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThey are primarily constructed from a light-colored, hard, fine-grained rock of variable length (10 cm to 80 cm\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlong). The structures are in a very poor state of preservation, precluding a close assessment of their design\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcharacteristics. It appears that these structures had heaped-stone walls. Double-course perimeter walls may also\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbe represented among them. It is quite possible that other structures were overlooked in the rocky terrain during\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe survey. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>There is also an archaic residential settlement consisting of all-stone corbelled edifices on <span class=\"popular\">Tsodo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mtsho do</span> (B-131), which is located just over 2 km from the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfunerary structures.

This is not the case on the smaller Upper Tibetan islands with archaic cultural sites.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPerhaps a certain minimum physical distance between residential installations and burial grounds was considered\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdesirable by the ancient inhabitants of the islands. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>According to local sources, <span class=\"popular\">Tsodo M&ouml;ndur</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mtsho do mon dur</span> is associated with the ancient <span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span>. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Site elements","index":6,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Funerary Structure FS1","index":7,"parent_index":6,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Funerary structure FS1 (3.4 m x 5 m) is an irregularly shaped enclosure with unordered perimeter walls (31&deg;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t29.82&#900; N. lat. / 83&deg; 14.03&#900; E. long.).
