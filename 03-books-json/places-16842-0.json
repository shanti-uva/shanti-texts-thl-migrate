   "body": "<p> <span class=\"popular\">Tsodo Möndur</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mtsho do mon dur</span> is located on the southeast side of <span class=\"popular\">Tsodo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mtsho do</span>, the largest island of Upper Tibet. This 12-km long island rises out of the great salt lake,<span class=\"popular\">Ngangla Ringtso</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ngang la ring mtsho</span>. <span class=\"popular\">Tsodo Möndur</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mtsho do mon dur</span> is situated in a locale known as <span class=\"popular\">Kochung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ko chung</span> (sp.?). It has open views across the <span class=\"popular\">Ngangla Ringtso</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ngang la ring mtsho</span> basin to the east. Five enclosures were detected at <span class=\"popular\">Tsodo Möndur</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mtsho do mon dur</span>. These structures appear to have a funerary identity and are found on sandy and rock benches. They are primarily constructed from a light-colored, hard, fine-grained rock of variable length (10 cm to 80 cm long). The structures are in a very poor state of preservation, precluding a close assessment of their design characteristics. It appears that these structures had heaped-stone walls. Double-course perimeter walls may also be represented among them. It is quite possible that other structures were overlooked in the rocky terrain during he survey. </p><p>There is also an archaic residential settlement consisting of all-stone corbelled edifices on <span class=\"popular\">Tsodo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mtsho do</span> (B-131), which is located just over 2 km from the funerary structures. These two sites may be interrelated, as the twin burial and residential components of ancient settlement on the island. <span class=\"popular\">Semodo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Se mo do</span> (D-127) and <span class=\"popular\">Tsodo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mtsho do</span>, two large islands, both appear to support funerary sites. This is not the case on the smaller Upper Tibetan islands with archaic cultural sites. Perhaps a certain minimum physical distance between residential installations and burial grounds was considered desirable by the ancient inhabitants of the islands. </p>",
