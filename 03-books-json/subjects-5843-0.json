One visualizes one’s consciousness as a luminous sphere or syllable moving up and down the central channel of one’s subtle body in conjunction with respiration and the enunciation of the mantric syllables hrik and pheṭ. Often the Buddha Immeasurable Light (‘od dpag med [Öpakme]; Skt., Amitābha), who presides over the most popular Pure Land of choice, is visualized blocking off the top of one’s skull. This practice is usually done during specialized retreats (often large lay gatherings) in which practitioners aim to create a small hole in their scalp where the consciousness is being targeted. In addition to enabling a practitioner to instinctively shoot his or her consciousness into a Pure Land in the case of accidental death, the same technique can be deployed in funerary ceremonies by the presiding lama to forcibly shoot the deceased person’s consciousness out of the body into a Pure Land by force of his or her own visualization. The “intermediate process” (bar do) is the famous Tibetan religious conception of life, death, and rebirth as a never-ending series of transitions, including a period of tumultuous visions experienced between death and rebirth.
