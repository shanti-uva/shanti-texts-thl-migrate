The massive coursed-rubble walls that\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tencase the interior space are around 1.5 m in thickness.

Mostly small (around 20 cm long) light-colored cobbles and rounded stones were used to build\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe walls of the appended edifice. These walls also contain a few larger stones. In order to produce such\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmassive walls, stones were laid side by side in multiple courses. On the east side of the appended edifice\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthere are poorly preserved wall fragments running in an eastern direction.

As\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tso few pillars remain in the array, it is difficult to gauge its original size. At present, the array measures\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t35 m (north-south) x 33 m (east-west). In total, about 100 stones are left standing and roughly 200 are\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcollapsed and lie in the concourse. Originally the array may have numbered more than 1000 standing stones. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tarray itself is unevenly bisected into two parts by an east-west running double-course slab wall. The array of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpillars, in its present form, narrows in the direction of the appended edifice. The pillars are generally\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttabular in form and 2 cm to 5 cm thick. Their two broad sides are oriented north and south. The tallest pillar\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(1.2 m high) still anchored in the ground is inclined, and is located near the west end of the bisecting slab\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twall. The second tallest standing pillar is 60 cm in height, and about one dozen specimens reach 50 cm in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\theight. The largest uprooted pillar scattered about the array is 1.8 m in length. Around one dozen dislodged\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpillars are between 1 m and 1.2 m in length, while most prostrate specimens are 60 cm to 90 cm in length. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Beyond the current eastern extent of the array of pillars, there are at least 14 double-course slab walls\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trunning in parallel. This network of slab walls extends 35 m further east, but most of these structures are\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thighly fragmentary. Like the slab wall bisecting the array of pillars, these outlying slab walls consist of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvariable length (15 cm to 60 cm long) slabs of stone embedded in the ground edgewise. The average length of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe slabs is around 25 cm and they are 2 cm to 5 cm thick.
