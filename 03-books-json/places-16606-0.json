The long\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tedifice was built on a natural rise, 1.5 m to 2.5 m in height, which is accented by a gully that forms on its\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twest side. The walls are highly eroded but still regularly reach 2 m to 3 m in height. The edifice was built on\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ta cobble base (1 m to 1.2 m high) endowing it with a fairly high elevation. Parts of both the east and west\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsides of the structure have slipped down the slopes. So highly eroded are the adobe-block walls that their seams\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tare only visible in a couple of sheltered nooks. The north end of the building is around 7 m wide and may only\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thave supported a single room. The structure then widens to around 10 m. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"popular\">Manam Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ma nam mkhar</span> (West) is divided by a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlongitudinal wall (north-south), which runs from the north end of the edifice to within 14 m of its southern\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\textremity. On the west side of this dividing wall there is a row of at least nine rooms that progressively\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnarrow to the south. From north to south they begin at 2.5 m in width (east-west) narrowing to about 1.2 m,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconstituting what may have been no more than a passageway. These rooms are each 2 m to 3.5 m in length\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(north-south). The fragmentary nature of the walls and the loss of significant parts of the west side of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbuilding preclude a detailed assessment of its plan. East of the longitudinal wall the edifice is up to 6 m in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twidth, and in certain areas there may have been two parallel rows of rooms oriented north-south. This is borne\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tout by a couple of partition wall segments that create intermediate spaces near the north end of the structure.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSouth of the longitudinal wall the edifice widens to around 13 m, creating walls which run at right angles to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe axis of the structure. The ground plan of the south end of the building is not clear. On the west side of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe southern portion of the structure there was a narrow row of rooms or a passageway. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Affiliated sites","index":8,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Ma nam mkhar (East)","index":9,"parent_index":8,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>In addition to the famous 11th century CE Buddhist monastery of <span class=\"popular\">Manam</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ma nam</span>, situated in the valley bottom, there is a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tso-called castle<span class=\"emph\"> </span>on the summit of an earthen formation rising 250\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tm above <span class=\"popular\">Manam</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ma nam</span> village.
