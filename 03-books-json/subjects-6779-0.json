This process most likely extended from the latter half of the tenth century to the first half of the twelfth century in terms of the date of their Tibetan revelations, and the dominant eighth-century Indian patron of these texts prior to their treasure concealment and revelation was Vimalamitra. This is why most of the External and Internal Cycle texts are found in <em>The Collected Tantras of Vairocana<\/em>, most likely a twelfth-century collection, but the later Secret Cycle and Unsurpassed Secret Cycle were either not known to, or else not accepted by, the collection’s conservative editors. Padmasambhava simply had nothing to do with these transmissions or their mythos until a much later date.<br \/><br \/><\/p>","title":"An Overview of the Four Cycles"}]}
