   "body": "<p class=\"Paragraph\">The suffix <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">པ་</span> has two essential functions:</p><p class=\"Paragraph\">1. It denotes prototypically the <strong>grammatical patient</strong> of the verbal action in the perfective past. That is, it refers to the direct object when it is used with a transitive verb or the subject when it is used with an intransitive verb. (From a syntactic point of view, the nominalized verb functions here as a head noun or as a modifier of the head noun.)</p><p class=\"Paragraph\">Constructions using this nominalizer may be translated in English by using a relative clause or a past participle:</p><ul> <li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">བཟོས་པ་དེ་</span> “That which has been built”</li> <li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">བྲིས་པ་</span> “That which has been written”</li> <li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">དཀྲུས་པ་</span> “That which has been washed”</li> <li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">བསྡད་པ་</span> “(The person) who lived, sat” </li> <li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ཡོང་པ་</span> “(The person) who came”</li> <li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ངུས་པ་</span> “(The person) who cried”</li> <li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ཉ་པ་</span> “(The person) who went to bed” </li> </ul><p class=\"Paragraph\">However, it also extends to the subject of transitive benefactive verbs:</p><ul> <li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ཡོད་པ་</span> “(The person) who has”</li> <li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ཐོབ་པ་</span> “(The person) who has obtained”</li> </ul><p class=\"Paragraph\">2. The suffix <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">པ་</span> may also be neutral and nominalize the <strong>entire clause</strong>.</p><p class=\"Paragraph\">In this case, the suffix is not oriented toward any grammatical role and nominalizes the entire clause. From a syntactic point of view, the nominalized verb functions as a head noun and may be translated in English by a verb in the infinitive, an -<em>ing </em>clause, a <em>that </em>clause, or even by a noun.</p><ul> <li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ཨང་དང་པོ་ཐོབ་པ་དེར་ང་དགའ་པོ་བྱུང་།</span> “The fact that she took first place made me happy.”</li> <li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">བོད་སྐད་ཤེས་པ་དེ་གལ་ཆེན་པོ་རེད།</span> “It’s very important to know Tibetan.” Or, “Knowledge of Tibetan is very important.”</li> <li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">མགོ་ལ་སྐྲ་འཛུག་ཐུབ་པ་དེ་དཔེ་རང་རེད།</span> “To be able to plant hair on the head is incredible!”</li> </ul><p class=\"Paragraph\">It is only from the context that we can distinguish between the two functions described above, as the following examples show:</p><ul> <li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ད་གིན་ཡོང་པ་དེ་སུ་རེད།</span> “Who’s the person who came a short while ago?”</li> <li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">དེ་རིང་འདིར་ཡོང་པ་ཡག་པོ་བྱུང་གཞག</span> “It was a good thing / idea (for us) to come here today!”</li> </ul><p class=\"Paragraph\">What is being nominalized in the first case is the verb “to come” modifying the head noun “this one”; in the second, the clause “we came here today” is being nominalized.</p>",
