{"meta":{"authors":[{"id":"6","fullname":"Nicolas Tournadre"}],"title":"","dates":{"created_at":"2013-09-15 04:16:00 UTC","updated_at":"2013-09-15 04:16:00 UTC"}},"nodes":[{"index":0,"parent_index":-1,"body":"<p class=\"Paragraph\">The suffix <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">པ་</span> has two essential functions:</p>\n<p class=\"Paragraph\">1. It denotes prototypically the <strong>grammatical patient</strong> of the verbal action in the perfective past. That is, it refers to the direct object when it is used with a transitive verb or the subject when it is used with an intransitive verb. (From a syntactic point of view, the nominalized verb functions here as a head noun or as a modifier of the head noun.)</p>\n<p class=\"Paragraph\">Constructions using this nominalizer may be translated in English by using a relative clause or a past participle:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">བཟོས་པ་དེ་</span> &ldquo;That which has been built&rdquo;</li>\n<li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">བྲིས་པ་</span> &ldquo;That which has been written&rdquo;</li>\n<li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">དཀྲུས་པ་</span> &ldquo;That which has been washed&rdquo;</li>\n<li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">བསྡད་པ་</span> &ldquo;(The person) who lived, sat&rdquo; </li>\n<li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ཡོང་པ་</span> &ldquo;(The person) who came&rdquo;</li>\n<li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ངུས་པ་</span> &ldquo;(The person) who cried&rdquo;</li>\n<li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ཉ་པ་</span> &ldquo;(The person) who went to bed&rdquo; </li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"Paragraph\">However, it also extends to the subject of transitive benefactive verbs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ཡོད་པ་</span> &ldquo;(The person) who has&rdquo;</li>\n<li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ཐོབ་པ་</span> &ldquo;(The person) who has obtained&rdquo;</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"Paragraph\">2. The suffix <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">པ་</span> may also be neutral and nominalize the <strong>entire clause</strong>.</p>\n<p class=\"Paragraph\">In this case, the suffix is not oriented toward any grammatical role and nominalizes the entire clause. From a syntactic point of view, the nominalized verb functions as a head noun and may be translated in English by a verb in the infinitive, an -<em>ing </em>clause, a <em>that </em>clause, or even by a noun.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ཨང་དང་པོ་ཐོབ་པ་དེར་ང་དགའ་པོ་བྱུང་།</span> &ldquo;The fact that she took first place made me happy.&rdquo;</li>\n<li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">བོད་སྐད་ཤེས་པ་དེ་གལ་ཆེན་པོ་རེད།</span> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very important to know Tibetan.&rdquo; Or, &ldquo;Knowledge of Tibetan is very important.&rdquo;</li>\n<li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">མགོ་ལ་སྐྲ་འཛུག་ཐུབ་པ་དེ་དཔེ་རང་རེད།</span> &ldquo;To be able to plant hair on the head is incredible!&rdquo;</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"Paragraph\">It is only from the context that we can distinguish between the two functions described above, as the following examples show:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ད་གིན་ཡོང་པ་དེ་སུ་རེད།</span> &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the person who came a short while ago?&rdquo;</li>\n<li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">དེ་རིང་འདིར་ཡོང་པ་ཡག་པོ་བྱུང་གཞག</span> &ldquo;It was a good thing / idea (for us) to come here today!&rdquo;</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"Paragraph\">What is being nominalized in the first case is the verb &ldquo;to come&rdquo; modifying the head noun &ldquo;this one&rdquo;; in the second, the clause &ldquo;we came here today&rdquo; is being nominalized.</p>","title":""}]}
