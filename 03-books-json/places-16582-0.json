Such a facility could potentially\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thave been the refuge of several tens of inhabitants. The main edifice measures 11.5 m (north-south) x 26 m\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(east-west), roughly equivalent in size to the modern monastic complex of <span class=\"popular\">Dzuntr&uuml;l Puk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdzu &rsquo;phrul phug</span>. Partially dressed variable-sized stones (primarily\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbetween 10 cm and 70 cm long) were used in construction. Most walls were mud mortared but some also appear to be\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the dry-mortar variety. In one wall towards the middle of the main edifice, near the primary south-facing\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tentranceway, chink-stones were inserted into the wall joints, a construction technique common in historical era\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbuildings of Central Tibet. Many of the walls of the main edifice still reach\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1.8 m in height. The highest elevation wall (2.5 m) is the outer southwest corner of the structure. The interior\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdimensions of most rooms range between 2.3 m x 1.7 m (4 m&sup2;) and 3.7 m x 3 m (11 m&sup2;). The smallest room in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmain edifice measures 1.8 m x 70 cm.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The rear of the main edifice was built into a ledge that helps to form the north wall. The rear portion of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstructure contains a single line of ten larger rooms aligned east-west. The third room from the west end of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmain edifice (rampart R3) has part of its stone roof intact. The longest in situ bridging stone is 1.3 m. R3 was\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpartially divided into two sections, one of which has three niches in the walls. The largest cubby-hole measures\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t50 cm x 50 cm x 50 cm. The other subdivision of R3 has the remains of a hearth. The entrance to this room is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlargely complete (1.2 m x 70 cm). Both its lintel (1.1 m in length) and sill are in place. R3 must have been\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tused by <span class=\"popular\">Zhapkar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Zhabs dkar</span> for household chores. It is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe only room at the site that is still in relatively good condition, and this may point its refurbishment by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe celebrated lama. The actual <span class=\"popular\">Zhapkar Drup Puk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Zhabs dkar sgrub phug</span> is located to the north or rear of R3. This subterranean chamber is set about 1.7 m below its\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tanteroom. A 70-cm wide stone stairway leads down to the small chamber, which was probably the geomantic nexus of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe ancient facility. This room is lined with masonry on three sides, while its rear wall and roof are part of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe formation into which it was built. <span class=\"popular\">Zhapkar Drup Puk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Zhabs dkar sgrub phug</span> proper contains a stone sleep platform, and along the rear wall there is an altar with\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ta niche for a ritual water vase (<span class=\"popular emph\">bhumpa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">bum pa</span>). This subterranean\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tchamber affords excellent shelter from the elements, but I venture to speculate that due to the archaic cultural\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\torigin of the site, it was never particularly popular with Buddhist practitioners.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>In front of the anteroom to <span class=\"popular\">Zhapkar Drup Puk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Zhabs dkar sgrub phug</span> there appears to have been a row of four small rooms running perpendicular (north-south) to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe rear line of ten rooms. What was the main entrance to main edifice is located in the south wall, east of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trow of four rooms. The forward or south wall east of this destroyed entrance structurally incorporates a natural\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twall of stone into its construction. The east forward portion of the main edifice may have served as a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcourtyard. To the north of this open space lie the six east rooms of the rear row. There also seems to have been\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttwo forward rooms on the east end of the main edifice. A forward room on the west side of the edifice possesses\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tan in situ corbel and bridging stone. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"The dependencies","index":8,"parent_index":6,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Below the west side of the forward wall of the main edifice there are other structural remains, which probably\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconstituted two or three rooms.

Three meters west\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the rear west wall of the main edifice there is an isolated building (2 m x 2 m x 1.5 m), with its corbelled\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstone roof still whole.
