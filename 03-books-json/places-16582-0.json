They cover an area of 4.5 m (north-south) x 10 m (east-west). Three meters west of the rear west wall of the main edifice there is an isolated building (2 m x 2 m x 1.5 m), with its corbelled stone roof still whole. Its entranceway (1.3 m x 50 cm) lintel is still in place. There are two rooms inside his structure with a small doorway between them. In the rear room there are several niches in the walls. Several meters east of the east wall of the main edifice there are the faint remains of another small building (4.5 m x 2 m). About 10 m above the main edifice there are fractional foundations clinging to the side of a cliff. They seem to have given rise to two buildings approximately measuring 6 m x 8 m and 8.5 m x 4 m. In the latter structure the forward\/south wall reaches 2 m in height. <\/p> "},{"title":"Proximate sites","index":9,"parent_index":6,"body":null},{"title":"rDzu &rsquo;phrul phug (Cave of Miracles)","index":10,"parent_index":6,"body":null}]}
