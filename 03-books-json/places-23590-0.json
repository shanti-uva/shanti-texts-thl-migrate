It is a very small establishment. Its only monk, Pad ma, was studying at rTogs ldan Monastery (No.178) in rNga khog as Ka ca is regarded as a branch of rTogs ldan, even though no one knows how and when the connection was established. When I visited the monastery 1998 there was only one elderly caretaker in the monastery. So far, no written records are available.<\/p> "}]}
