Geographically, <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15478\">Huar&eacute;</span> is located in the northeastern part of the Tibetan Plateau, and it covers the north and south sides of the eastern end of Qilian Mountain. <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Tsenpo Tenzin Trinl&eacute;</span>'s (<em><span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">btsan po bstan &lsquo;dzin &lsquo;phrin las</span></em>) early 19<sup>th</sup> century <em><span class=\"tibtext\" title=\"Type ID here\">&lsquo;dzam gling rgyas bshad</span></em> (<em><span class=\"tibtext\" title=\"Type ID here\">Vast Explanation of the World</span></em>), described two parts of <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15478\">Huar&eacute;</span>, <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Amdo Huar&eacute;</span>, which is synonymous with the region described above, and defined by him according to the location of the main monasteries of the region, and <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Lower Pari</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">dpa' ri smad</span></em>), which included the main monasteries of Minhe (Tib. <em><span class=\"place\" title=\"F1153\">bka' ma log</span></em>&nbsp;or \"<span class=\"place\" title=\"F1153\">Kamalok</span>\") county <em>(</em><span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\"><em>btsan po nomonhan &lsquo;jam dpal chos lyi bstan &lsquo;dzin &lsquo;phrin las</em></span>, <em><span class=\"tibtext\" title=\"Type ID here\">&lsquo;dzam gling rgyas bshad</span></em>.

Although there are different stories about the ancestry of <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15478\">Huar&eacute;</span> Tibetans, most people agree that they&nbsp;are descended primarily from the Tibetan troops sent to the frontier during the Tibetan imperial period, some Tibetan tribes that migrated to the east, as well as through intermarriage with other local people such as the Qiang, Tuguhun (土固浑) and Han. Qiaogao Cairang, Li Chenseng and Zhouta claim that the earliest Tibetans came to the <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15478\">Huar&eacute;</span> area in 699 when Zangpo and Mang Buzhi took their tribes to settle in today&rsquo;s Tianzhu and Gulang. However, <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dorzhi</span> (<em><span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">dor zhi</span></em>) has challenged the assumption that before that period there were no Tibetans in this region. In the&nbsp;<em></em><span class=\"tibtext\" title=\"Type ID here\"><em>huare zhes pa&rsquo;i ming dang huare bod rigs kyi mched khungs la dpyad p</em>a</span> (1996), <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dorzhi</span> argues that Tibetans lived in this area much earlier by asserting that the Qiang people were actually ancestors of the Tibetans. He says: &ldquo;The historical sources from the Zhou Dynasty 3000 years ago mention that Qiang people lived around <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Nu mtsho</span>/<span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">mtsho sngon</span>&rdquo; (p.6). According to him, the Chinese word for Tibetans, Zangzu (藏族), was a later invention that first appeared in Yuan Dynasty.</p>\n<p><strong>Who Ruled Huar&eacute;?</strong></p>\n<p>The <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15478\">Huar&eacute;</span> region became Tibetanized in the seventh century when the Tibetan King <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Songtsen Gampo</span> (<span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\"><em>srong btsan sgam po</em></span>) established a powerful Tibetan empire. In the mid-eighth century, at the peak of their power, Tibetans occupied Hexi and Longyou (陇右). In 764, Tibetans took over Liangzhou (today&rsquo;s Weiwu City in Gansu) and directly ruled the area for about a hundred years. As a result, the area became predominantly Tibetan. Later in the ninth century, the unified Tibetan empire fell apart and various regional polities began to emerge. A local polity was established in the <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15478\">Huar&eacute;</span> region, particularly in the Hexi Corridor north of the Nanshan range. In 861 the Tang took Liangzhou back, but the Tibetans continued to control the area by paying tribute to the ruling power until the early Song period. In the early Northern Song period, a Tibetan polity was again formed in Liangzhou. This Tibetan polity, with Lingzhou at its center, was called the&nbsp;<span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Six Tibetan Valleys of Huar&eacute;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;(Tib. <em><span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">huare bod lung drug</span></em>, Ch. Liangzhou liu gu fan bu, 凉州六谷蕃部). The authors of the&nbsp;<em>Huare zang zu shi lue</em> state that this polity was fundamental in shaping the <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15478\">Huar&eacute;</span> we know today. From the late Tang to the Northern Song, a Tibetan family named <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Zhepu</span>, (Tib. <em><span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">rje bo</span></em>, Ch. Zhepu shi jiazu, 折逋氏家族) ruled the area. The three authors mentioned above argue that the Song did not have their own administrative system in place, even though they established Xiliang prefecture (Xiliang fu, 西凉府) in Liangzhou. Instead, they simply used the approach of &ldquo;using &lsquo;barbarians&rsquo; to rule &lsquo;barbarians&rsquo;&rdquo; (Ch. <em>yi yi zhi yi</em>, 以夷制夷); in other words, they used Tibetans to rule Tibetans. In 1003, the Song put a Tibetan named <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pen Lodr&ouml;</span> (<em><span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">'phen blo bros</span></em>, Ch. Panluozhi , 潘罗支) in charge of the area, but he died soon thereafter. His death, caused by an accident, started an internal power struggle within Xiliang prefecture, and Tibetan power began to decline. In 1015, the six Tibetan groups of Liangzhou were overthrown and they were forced to join Jiaosiluo&rsquo;s (Tib. <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Joselak</span>,&nbsp;<em><span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">jo sras lags</span></em>, 997-1065) regime in <span class=\"place\" title=\"F1152\">Tsongkha</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"F1152\">tsong kha</span></em>). After that, the Xixia (Tib. <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Minyak</span>, <em><span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">mi nyag</span></em>) dynasty controlled Liangzhou for 190 years. According to <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dorzhi</span>, the Xixia was primarily made up of a group of Tibetans called the <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dongchang</span> (<em><span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">ldong spyang</span></em>, Ch. Dangxiang, 党项). He argues that their cultural practices, religious beliefs, language and clothing show that they were Tibetan.</p>\n<p>After the fall of the <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Six Tibetan Valleys of Huar&eacute;</span>&nbsp;, Jiaosiluo, who was a direct descendant of the Tibetan King <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Langdarma</span> (<em><span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">glang dar ma</span></em>), established a powerful polity in the eastern part of Qinghai in the <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Tsongchu</span>&nbsp;river valley. During this time period, <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15478\">Huar&eacute;</span> came under the rule of Jiaosiluo. When he died, his three sons ruled their own areas and fought each other for power. After his last son Dongzhan died in 1100, Jiaosiluo&rsquo;s polity came to an end.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Religion </strong></p>\n<p>From the Five Dynasties period (Ch. Wu dai, 五代) to the early Song dynasty, the <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Six Tibetan Valleys of Huar&eacute;</span>&nbsp;ruled Liangzhou. During this period, the <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Nyingma</span> (<em><span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">rnying ma</span></em>) sect and the <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">B&ouml;n</span> (<em><span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">bon</span></em>) tradition took root here. When the <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Minyak</span>/ Xixia came to rule Liangzhou, they promoted Buddhism and it developed even more. In 1159, the <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Minyak</span> emperor Ren Xiaozong invited the founder of the <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kagy&uuml;</span> (<em><span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">bka&rsquo; brgyud</span></em>) sect to come and disseminate his teachings, and so&nbsp;<span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Tsang Zangpo</span> (<em><span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">gtsang bzang bo</span></em>) came and became the main lama. Monasteries such as Chengtian Si and Dayun Si were built. For the next two hundred years, under the rule of the Xixia, other sects, not just the <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Nyingma</span> and <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kagy&uuml;</span>, became popular.&nbsp; During the Song and Yuan dynasties, the <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kagy&uuml;</span> sect spread in this area. The second, third, fourth and fifth <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Karmapa</span>s (<em><span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">karma pa</span></em>) carried out their missionary activities and built some influential monasteries such as <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Karma Ritr&ouml;</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">karma ri khrod</span></em>, Ch. Bailing si) and <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Taj&eacute; G&ouml;n</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">rta rjes dgon</span></em>, Ch. Mati si). However, during the Yuan dynasty the <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kagy&uuml;</span> sect was replaced by the <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Sakya</span> (<em><span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">sa skya</span></em>).</p>\n<p>In 1226, the Mongols seized Liangzhou. In 1236, the Mongol prince G&ouml;dan (Ch. Kuoduan) stationed himself there.&nbsp; In 1246, at G&ouml;dan&rsquo;s invitation, <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Sakya K&uuml;nga Gyeltsen</span> (<em><span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">sa skya kun dga&rsquo; rgyal mtshan</span></em>), who was also called <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Sakya Pandita</span>, arrived in Liangzhou with his two nephews, <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pakpa Lodr&ouml; Gyeltsen</span> (<em><span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">'phags pa blo gros rgyal mtshan</span></em>) and <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Chakna Dorj&eacute;</span> (<em><span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">phyag na rdo rje</span></em>). During the four or five years he spent in Liangzhou, he built four monasteries including <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Shartr&uuml;l Ped&eacute;</span>&nbsp;(<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">shar sprul pa'i sde</span></em>, Ch. Baita si), <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Lhowang D&eacute;</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">lho dbang sde</span></em>, Ch. Jinta si), <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Nup Pemod&eacute;</span>&nbsp;(<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">nub pad mo sde</span></em>, Ch. Xilianhu si) and <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Janggya Tsod&eacute;</span>&nbsp;(<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">byang rgya mtsho sde</span></em>, Ch. Beihaizang si). Later when <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pakpa</span> became the &ldquo;imperial preceptor&rdquo; (Ch. dishi, 帝师), the <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Sakya</span> sect gained dominance and grew rapidly. Many monasteries that had previously belonged to the <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kagy&uuml;</span> and <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Nyingma</span> sects were converted to the <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Sakya</span> tradition.</p>\n<p>During the Ming Dynasty, <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Tsongkhapa</span> (<em><span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">tsong kha pa</span></em>) initiated the <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Geluk</span> (<em><span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">dge lugs</span></em>) sect, and it became widespread. In the late Ming and early Qing, many monasteries were built in <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15478\">Huar&eacute;</span>. Except for a few, the majority were <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Geluk</span> monasteries. To this day, the <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Geluk</span> sect has remained dominant in this area.</p>\n<p>To sum up, the general religious history of the region shows that the <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">B&ouml;n</span> tradition came first to <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15478\">Huar&eacute;</span> followed in chronological order by the <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Nyingma</span>, <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kagy&uuml;</span>, <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Sakya</span>, and <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Geluk</span> sects. To some extent, this development pattern reflects the different time periods when these sects were dominant. However, it does not seem to be the case that all the monasteries in <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15478\">Huar&eacute;</span> have developed in this way. In fact, the histories of the monasteries sometimes tell a different story. For example, <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Ch&ouml;rten Tang</span> Monastery (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">mchod rten thang</span></em>, Ch. Tiantang Si) is a major monastery in Tianzhu. Originally it was a <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">B&ouml;n</span> monastery, and was built during the Tang emperor Xianzong&rsquo;s reign (806-822). In 1360, the fourth <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Karmapa</span> passed through there on his way to Beijing. He built a stupa (or <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ch&ouml;rten</span>,&nbsp;<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">mchod rten</span></em>) there, and the monastery was converted to the <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kagy&uuml;</span> sect. In 1639, the monastery was converted to the <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Geluk</span> sect, and it has remained so to this day.</p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n<p>Btsan po nomonhan &lsquo;Jam dpal chos lyi bstan &lsquo;dzin &lsquo;phrin las. <em><span class=\"tibtext\" title=\"Type ID here\">&lsquo;dzam gling rgyas bshad</span></em>.
