This small enclosure (2.5 m x 1.5 m) has three single-course walls and one double-course wall (east), and is divided into two parts by a double-course wall, consisting of three stones in each course. The enclosure walls are primarily made of pieces of gray granite (up to 50 cm long), which protrude upwards of 20 cm above ground level. This structure is not aligned in the cardinal directions. Located on level shelf in a limestone formation, it is in close proximity to an old abandoned pastoral camp. <\/p><p>In the limestone formation, near the funerary structure of phru gu dbyar kha, there is a small cave with around one dozen obscured swastikas on its walls. They were drawn using orange-red ochre. Probably all but one of these swastikas face in a counterclockwise direction. Some have been dabbed with butter, possibly in the worship of the local territorial deity (<span class=\"popular\">y\u00fcllha<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Yul lha<\/span>).
