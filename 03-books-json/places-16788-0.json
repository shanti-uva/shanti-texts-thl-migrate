The height of the east side of the structure can be partly accounted for by a depression in the adjacent terrain. The fragmentary, double-course (60 cm thick) north rim wall is 30 cm in height and is composed of three vertical courses of stones. On the other flanks of the structure there are many stones but without any discernable pattern. On the north and west portions of the top of he mound there are wall traces, which appear to divide the structure into smaller units. Variable length (primarily 20 cm to 50 cm long) uncut, blue and tan metamorphic stones were used in construction of <span class=\"popular\">Ronglung<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Rong lung<\/span>. There are also some pieces of red sandstone at the site. <\/p>  "}]}
