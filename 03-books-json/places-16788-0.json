The site is in view of <span class=\"popular\">Neri Tsongön</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gnas ri mtsho sngon</span>/<span class=\"popular\">Namarche Tso</span><span class=\"scholar\">Na mar che mtsho</span>. The terrain is moderately sloping and blanketed in alpine turf. The rectangular mound of <span class=\"popular\">Ronglung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rong lung</span> is oriented in the cardinal directions and measures 15 m (east-west) x 12.4 m (north-south). Its large size, isolated aspect and lofty position suggest that it featured in the interment/burial rites of a very high status individual or individuals. This structure exhibits the morphological features of both the <span class=\"popular emph\">bangso</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">bang so</span> and terraced funerary constructions. The latter constitutes a very common type of funerary structure in the far eastern <span class=\"popular\">Jangtang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Byang thang</span>. <span class=\"popular\">Ronglung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rong lung</span> is turf-covered and does not appear to have been disturbed in a long time.</p>",

The height of the east side of the structure can be partly accounted for by a depression in the adjacent terrain. The fragmentary, double-course (60 cm thick) north rim wall is 30 cm in height and is composed of three vertical courses of stones. On the other flanks of the structure there are many stones but without any discernable pattern. On the north and west portions of the top of he mound there are wall traces, which appear to divide the structure into smaller units. Variable length (primarily 20 cm to 50 cm long) uncut, blue and tan metamorphic stones were used in construction of <span class=\"popular\">Ronglung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rong lung</span>. There are also some pieces of red sandstone at the site. </p>",
