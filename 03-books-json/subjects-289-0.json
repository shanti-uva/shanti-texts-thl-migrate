   "body": "<p class=\"Paragraph\">Both the spoken and literary languages contain case-marking particles that specify the function of a noun within a sentence:</p><p>1. Absolutive (unmarked)</p><p>2. Agentive <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">གིས་</span></p><p>3. Genitive <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">གི་</span></p><p>4. Oblique <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ལ་</span></p><p>5. Ablative <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ནས་</span></p><p>6. Associative <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">དང་</span></p><p class=\"Paragraph\">In English, these cases are represented by prepositions such as “to,” “of,” “in,” “by,” or “for,” or else are not translated at all.</p><p class=\"Paragraph\">The system of cases in Tibetan is quite distinct from that of European languages such as Latin, Greek, German, and Russian, for a number of reasons:</p><p class=\"Paragraph\">First of all, contrary to the case of these languages, the noun remains invariable. Instead, it makes use of particles or suffixes that vary in form. Some case suffixes, for example, vary according to the final letter (or sound) of the preceding word.</p><p class=\"Paragraph\">Literary Tibetan and to a lesser extent the spoken language show some features of agglutinative morphology. That is, the case suffixes and the other grammatical suffixes are added on in a series. For example, the plural marker is marked by a suffix distinct from the case (unlike the cases in Latin or Russian). In the following sentences in Literary Tibetan, the head nouns ལུས་ “body” and མཁས་པ་ “learned” are followed by three suffixes:</p><ul> <li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">མཁས་པ་རྣམས་ཀྱིས་ཀྱང་མ་གཟིགས་</span> “Even the learned ones have not seen (it).”</li> </ul><p class=\"Paragraph\">In this first example, མཁས་པ་ is followed by a plural marker, the agentive particle, and an additive particle. In the following example, ལུས་ is followed by a possession suffix, a plural marker, and finally the genitive particle:</p><ul> <li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ལུས་ཅན་དག་གི་ལས་</span> “The karma of those who have a body….”</li> </ul><p class=\"Paragraph\">There is no agreement on the basis of function within a noun group: the case appears just once, at the end of the noun phrase, and there is consequently no redundancy.</p><p class=\"Paragraph\">For example, if the noun is not followed by any qualification such as adjectives, demonstratives and so forth, the case particle is suffixed directly:</p><ul> <li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">དཔོན་པོས་</span> “By the leader” (agentive)</li> <li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">དཔོན་པོ་ལ་</span> “To the leader” (dative)</li> </ul><p class=\"Paragraph\">But if the noun is qualified, the final element of the noun group is followed by a case particle:</p><ul> <li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">དཔོན་པོ་ཆེན་པོ་འདི་གཉིས་ཀྱིས་</span> “By these two great leaders”</li> <li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">དཔོན་པོ་ཆེན་པོ་འདི་གཉིས་ལ་</span> “To these two great leaders” </li> </ul><p class=\"Paragraph\">Cases have a range of functions that are not confined to the noun, but also relate to the verb. Thus all case markers have two basic functions: a case-related function and a connective function.<a href=\"#_ftn1\">[1]</a> The latter is comparable to a coordinating or subordinating conjunction in European languages. (See the discussion below on the ablative case xxlink 9.3.2)</p><p> </p><hr size=\"1\"><p><a href=\"#_ftnref1\">[1]</a> My presentation of case does not reflect the Tibetan grammatical tradition, which is based on Sanskrit, a sacred language for Tibetans. (Sanskrit is an Indo-European language entirely different in its structures from the Tibeto-Burman languages.) The Tibetan tradition usually mentions eight cases corresponding to the eight Sanskrit cases in the following order: first case: <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ངོ་བོ་ཙམ་</span> “absolutive” (Ø), second case: <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ལས་སུ་བྱ་བ་</span> “accusative” (<span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ལ་</span> or its variants), third case: <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">བྱེད་སྒྲ་</span> “agentive” or “instrumental” (<span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">གིས་</span> and its variants), fourth case: <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">དགོས་ཆེད་</span> “dative” (<span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ལ་</span> or its variants), fifth case: <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">འབྱུང་ཁུངས་</span> “ablative” (<span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ནས་</span> or <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ལས་</span>), sixth case: <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">འབྲེལ་སྒྲ་</span> “genitive” (<span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">གི་</span> or its variants), seventh case: <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">གནས་གཞི་</span> “locative” (<span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ལ་</span> or its variants), eighth case: <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">འབོད་སྒྲ་</span> “vocative” (Ø).</p>",
