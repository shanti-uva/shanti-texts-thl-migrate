Covering an area of more than 15,000 m&sup2;, this\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsizable habitation was founded on the foot of a hill bounding the west side of the <span class=\"popular\">Gar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sgar</span> valley. Hundreds of people must have once resided here\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin a dense agglomeration of houses. Unlike the nearby contemporary village of Castle Valley, with its five households, the height of old Castle Valley affords it protection from floods, which have been\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tparticularly severe in the last decade. According to local residents, old Castle Valley is connected to a Tibetan ruler who ruled the region before the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"popular\">Namrup&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gnam ru dpon</span> of the <span class=\"popular emph\">Ganden Podrang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">dga' ldan pho brang</span> period (1660-1959 CE). The settlement,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thowever, is also associated with the <span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span>, which may\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsuggest that its foundations date to the prehistoric epoch or early historic period. It is certainly possible\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat important magnets of sedentary settlement in the moist and fertile <span class=\"popular\">Gar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sgar</span> valley enjoyed a very long period of tenure.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The buildings of the old settlement have been largely leveled and only fragmentary wall footings, wall\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsegments, pits, and rocky mounds are left. In recent years, some of the stones have been used to build corrals\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ton the site. At the upper end of the village there are a few adobe wall segments heralding the location of a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBuddhist temple, which included a chapel called <span class=\"popular\">Kharlung G&ouml;nkhang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mkhar lung mgon khang</span>. This protector chapel was destroyed long before\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tliving memory. It is reported that the deities <span class=\"popular\">Penden Lhamo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dpal ldan lha mo</span> and <span class=\"popular\">G&ouml;npo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mgon po</span> were worshipped here. In the vicinity are several ruined a type of shrine. Approximately 1 km southwest of the village is a ruined\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tresidential structure said to have been the residence of a district headman. Agricultural lands run right up to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthis ruined homestead. This once substantial building (19 m x 23 m) contained at least eight large rooms. It was\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tprimarily constructed of mud-mortared cobble walls, 50 cm to 80 cm in thickness. Wall fragments up to 2.5 m in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\theight have survived. Most walls are partially intact, thus the structure is in far better condition than those\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin old Castle Valley village. In a central wall partition\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(runs north-south) there is a window (30 cm x 60 cm) whose lintel of tamarisk rounds is intact. Immediately to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe south is a less well-preserved building (6 m x 14 m), said to have been a kitchen \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(<span class=\"popular emph\">taptsang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">thab\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttshang</span>).

Grain output in sgar may have once been sufficient\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto feed several thousand people, engaging hundreds of farmers. Nowadays, in stark contrast, a handful of farmers\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin each village struggle to produce any barley at all.

This is due to a lack of manpower and a chronic shortage of water.
