Perhaps the golden age of <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dzokchen<\/span> Monastery was the second half of the nineteenth century, when its seminary became a leading center of <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Nyingma<\/span> scholarship and contemplation. In the present-day <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dzokchen<\/span> Monastery is once again a vibrant and wealthy monastery with a very large assembly hall, and excellent facilities and instruction at its seminary and retreat center.<\/p><p><span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pema Rindzin<\/span> was born in <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Riwoch\u00e9<\/span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ri bo che<\/span><\/em>) in 1625 and his father was a Nepali ritual dancer and craftsperson. In his twenties and thirties he studied with many eminent lamas in <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kham<\/span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">khams<\/span><\/em>) and southeastern Tibet, including <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Karma Chakm\u00e9\u00a0<\/span>(<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">karma chags med<\/span><\/em>),\u00a0<span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">D\u00fcnd\u00fcl Dorj\u00e9\u00a0<\/span>(<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">bdud 'dul rdo rje<\/span><\/em>), and <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Namch\u00f6 Mingyur Dorj\u00e9\u00a0<\/span>(<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">rnam chos mi 'gyur rdo rje<\/span><\/em>). In 1664, at age forty, he traveled to central Tibet for further instruction and retreat. There he entered into the elite <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Nyingma<\/span> circle of the Fifth Dalai Lama and the lamas of <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Mindr\u00f6lling<\/span>\u00a0(<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">smin grol gling<\/span><\/em>) and <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dorj\u00e9 Drak<\/span>\u00a0(<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">rdo rje brag<\/span><\/em>) monasteries. Additionally, around this time <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pema Rindzin<\/span> teamed up with two lamas that would join him for the founding of <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dzokchen<\/span> Monastery: treasure revealer <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Nyima Drakpa<\/span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">nyi ma grags pa<\/span><\/em>, 1647-1710) and <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Rapjam Tenp\u00e9 Gyentsen<\/span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">rab 'byams bstan pa'i rgyal mtshan<\/span><\/em>, b. 1650). The principal spiritual tradition they established at the new monastery was the <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Khandro Nyingtik<\/span> (<em><span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">mkha' 'gro snying thig<\/span><\/em>), a treasure tradition codified by <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Longchenpa<\/span>\u00a0(<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">klong chen pa<\/span><\/em>, 1308-1363) in the fourteenth century and promoted at <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Mindr\u00f6lling<\/span>. In the early days of the monastery <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Khandro Nyingtik<\/span> festivals were held twice or thrice yearly.<\/p><p>After nearly twenty years in Central Tibet the Fifth Dalai Lama made the prophetic declaration that <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pema Rindzin<\/span> would go to <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kham<\/span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">mdo smad<\/span><\/em>) and that his \u201cbenefit to the teachings and beings would be extensive and his religious lineage will flourish.\u201d\u00a0<span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pema Rindzin<\/span> arrived in <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Deg\u00e9<\/span> in 1684, at the age of sixty, and became a court chaplain of the king <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Sanggy\u00e9 Tenpa\u00a0<\/span>(<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">sangs rgyas bstan pa<\/span><\/em>). The following year \u2013 1685 \u2013 king <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Sanggy\u00e9 Tenpa<\/span>\u00a0and the king of <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Lingtsang<\/span> sponsored the founding of <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dzokchen<\/span> Monastery. The full name of the monastery is <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Orgyen Samten Ch\u00f6ling<\/span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">o rgyan bsam gtan chos gling<\/span><\/em>) and it is located in a nomadic region along <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Deg\u00e9<\/span>\u2019s northern frontier. Certainly geo-political concerns informed the selection of this site, at least for the king of <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Deg\u00e9<\/span>. In the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries Oirat Mongols inhabited a significant amount of territory in the local highlands and <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Deg\u00e9<\/span> wanted to expand its presence in the same region, such as through the placement of a <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Deg\u00e9<\/span>-affiliated monastery.<\/p><p>For reasons that are still unclear, neither of <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pema Rindzin<\/span>\u2019s two closest associates \u2013 <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Nyima Drakpa<\/span> and <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Rapjam Tenp\u00e9 Gyentsen<\/span> \u2013 accepted his request to take over the monastery upon his retirement. Thus after both declined the offer, <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">P\u00f6nlop Rinpoch\u00e9 Namkha \u00d6sel<\/span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">dpon slob nam mkha' 'od gsal<\/span><\/em>,\u00a0d.1726) became the head of the monastery. After <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pema Rindzin<\/span>\u2019s death in 1697 there was a contentious search for his reincarnation. At this time succession by reincarnation was just taking hold at <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Nyingma<\/span> monasteries in Tibet, and in <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Deg\u00e9<\/span> more generally. More than one candidate was proposed by the different parties involved in the search, at least one of which was born into an important Oirat Mongolian family. Eventually the royal court and the <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Nyingma<\/span> lamas in central Tibet selected the Mongolian candidate. Upon the deaths of <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">P\u00f6nlop Rinpoch\u00e9<\/span> and <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Rapjam Rinpoch\u00e9<\/span>, reincarnation lines were instituted at <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dzokchen<\/span> for them as well. For the first couple of generations of reincarnate lamas at <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dzokchen<\/span>, <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Mindr\u00f6lling<\/span> played a role in their recognition but especially in their training, as many of Dzokchen's tr\u00fclkus spent years at <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Mindr\u00f6lling<\/span> during their formative years.<\/p><p>The reincarnation of <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pema Rindzin<\/span>, named <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Gyurm\u00e9 Tekchok Tendzin<\/span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">'gyur med theg mchog bstan 'dzin<\/span><\/em>; b. 1699) known as the second <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dzokchen Rinpoch\u00e9<\/span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">rdzogs chen rin po che<\/span><\/em>), was arguably the most powerful <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Nyingma<\/span> lama in <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Deg\u00e9<\/span> in the 1730s, 40s, and 50s. This was the period of the editing and publication of the renowned <span class=\"tibtext\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kangyur<\/span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">bka' 'gyur<\/span><\/em>) and <span class=\"tibtext\" title=\"Type ID here\">Tengyur<\/span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">bstan 'gyur<\/span><\/em>) in <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Deg\u00e9<\/span>. When he produced an edition of the writings of the great fourteenth-century <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Nyingma<\/span> systematizer <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Longchenpa<\/span> at the <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Deg\u00e9 Printery<\/span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">sde dge par khang<\/span><\/em>), the second <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dzokchen Rinpoch\u00e9<\/span> became the first <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Nyingma<\/span> lama to participate in this prestigious court-sponsored activity. The catalog to this four-volume set is a great document for the early history of the monastery and for the kingdom during its so-called golden age.<\/p><p>In the eighteenth century <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dzokchen<\/span> lamas established branch monasteries in a few locales in <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kham<\/span>, especially in the frontier region of <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Gyelrong<\/span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">rgyal rong<\/span><\/em>). In the early nineteenth century the head <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dzokchen<\/span> lamas enthusiastically adopted a new and popular set of revelations called the <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Longchen Nyingtik<\/span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">klong chen snying thig<\/span><\/em>) and they became a central component of the spiritual program at the monastery.<\/p><p>1842 was a major year in <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kham<\/span>, and at <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dzokchen<\/span>. At the macro level, a devastating earthquake that year caused tremendous destruction throughout much of northern <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kham<\/span>. Firsthand accounts of the event can be found in the autobiographies of nineteenth-century lamas such as <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kongtr\u00fcl Yonten Gyatso\u00a0<\/span>(<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">kong sprul yon tan rgya mtsho<\/span><\/em>).\u00a0<span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kongtr\u00fcl<\/span> wrote that he was working on a composition, \u201cwhen the region from <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Horkhok<\/span> to <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Rudam<\/span> and <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Lingtshang<\/span> was hit with a violent earthquake\u201d (p.52); <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Rudam<\/span> being synonymous with <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dzokchen<\/span> Monastery. Prior to this <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dzokchen<\/span>\u00a0Monastery had a fledgling study program but its facilities were destroyed in the quake. In the aftermath of the disaster the eminent <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Nyingma<\/span> scholar <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Zhenpen Thay\u00e9<\/span>\u00a0(<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">gzhan phan mtha' yas<\/span><\/em>) was asked to rebuild <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dzokchen<\/span> and establish a proper seminary based on the <em><span class=\"tibtext\" title=\"Type ID here\">Secret Nucleus Tantra<\/span><\/em> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">rgyud gsang ba'i snying po<\/span><\/em>), the key exegetical esoteric scripture in the <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Nyingma<\/span> school. The seminary was one of the first of its kind in <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Deg\u00e9<\/span> and became the longest continuously running named seminary in <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Deg\u00e9<\/span>. In the early nineteenth century <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Katok<\/span> had a popular study program centered around <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Gets\u00e9 Mahapandita Gyurm\u00e9 Tsewang Chokdrup<\/span>\u00a0(<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">dge rtse ma hA paN+Dita 'gyur med tshe dbang mchog grub<\/span><\/em>) that attracted important <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Nyingma<\/span> reincarnate lamas, yet it was not a named institution that survived its founder\u2019s passing. The seminary at <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dzokchen<\/span>, however, did establish a line of succession beginning with the founder\u2019s successor that persisted through the early decades of the twentienth century. <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Do Drupchen Yesh\u00e9 Dorj\u00e9\u00a0<\/span>(<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">mdo grub chen ye shes rdo rje<\/span><\/em>), the reincarnation of <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Jikm\u00e9 Lingpa<\/span>\u00a0(<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">'jigs med gling pa<\/span><\/em>) and a graduate of the institute at <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Katok<\/span> was another important early figure in the history of the <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dzokchen<\/span> seminary. He decided on its location and gave it its name.<\/p><p>Writing in English, the contemporary <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Nyingma<\/span> lama and historian <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Tulku Thondup<\/span> praises <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Zhenpen Thay\u00e9<\/span> for three distinct contributions to <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dzokchen<\/span> Monastery and the <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Nyingma<\/span> school more broadly; the first of the three deeds being his founding of the seminary. Secondly, \u201cHe made the Vinaya, or monastic discipline, into the practice of daily life and established annual rainy-season retreats for the monks at <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dzogchen<\/span> Monastery.\u201d Thirdly, <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Zhenphen Thay\u00e9<\/span> compiled a collection of the <span class=\"tibtext\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kama<\/span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">bka' ma<\/span><\/em>) teachings \u2013 root tantras, commentaries, and liturgies on the three inner tantras of the <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Nyingma<\/span> school \u2013 and propagated the initiations for the thirteen key <span class=\"tibtext\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kama<\/span> practice traditions.<a name=\"n1\" href=\"#fn1\">[1]<\/a><\/p><p>The British officer Oliver R.

There are over a thousand lamas, of whom three to four hundred are in permanent residence. The lamasery is situated on the side of a ridge at the lower end of a narrow marsh or lake and has a magnificent view of the beautiful glacier streaked peak <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Norbuyukyal<\/span> which rises abruptly from the further end. The lama\u2019s (<em>sic<\/em>) dwellings are built in irregular clusters round the temple buildings and are not enclosed within a wall. The buildings are not so fine as those of the Horpa lamaseries but the images and chortens inside are magnificent. Below the lamasery is a village of 30 miserable huts where the lamasery serfs live. I was well received by the lamas and was housed in the comfortable residence of one of the reincarnations. The lamasery is 13,300 feet above sea level.<a name=\"n1\" href=\"#fn1\">[2]<\/a><\/p><p>The monastery was completely destroyed during the Cultural Revolution.
