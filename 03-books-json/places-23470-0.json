Before 1959, there were eighty monks and\n                        at present thirty-five. The monastery is one of the old Bonpo monasteries in\n                        the Chab mdo region. It is a rather large monastery, but over the past six\n                        hundred years, due to grave adversity, both internal and external, it has\n                        been unable to develop itself. It has the look of being very small from\n                        outside. As regards religious objects, it has twenty statues including those\n                        of sTon pa gShen rab, gShen lha &rsquo;od dkar, rNam par rgyal ba and Byams ma, as\n                        well as twenty-odd thangka.

Besides\n                        these, they receive support from households and go out to perform religious\n                        services in villages.</p>\n\n                  "}]}
