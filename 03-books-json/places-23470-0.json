The monastery is a whole day’s ride on horseback from Khra dge.</p><p>The monastery was founded in 1409. Before 1959, there were eighty monks and at present thirty-five. The monastery is one of the old Bonpo monasteries in the Chab mdo region. It is a rather large monastery, but over the past six hundred years, due to grave adversity, both internal and external, it has been unable to develop itself. It has the look of being very small from outside. As regards religious objects, it has twenty statues including those of sTon pa gShen rab, gShen lha ’od dkar, rNam par rgyal ba and Byams ma, as well as twenty-odd thangka. The monks raise, as a source of income, sixty-three <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">’bri</span> and yaks, given by devotees. Besides these, they receive support from households and go out to perform religious services in villages.</p>",
