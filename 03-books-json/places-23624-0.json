I was unable to find\n                        any written Sources concerning the temple&rsquo;s history (and I doubt that any\n                        exist). In Xichang, the capital of Liangshan Prefecture, I met one aged\n                        woman from the village where the temple is located. She told me that\n                        according to a legend the temple was founded in the 13th century. The\n                        devotees of this temple are mainly Mongolians but also include some Tibetans\n                        and Naki, and even some Yi, another ethnic group living in the area. The\n                        Mongolian army, of which the present Mongolians are said to be the\n                        descendants, arrived in the region in the 17th century with Gushri Khan. In\n                        the past, the temple was looked after by the leading Mongolian family, whose\n                        eldest son inherited his father&rsquo;s position as chief, while the second and\n                        third sons became the gnyer ba and head of the temple respectively. When\n                        there were not enough sons, the incumbents were chosen from among the\n                        family&rsquo;s relatives. The temple was rebuilt in the nineteen-eighties.</p>\n\n                  \n\n                  \n\n                     "},{"title":"4.
