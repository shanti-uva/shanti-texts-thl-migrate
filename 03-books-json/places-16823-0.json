The errain is sandy and well drained. Corrals and tent foundations built in the vicinity have heavily impacted the archaeological site. These pastoral structures were probably constructed with stones extracted from the funerary monuments. Fortunately, there are no signs of more recent damage to the site. The site consists of no less than 12 enclosures of various sizes exhibiting single-course, double-course and heaped-stone walls. The funerary structures of <span class=\"popular\">Gakchen<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">\u2019Gag chen<\/span> are made of uncut pieces of variable-length (10 cm to 60 cm long) gray granite.

The entire structure is elevated 50 cm to 1 m above the surrounding terrain. The well-built, double-course walls (50 cm to 70 cm thick) are partly intact. An east-west partition wall bisects the enclosure into two parts. The south cell is 7.6 m in width and the north cell is 4.2 m wide. Against the central portion of the west wall of the enclosure there is a small tumulus, which may be the remains of some kind of interior structure. Two <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma \u1e47i<\/span> plaques rest on this tumulus. Near he northwest corner of FS1 there is an incomplete subsidiary interior enclosure (1.4 m x 2.5 m), whose perimeter walls contain stones embedded in the ground. Loose stones are scattered all around FS1; probably once an integral part of the structure. <\/p>"},{"title":"Funerary Structure FS2","index":9,"parent_index":7,"body":"<p>Funerary structure FS2 (18.3 m 17.5 m) is situated 8 m southeast of FS1. It lies diagonally to FS1 and FS3. This quadrate enclosure is not aligned in the cardinal directions. Parts of all four of its double-course walls (60 cm to 90 cm thick) are intact. FS2 is level with the surrounding terrain or elevated slightly above it. Loose stones obscure much of the structure. In the west corner of the enclosure, walls demarcate a subsidiary interior enclosure (6 m x 7 m). <\/p>"},{"title":"Funerary Structure FS3","index":10,"parent_index":7,"body":"<p>Funerary structure FS3 is situated 10 m east of FS2. FS3 is aligned in the cardinal directions, and measures 11.6 m (north-south) x 6 m (east-west). This structure is elevated about 50 cm above the surrounding terrain, and its double-course perimeter walls are around 50 cm thick. These walls may have been more than one vertical course in height. Rubble is strewn all across the enclosure. On the east side of FS3 there is an attached cell of the same design, which measures 10 m (east-west). Much of the east wall of this ancillary cell is missing. Between FS2 and FS3 there is a large piece of granite (1.6 m long x 50 cm wide) lying on the ground. This flat stone is of the type that is sometimes used for the burial chambers of Upper Tibetan tombs. <\/p>"},{"title":"Funerary Structure FS4","index":11,"parent_index":7,"body":"<p>Funerary structure FS4 (3.6 m x 3.9 m) is situated 2 m east of FS3.
