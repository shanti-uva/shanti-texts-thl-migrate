The resultant ranked hierarchy of traditions are often referred to as \"doxographies,\" literally \"writing of the views.\" These applied to both Buddha-voiced literature presented as oral transcripts of teachings giving by Buddhas (early forms referred to as \"s\u016btras,\" and later forms as part of the esoteric transformation of Buddhism referred to as \"tantras\"), and \"commentarial\" literature understood as compositions by saints who had not yet attained the status of a Buddha. Thus, perhaps the most overarching way of dividing Buddhist traditions is between exoteric and esoteric. This binary division is most frequently expressed either as \"s\u016btra\" and \"tantra\" or as the \"Perfection Vehicle\" (phar phyin theg pa) and the \"Secret Mantra Vehicle\" (gsang sngags theg pa).<\/p>","title":"Introduction to Philosophical Systems in Tibetan Buddhism & B\u00f6n"}]}
