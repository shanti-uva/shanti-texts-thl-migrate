It is constructed of a bluish and reddish volcanic rock. The partially intact east wall of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tenclosure is punctuated by an opening, which is demarcated on either side by a slab placed perpendicular to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twall course. This 90-cm wide opening begins 1.6 m from the southeast corner of the enclosure, thus it is not\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tparticularly well centered. The south &lsquo;portal&rsquo; stone is 60 cm long and projects upwards of 30 cm above ground\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlevel. The north portal stone is 55 cm long and projects around 20 cm above ground level. The opening itself is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdivided into two parts by a smaller transverse stone (30 cm long, 20 cm projection above the surface) set right\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin the middle of it. On either side of the portal there is a large upright slab (around 70 cm long, 10 cm\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tprojection above the surface), which dominate the east wall course. In all probability, the east wall was of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdouble-course composition, but this cannot be confirmed with the structural evidence at hand. The south wall of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe enclosure is mostly intact and indeed has a double-course composition. The south wall is around 50 cm thick\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand is made up of variable-length (10 cm to 60 cm long) stones set in the ground edgewise. These stones are\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tflush with the ground surface or rise above it to a maximum height of 10 cm. The double-course west wall of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tenclosure is now highly fragmentary. The north wall also has been mostly destroyed. Many stones that were once\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tan integral part of the structure now litter the enclosure. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Pillars","index":8,"parent_index":6,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>There are two small pillars standing inside the enclosure.

These two pillars are in very close proximity to one another, 3 m to 3.5 m from the south wall.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThey are, therefore, not well centered between the north and south walls of the enclosure. Their position\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsuggests that other pillars may have once shared the enclosure as well. The gray grained pillars have weathered\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto a reddish color. Some stones have been piled up around the base of the pillars. The north pillar (55 cm\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t[height] x 60 cm [basal girth]) has four irregularly shaped sides. The south pillar (70 cm x 75 cm) is three\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsided. The tips of both pillars have been broken off.
