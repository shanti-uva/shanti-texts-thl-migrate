This tumulus appears to have had double-course walls that ran along the rim of the mound. Smaller stones are strewn all across its surface. Reportedly, many stones were extracted from the structure during the Chinese Cultural Revolution, in order to build retaining walls for an agricultural project. This project, to grow grain, was an abject failure. The fields hat were tilled lie near the tumulus. Just below the northeast side (side facing the valley’s watercourse) of the mound there is an irregularly shaped dark-colored, metamorphic (?) pillar, 40 cm in height. On a higher bench in he vicinity there is a corral, which is said to have been constructed from a ‘<span class=\"popular emph\">mön khang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mon khang</span>’, dismantled for its stones (32° 08.944΄ N. lat. / 82° 44.460΄ E. long.).
