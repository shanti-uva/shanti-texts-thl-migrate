He was a\n                        distinguished master who started on a pilgrimage from sGang ru in Khyung po\n                        and eventually entered the cave Shel brag phug pa, where he practised\n                        meditation. After sitting there for three years, when he reached the age\n                        twenty-five, he built a new private room, kitchen and storehouse at &rsquo;Bum pa\n                        near the cave. In addition, he named the site Shel phug, &ldquo;Crystal Cave&rdquo;, and\n                        stayed there for several more years.</p>\n\n                     <p>When he reached the age of forty-seven, the Mongolian troops of Jungar\n                        invaded the region, inflicted extreme brutalities, and finally killed him by\n                        beheading. They plundered all his properties.</p>\n\n                     <p> In 1747, Rig &rsquo;dzin Zangs skyong dbang po Tshul khrims bstan &rsquo;dzin, the\n                        reincarnation of mKha&rsquo; yag gYung drung ye shes, was born in sTeng chen,\n                        Khyung po dKar ru. From childhood he recognized himself as the reincarnation\n                        and when he reached the age of nine, he left on a journey to sTod in search\n                        of his own monastery. Upon arriving at Shel phug he said, &ldquo;This is my seat&rdquo;,\n                        and he stayed there for thirteen years as a hermit, practising meditation.\n                        He said that it was necessary to build Shel phug Monastery at the very site\n                        where the hermitage lay.</p>\n\n                     <p>Later, at the age of thirty-three, he made a pilgrimage to Kong po Bon ri\n                        and other places. When he came back, after travelling for three years, he\n                        again devoted himself to meditating in the hermitage. He was sixty-eight\n                        when he died.</p>\n\n                     <p>A long time passed before the birth of the next reincarnation took place.\n                        During this period, there was a hermit called Nang do mtshams chen, who was\n                        reincarnation of Li shu. He spent many years practising meditation in the\n                        hermitage. He piously consecrated the place.</p>\n\n                     <p>Then in 1831, the third master in the line of incarnation, bsTan &rsquo;dzin &rsquo;od\n                        zer rgyal mtshan, was born in a family called sDe rnying Nor lha tshang. He\n                        was enthroned as soon as he was recognized as the reincarnation by sNang\n                        ston Zla ba rgyal mtshan (1796-1862). </p>\n\n                     <p>At the age of nineteen, he constructed at the cave a new red-painted\n                        meditation hall, Zhi khro lha khang, kitchen and storehouse. He also renewed\n                        part of the monastic equipment.</p>\n\n                     <p>It was during his time that an agreement was made that this monastery should\n                        be a branch of Ra lag gYung drung gling (No.2) and he devoted his whole life\n                        to meditating on his tutelary dieties in all their aspects and was able to\n                        call upon religious protectors such as Ma, bDud and bTsan. He strongly\n                        advised against making a distinction between the teachings of Buddhism and\n                        Bon. He died at the age of eighty-four.</p>\n\n                     <p>In 1879, the fourth in the line of incarnation, sKal bzang bstan &rsquo;dzin grags\n                        pa, was born in the vicinity of the monastery. He had only his mother when\n                        he decided to go to gYung drung gling in order to be ordained as a monk.\n                        Having done this, he later took full ordination.</p>\n\n                     <p>Then, at Shel phug Monastery, he built an eight-pillared assembly hall with\n                        a complete entrance hall and five rooms upstairs, a meditation hall, another\n                        three-roomed building, a kitchen, a residence for the head of the monastery\n                           (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">bla brang</span>). He spent his whole his life looking\n                        after the monastery. He maintained the doctrine of non-differentiation\n                        between Buddhism and Bon. He lived to the age of eighty years.</p>\n\n                     <p>In 1915, a boy was born to be recognized as the reincarnation. The\n                        recognition was made by Shes rab blo ldan, the 5th abbot of gYung drung\n                        gling, who gave him the name Shes rab bstan &rsquo;dzin rgyal mtshan. He was the\n                        fifth in the line of this monastery, and was enthroned at the age of five.\n                        He built a <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">bla brang</span> and greatly spread the teachings\n                        of Eternal Bon. In 1945, motivated by the prophetical words of sTag lung\n                        sgrol sprul chos sgrol (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">alias </span>sTag lung mkha&rsquo; &rsquo;gro), he\n                        revealed Shel brag as a sacred site. In 1948 he established the ritual\n                        called bDud rtsi bum sgrub, and among the hills behind the monastery he hid\n                        twenty-five sets of treasure bottles of all-wish-fulfilling.</p>\n\n                     <p>On the whole, it was during the days of the dGe slong sKal bzang bstan &rsquo;dzin\n                        grags pa and Shes rab bstan &rsquo;dzin (rgyal mtshan) that the monastery\n                        flourished vigorously.</p>\n\n                     <p>The main religious objects of this monastery in those days were the\n                        life-sized gilt-bronze statues of Buddhas of the three ages and another\n                        two-cubit-high Buddha, a life-sized silver statue of rNam par rgyal ba, a\n                        gilt-bronze statue of Byams pa five cubits tall, a life-sized gilt-bronze\n                        statue of sNang ston Zla ba rgyal mtshan, a cubit-high statue of sGrol ma,\n                        clay images of many kinds, two gilt-bronze reliquary stupas bigger than a\n                        person, eight sets of wooden stupas, many poti of scriptures, and\n                        sixty-seven thangka of the Twelve Rituals (Cho ga bcu gnyis), tutelary\n                        dieties and religious protectors.</p>\n\n                     <p>There were also implements used in making offerings, such as various water\n                        bowls and butter lamp stands made of silver or copper, eight silver vases\n                        and eight complete sets of costumes for religious dances.</p>\n\n                     <p>At that time, this monastery had such treasures as these, and fifty-three\n                        monks under training.</p>\n\n                     \n\n                        "},{"title":"Annual activities and rituals","index":4,"parent_index":3,"body":"\n\n                        <ol type=\"1\">\n                           <li> During the days from the 24th of the twelfth Tibetan month to the\n                              6th of the first month, there were many rituals including the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">dgu gtor</span> rite and the thousand offerings.</li>\n\n                           <li> For more than a month, from the 29th day of the third month to the\n                              8th day of the fifth month, the monks gathered together for prayers. </li>\n\n                           <li> During the whole period from the 29th day of the sixth month to\n                              the end of the seventh month, a summer fast was observed.</li>\n\n                           <li> Assemblies were held for twenty-one days of the eighth\n                              month.</li>\n\n                           <li> Assemblies were customarily held for seven days of the eleventh\n                              month.</li>\n                        </ol>\n\n                        <p>To sum up, 149 days of the year were spent practising the regular\n                           above-mentioned services.</p>\n\n                        <p>This monastery raised a considerable number of livestock, including\n                           according to one record 379 cattle, 698 sheep and 593 goats as a source\n                           of income.</p>\n\n                        <p>At present, the number of monks is twenty-five.

It is 381 kilometres from\n                           dPal mgon rdzong to Nyi ma rdzong and, moreover, it is very difficult to\n                           get through the mud before reaching the highway. To relate our\n                           experience, it was too difficult for us to find our way and we wound up\n                           facing a serious problem: after finding an old, wide road, we proceeded\n                           one kilometre, depending completely on a map, when we found we had lost\n                           our way. We did not know what to do as we were at an empty place without\n                           a single person around, where we could see nothing but the sky above, the\n                           ground below. It was after a good while that we happened to meet a\n                           kind-hearted nomad, who knew the area and was able to help us. Following\n                           his guidance, we went back about ten kilometres eastward, turned to the\n                           left, went another ten kilometres straight north, and finally came upon\n                           the highway from Amdo to mNga&rsquo; ris. After driving eighty kilometres on\n                           the highway, we saw a by way which led us to Nag tshang Nyi ma\n                           rdzong.</p>\n\n                        <p>The highway is good and wide, with many services such as tea houses,\n                           small grocery shops, petrol stations and guesthouses along the way.
