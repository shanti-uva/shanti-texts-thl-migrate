The stable geomorphology of the site and perennial water sources \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpermitted the founding of a large settlement here. To the south and west there is a zone of extensive agricultural \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlands that appears to have lain fallow for centuries. Y&uuml;llung<span class=\"scholar\">Yul lung</span> begins just above the valley floor and extends up a gradually inclined slope for 20 m vertical. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe nucleus of settlement is situated in the southwest sector of the site and is dispersed over 6500m&sup2;, in a dense \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\taggregation of substantial structures. There are also several ruined buildings in the northeast sector of the \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsite. This agrarian settlement potentially supported hundreds of inhabitants. Ironically, not even one permanent \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpastoral camp (<span class=\"popular emph\">G&uuml;nsa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">dgun sa</span>) still exists in the <span class=\"popular\">Sherang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Shes rang</span>&nbsp;valley.</p>\n<p>The residential structures are very much degraded; all that remain are highly fractional walls and footings \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tburied among huge piles of loose rubble. It would appear that the village was made up of large multi-roomed \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbuildings set in a contiguous array. The room spans, wall design and the fact that there are no stone roof members \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tamong the ruins indicate that these edifices were constructed with wooden roofs. Timbers of poplar and willow are \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tavailable in <span class=\"popular\">Rutok</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ru thog</span>, and are plentiful in the \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tadjacent regions of <span class=\"popular\">Ladak</span><span class=\"scholar\">La dwags</span> (Ladakh) and <span class=\"popular\">Khunu</span><span class=\"scholar\">Khu nu</span> (Kinnaur).</p>\n"},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n<p>Local sources refer to Y&uuml;llung<span class=\"scholar\">Yul lung</span> as an ancient \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"popular\">Kel M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Skal mon</span> village.</p>\n"},{"title":"Site elements","index":6,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n"},{"title":"Main village","index":7,"parent_index":6,"body":"\n"},{"title":"Construction traits","index":8,"parent_index":7,"body":"\n<p>The remains of the various edifices of Y&uuml;llung<span class=\"scholar\">Yul lung</span> have 50-cm- to 80-cm-thick random-rubble walls composed of unworked granite. These rounded \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstones required copious amounts of mud-mortar to be applied to the joints. Many of the granite blocks have a \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tyellowish patina and orange climax lichen growing on them, indicating that they have been exposed to the \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\telements for quite awhile. A significant amount of a metamorphic gray stone was also used to build the \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstructures. In places, the rear slope walls were built into the ground to a depth of 1 m. Standing walls still \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcommonly reach 50 cm to 1.2 m in height. In certain structures there are circular pits approximately 1 m in \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdepth.

On the south or lower side of \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthis building there are granite boulders resting on the surface or partially buried, which appear to have been \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tintegrated into it as a cyclopean structure. These boulders are up to 1.4 m in length and 1 m in height. There \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tappears to be another monumental building in the south part of the main village but the melding of its ruins \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twith adjacent structures makes it difficult to gauge its size.</p>\n"},{"title":"Main village shrine","index":10,"parent_index":7,"body":"\n<p>At the southwest corner of the main village there are the vestiges of a shrine complex.

These enclosing walls are 80 cm to 1 m in thickness and up \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto 1 m in height. With the exception of one or two small foundations this enclosure appears to have been \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdevoid of structures. On the south edge of the defunct village there are several modern corrals whose \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconstruction has had little impact on the vast amounts of stone detritus found at the site.</p>\n"},{"title":"North sector","index":12,"parent_index":6,"body":"\n<p>There are the remains of two more important buildings 20 m north or upslope of the large enclosure on the north \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tend of the main village.

Both the east specimen (15.7 m x \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t15 m) and west specimen (15 m x 17 m) have been reduced to fragmentary footings and wall segments.

This broad belt of old farmland extends from above the mouth of the <span class=\"popular\">Sherang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Shes rang</span>&nbsp;valley to the upper extent of Y&uuml;llung<span class=\"scholar\">Yul lung</span>, situated approximately 4 km upstream. The many old fields have been long abandoned as \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tevidenced by a thin layer of gravel that has been deposited over most of them, and the leveling of all the stone \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twalls (<span class=\"popular emph\">Zhingra</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">zhing ra</span>) that once bounded the various plots. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAccording to local tradition, these lands were tilled by the ancient <span class=\"popular\">Kel M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Skal mon</span> people.</p>\n<p>Up valley from Y&uuml;llung<span class=\"scholar\">Yul lung</span> there are no signs of \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tagriculture for a distance of 3 km.
