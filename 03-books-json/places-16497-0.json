Interestingly, there are no ruined a type of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tshrine at the site or in the vicinity, calling into question the cultural orientation of the stronghold.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMoreover, there is no evidence of Buddhist temples at <span class=\"popular\">Chusum Khargok</span><span class=\"scholar\">Chu gsum mkhar gog</span>, such as ochre tinted walls, large open halls with niches for\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstatuary or enclosed galleries.

Be that as it may, the buildings at the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsite were constructed in a fashion similar to those postdating 1000 CE. Also, the ruins seem too well preserved to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbelong to the archaic cultural horizon. These structures have substantial stone foundations and revetments on\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhich lime-tinted adobe blocks were laid. The site exhibits uniform design traits throughout, indicating its\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\testablishment as an integral complex, probably during a single period of time.
