This is an isolated earthen formation unconnected to the badland canyons bounding the north side \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the Pukkhar<span class=\"scholar\">Phug mkhar</span> valley. The location presents \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ta fairly good defensive aspect. Due to extreme degradation and geomorphologic changes, very little structural \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tresidue remains at the site. Around 20 caves used for habitation and other purposes are found in the vicinity of \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Pukkhar<span class=\"scholar\">Phug mkhar</span> formation. Some of these caves \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tare occupied in the winter by the pastoralists of <span class=\"popular\">Bar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bar</span> village. The two structures of the summit complex are the only ones that still rise above ground level at Pukkhar<span class=\"scholar\">Phug mkhar</span>. Below them there is much building \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trubble on broad, almost level slopes. The stretch of the streambed that runs below castle usually has running \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twater, and a small spring is located north of the site at the base of the canyon. A relative abundance of water \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\taccounts for present-day seasonal settlement of the site, and must have been a determining factor in the \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\testablishment of the ancient facility as well. In the valley bottom there is a good stand of tamarisk trees, a \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsource of fuel and building materials. There are no traces of arable land at Pukkhar<span class=\"scholar\">Phug mkhar</span>. However, en route between the village of <span class=\"popular\">Bar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bar</span> and Pukkhar<span class=\"scholar\">Phug mkhar</span>, the large tableland at spu gling chung ma was once intensively \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcultivated. Some farming still takes place here in years with ample rainfall.</p>\n"},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n<p>Local sources report that Pukkhar<span class=\"scholar\">Phug mkhar</span> was an \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tancient <span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span>stronghold.</p>\n"},{"title":"Site elements","index":6,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n"},{"title":"Summit complex","index":7,"parent_index":6,"body":"\n<p>On the summit (no longer accessible) of Pukkhar<span class=\"scholar\">Phug mkhar</span> there is a moderately sized building carcass with parts of three walls intact. It was built \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof sandstone slabs (maximum length: at least 50 cm). The walls of this structure reach no less than 2 m in \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\theight. Approximately 7 m directly below the summit edifice, on the south side of the formation, a highly eroded \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tearthen building (with a few stone courses visible on its south side) has been cleaved in two by the \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdisappearance of a large piece of the parent formation. This structure appears to have been of modest \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tproportions. Roughly 15 m north of the summit a tiny wall fragment still clings to the highly eroded ridge-top. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIt is less than 1 m in length and 50 cm in height (none of which is freestanding). Similarly, approximately 7 m \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbelow the west side of the summit there is a tiny wall remnant. It contains just six sandstone blocks, each 20 \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcm or less in length. This wall fragment is embedded in a steep slope. These two wall traces, as minor as they \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tare, appear to signal that the summit and the areas immediately below it supported a contiguous zone of \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstructures.</p>\n"},{"title":"Shelf and esplanade","index":8,"parent_index":6,"body":"\n<p>Below the summit on the south side of the formation there is a shelf (23 m x around 15 m) that appears to have \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen a building site, but only rubble and possibly a few in situ stones of footings are all that is left. About \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2 m below this shelf there is a sloping esplanade (36 m x 37 m) that also has a fair amount of blue limestone \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand brown sandstone rubble scattered upon it. On the east side of the esplanade along its narrower upper extent \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(situated less than 20 m below the summit) there is the foundation of what appears to have been a significant \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbuilding. However, not one coherent wall fragment has survived. On the south rim of the esplanade, there is the \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbase of a ruined earthen and stone <span class=\"popular emph\">Ch&ouml;rten</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mchod rten</span> (3.5 m x \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3.5 m).<a class=\"note\" name=\"nb66\" href=\"#n66\">66</a> On the east rim there is a single line of stones extending around 1 m, the only coherent wall section \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstill existing on the esplanade. Perhaps defensive works once existed on the low end (south) of the \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tesplanade.</p>\n"},{"title":"Lower slopes","index":9,"parent_index":6,"body":"\n<p>Below the esplanade, steep slopes drop down to the valley floor. A few meters lower than the esplanade, 15 m to \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe northeast, there is a cave on the south side of the formation (3.6 m x 2.3 m). The remains of a fa&ccedil;ade wall \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(4.4 m in length, 40 cm thick, 1.3 m to 2.3 m in height) barricade the mouth of this cave. This mostly \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trandom-rubble wall contains both blocks of limestone and slabs of sandstone. Near its top there are three \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvertical courses of herringbone masonry, each separated by conventional stonework courses. This particular \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstone-working technique appears to have been developed no later than circa 500 CE and continued to find \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\texpression in architectural monuments (residential and ceremonial) of western Tibet until the <span class=\"popular emph\">tenpa chidar</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">bstan pa phyi \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdar</span>.<a class=\"note\" name=\"nb67\" href=\"#n67\">67</a></p>\n"},{"title":"Cave shelters","index":10,"parent_index":6,"body":"\n<p>To the east, across a gully from Pukkhar<span class=\"scholar\">Phug mkhar</span>, \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthree cubic masonry structures were built inside a cave. Their function is not evident. Sockets in a nearby wall \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsuggest that these structures may have helped to support a wooden frame roof. The cubic structures (50 cm to 70 \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcm in height) are made from smaller stone slabs. In the rear wall of the same cave, an L-shaped wall (1.5 m and \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1.1 m in length, 40 cm in height) forms a platform (25 cm to 40 cm in width). The grand aspect of this cave at \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe base of its own formation and the unusual masonry structures inside suggest that it may have been an archaic \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tshrine of some kind.
