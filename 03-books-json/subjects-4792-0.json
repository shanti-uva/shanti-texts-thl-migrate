<ul> <li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">གོམ་པ་བརྒྱབ་ནས་ཡོང་པ་ཡིན། </span>“I came on foot (came walking).”</li> <li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">རྟ་ཞོན་ནས་ཕྱིན་སོང་།</span> “He went by horse (went riding a horse).”</li> <li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">རྟ་རྒྱུག་ནས་མེ་མདའ་བརྒྱབ་དགོས་རེད།</span> “You have to shoot as you gallop.”</li> </ul>
<p>The construction of the present gerundive with ནས་ is ambiguous, insofar as it can also be understood as a past gerundive, implying that the two actions are consecutive. Thus the last example may also be translated as “You have to shoot after you’ve galloped.” Only the context will reveal whether the tense is past or present.</p>
