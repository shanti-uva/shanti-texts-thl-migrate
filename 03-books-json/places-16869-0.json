The northeast-southwest\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\toriented <span class=\"popular\">Khyinak Rong</span><span class=\"scholar\">Khyi nag rong</span> valley is made up of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ta series of benches and gullies, and declines moderately to the southwest. <span class=\"popular\">Khyinak Rong</span><span class=\"scholar\">Khyi nag rong</span> does not enjoy long views in any direction, rather it was\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsited to have a fully sheltered or hidden aspect.

This\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tuniquely designed complex consists of a temple-tomb or mausoleum, an appended enclosure, a series of small\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tquadrate constructions, and other minor structures.

This building measured no less than 6.3 m (northeast-southwest) x 3.1 m (southeast-northwest). It\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tprobably contained two chambers, at least one of which is L-shaped. The edifice has a coursed-rubble fabric and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe thick seams contain copious amounts of a clay- or mud-based mortar. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The forward/southeast wall is 3 m to 4 m in height. Due to the ravages of time, the forward wall now has a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tV-shaped gap in the middle of it. The southwest half of the forward wall was generally built with larger stones\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthan the northeast half. The construction and presentation of the forward wall suggests that is was not too much\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttaller originally than its current height. About 1 m up from the base of the northeast half of the forward wall\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthere are herringbone courses of masonry. Stones and earth are heaped up below the herringbone stonework. This\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tis a distinctive stone working technique found in larger temple-tomb edifices appended to arrays of pillars as\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twell as in some castles. For instance, <span class=\"popular\">Rala Kharmar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ra la mkhar dmar</span> (see A-65) founded by the first Buddhist king of <span class=\"popular\">T&ouml;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Stod</span>, <span class=\"popular\">Nyma G&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Nyi ma mgon</span> (probably\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin the early tenth century CE) exhibits herringbone stonework. The existence of this special style of masonry at\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tboth <span class=\"popular\">Khyinak Rong</span><span class=\"scholar\">Khyi nag rong</span> and <span class=\"popular\">Rala Kharmar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ra la mkhar dmar</span> indicates that it persisted in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Upper Tibetan architectural canon for no less than 450 to 600 years. Here we have an example of a specific\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstone working technique that was carried from the protohistoric period all the way down to the dawn of the great\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBuddhist resurgence in western Tibet. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The southwest wall is 4 m high. At the base of this wall there are either the remains of a small structural\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\textension or a buttress. In the middle of the southwest wall there is a cavity (80 cm x 50 cm x 70 cm [deep]).\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis cavity came about through damage to what may have been a purposely built recess in the structure. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcavity reveals three tamarisk beams (10 cm to 15 cm diameter), which are an integral part of the construction of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe southwest wall. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The southwest half of the temple-tomb is dominated by a narrow (70 cm to 80 cm wide) L-shaped chamber (each of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tits two sides is about 2 m long). This chamber is liable to have had both burial and funerary ritual functions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMost portions of the outer walls surrounding this chamber are 40 cm to 60 thick. The portion of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tforward/southeast wall bounding the inner side of the &lsquo;L&rsquo;, however, is 1.8 m thick. This much thicker wall\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsection significantly adds to the structural integrity of the chamber. There is an opening (20 cm x 25 cm) near\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe top of the southeast end of the southwest wall of the chamber. This opening is supported by a brown\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsandstone lintel, 35 cm in length. There is also an opening (20 cm x 25 cm) in the upper southeast wall of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tchamber, which has a sandstone lintel, 25 cm in length. The deliberate inclusion of apertures in the L-shaped\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tchamber, may suggest that it had habitational functions, perhaps related to the conduct of mortuary rites. These\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\topenings may also have played a role in the desiccation of the interred remains by providing ventilation to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tchamber. The walls surrounding the chamber are up to 2.2 m in height. This demonstrates that the floor of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tchamber was elevated as much as 1.8 m above ground level. The elevation of the chamber may possibly be related\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto eschatological beliefs, concerning the celestial realm, that were held by the builders. Elevated burial\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tchambers are, of course, also characteristic of the mountaintop cubic tombs (II.3) and temple-tombs appended to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tarrays of pillars (II.2c). The narrow nature of the chamber, the massive forward wall buttress and comparative\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tarchitectonic data from other archaic monuments, indicates that <span class=\"popular\">Khyinak Rong</span><span class=\"scholar\">Khyi nag rong</span> may have had an all-stone corbelled roof. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>On the exterior face of the northwest wall there are still traces of clay plaster, illustrating that <span class=\"popular\">Khyinak Rong</span><span class=\"scholar\">Khyi nag rong</span> was not left with raw stone walls.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWe might even consider that this plaster was painted and decorated with mineral pigments, as are some archaic\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thorizon shrines found in sheltered locations and nearly all lamaist facilities of the historic epoch. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Save for the forward wall, the northeast half of the temple-tomb has been reduced to heaps of earth and stone\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trubble. It probably featured an L-shaped or some other type of chamber. Temple-tombs and other archaic funerary\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmonuments of Upper Tibet usually exhibit symmetrical design features.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNevertheless, the difference in the southwest and northwest halves of the forward wall of the edifice may\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsuggest that the chambers were of different designs. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Tho","index":8,"parent_index":6,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>To the northwest of the edifice there is a series of small quadrate masonry structures, which are mostly\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgrouped in two rows. These two rows are oriented southeast-northwest, having the same alignment as the two\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tshorter walls of the temple-tomb. These superficial structures, 19 in number, consist of a layer of stones laid\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tflat on the ground. There are two main types among them: enclosures made up of a single line of stones with open\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinteriors, and stones tightly knit across the breadth and length of the structure. It is possible that they had\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tminimal superstructures made up of several vertical courses of masonry, but there is no extant structural\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tevidence of this feature.
