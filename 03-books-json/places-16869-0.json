The site consists of an integrated necropolitan complex situated on a moderately sloping bench flanked by gullies. The northeast-southwest oriented <span class=\"popular\">Khyinak Rong<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Khyi nag rong<\/span> valley is made up of a series of benches and gullies, and declines moderately to the southwest. <span class=\"popular\">Khyinak Rong<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Khyi nag rong<\/span> does not enjoy long views in any direction, rather it was sited to have a fully sheltered or hidden aspect. The terrain is sandy and strewn with rocks. The necropolis is generally oriented in the intermediate points of the compass, perpendicular to the axis of the bench. This uniquely designed complex consists of a temple-tomb or mausoleum, an appended enclosure, a series of small quadrate constructions, and other minor structures. All structural elements of <span class=\"popular\">Khyinak Rong<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Khyi nag rong<\/span> are built of blue-gray limestone and to a lesser extent of sandstone in various colors. Undressed variable-length (up to 40 cm long) pieces of stones were used in construction. Two samples taken from different load-bearing tamarisk beams embedded in the southwest wall of the emple-tomb have been dated circa the fourth or fifth century CE.<a href=\"#n91\" name=\"nb91\" class=\"note\">91<\/a> <\/p> "},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":" <p>According to residents of <span class=\"popular\">Zhungpa<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Gzhung pa<\/span>, <span class=\"popular\">Khyinak Rong<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Khyi nag rong<\/span> is an ancient monument.<\/p> "},{"title":"Site elements","index":6,"parent_index":2,"body":" "},{"title":"Temple-tomb","index":7,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p>The site is dominated by the shell of an edifice, which probably functioned as a mortuary temple and burial monument. This building measured no less than 6.3 m (northeast-southwest) x 3.1 m (southeast-northwest). It probably contained two chambers, at least one of which is L-shaped. The edifice has a coursed-rubble fabric and he thick seams contain copious amounts of a clay- or mud-based mortar. <\/p> <p>The forward\/southeast wall is 3 m to 4 m in height. Due to the ravages of time, the forward wall now has a V-shaped gap in the middle of it. The southwest half of the forward wall was generally built with larger stones han the northeast half. The construction and presentation of the forward wall suggests that is was not too much aller originally than its current height. About 1 m up from the base of the northeast half of the forward wall here are herringbone courses of masonry. Stones and earth are heaped up below the herringbone stonework. This is a distinctive stone working technique found in larger temple-tomb edifices appended to arrays of pillars as well as in some castles. For instance, <span class=\"popular\">Rala Kharmar<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Ra la mkhar dmar<\/span> (see A-65) founded by the first Buddhist king of <span class=\"popular\">Tö<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Stod<\/span>, <span class=\"popular\">Nyma Gön<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Nyi ma mgon<\/span> (probably in the early tenth century CE) exhibits herringbone stonework. The existence of this special style of masonry at both <span class=\"popular\">Khyinak Rong<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Khyi nag rong<\/span> and <span class=\"popular\">Rala Kharmar<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Ra la mkhar dmar<\/span> indicates that it persisted in he Upper Tibetan architectural canon for no less than 450 to 600 years. Here we have an example of a specific stone working technique that was carried from the protohistoric period all the way down to the dawn of the great Buddhist resurgence in western Tibet. <\/p> <p>The southwest wall is 4 m high. At the base of this wall there are either the remains of a small structural extension or a buttress. In the middle of the southwest wall there is a cavity (80 cm x 50 cm x 70 cm [deep]). This cavity came about through damage to what may have been a purposely built recess in the structure. The cavity reveals three tamarisk beams (10 cm to 15 cm diameter), which are an integral part of the construction of he southwest wall. <\/p> <p>The southwest half of the temple-tomb is dominated by a narrow (70 cm to 80 cm wide) L-shaped chamber (each of its two sides is about 2 m long). This chamber is liable to have had both burial and funerary ritual functions. Most portions of the outer walls surrounding this chamber are 40 cm to 60 thick. The portion of the forward\/southeast wall bounding the inner side of the ‘L’, however, is 1.8 m thick. This much thicker wall section significantly adds to the structural integrity of the chamber. There is an opening (20 cm x 25 cm) near he top of the southeast end of the southwest wall of the chamber. This opening is supported by a brown sandstone lintel, 35 cm in length. There is also an opening (20 cm x 25 cm) in the upper southeast wall of the chamber, which has a sandstone lintel, 25 cm in length. The deliberate inclusion of apertures in the L-shaped chamber, may suggest that it had habitational functions, perhaps related to the conduct of mortuary rites. These openings may also have played a role in the desiccation of the interred remains by providing ventilation to the chamber. The walls surrounding the chamber are up to 2.2 m in height. This demonstrates that the floor of the chamber was elevated as much as 1.8 m above ground level. The elevation of the chamber may possibly be related o eschatological beliefs, concerning the celestial realm, that were held by the builders. Elevated burial chambers are, of course, also characteristic of the mountaintop cubic tombs (II.3) and temple-tombs appended to arrays of pillars (II.2c). The narrow nature of the chamber, the massive forward wall buttress and comparative architectonic data from other archaic monuments, indicates that <span class=\"popular\">Khyinak Rong<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Khyi nag rong<\/span> may have had an all-stone corbelled roof. <\/p> <p>On the exterior face of the northwest wall there are still traces of clay plaster, illustrating that <span class=\"popular\">Khyinak Rong<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Khyi nag rong<\/span> was not left with raw stone walls. We might even consider that this plaster was painted and decorated with mineral pigments, as are some archaic horizon shrines found in sheltered locations and nearly all lamaist facilities of the historic epoch. <\/p> <p>Save for the forward wall, the northeast half of the temple-tomb has been reduced to heaps of earth and stone rubble. It probably featured an L-shaped or some other type of chamber. Temple-tombs and other archaic funerary monuments of Upper Tibet usually exhibit symmetrical design features. Nevertheless, the difference in the southwest and northwest halves of the forward wall of the edifice may suggest that the chambers were of different designs. <\/p> "},{"title":"Tho","index":8,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p>To the northwest of the edifice there is a series of small quadrate masonry structures, which are mostly grouped in two rows. These two rows are oriented southeast-northwest, having the same alignment as the two shorter walls of the temple-tomb. These superficial structures, 19 in number, consist of a layer of stones laid flat on the ground. There are two main types among them: enclosures made up of a single line of stones with open interiors, and stones tightly knit across the breadth and length of the structure. It is possible that they had minimal superstructures made up of several vertical courses of masonry, but there is no extant structural evidence of this feature. The area around the quadrate structures is covered in loose stones, which probably originated from the quadrate structures themselves. The morphological traits of the quadrate structures, their organization in rows and their presence at a funerary site, recalls the <span class=\"popular emph\">to<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">tho<\/span> of he Bon tradition.

The three tamarisk rounds act as internal support for the southwest wall. The removal of a full cross-section from two of the three imbers revealed remarkably intact heartwood (thanks to the frigid, high elevation sterile environment). Tamarisk still grows nearby in the lower shang valley. Given the availability of this species of wood in the locale, the fairly small girth of the members, and the exclusive nature of the site, it seems likely that the tamarisk rounds were specially cut for use in the <span class=\"popular\">Khyinak Rong<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Khyi nag rong<\/span> building project.
