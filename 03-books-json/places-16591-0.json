The north entranceway has been\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tobliterated; it was located in the northern-most room (room 1). The main entranceway (1.5 m x 70 cm) is on the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\teast side of the edifice along the highest elevation section of the forward wall of the structure. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Room 1 (3.6 m x 2 m) of the north suite has no roof left and only fractional walls.

Like rooms in the south suite, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trear or west wall of room 2 is largely composed of an uneven rock face.

Most of the roof over room 2 is missing; its\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfloor-to-ceiling height is around 1.6 m. Room 3 (2.5 m x 2.3 m) shares an internal entrance (1 m x 70 cm) with\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\troom 2. Part of room 3 was walled off to create a separate chamber. None of the roof over room 3 has survived. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Room 4 (2.7 m x 2 m) of the south suite is isolated from room 3; it is accessed via the main entrance and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\troom 5.
