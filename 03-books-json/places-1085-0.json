There is a village called sNya gad<a href=\"#n37\" name=\"nb37\" class=\"note\">37</a> in the valley which is said to have preserved numerous ancient texts\n                        inherited from their ancestors, but unfortunately they were all destroyed\n                        during the Cultural Revolution. Shortly after, Byang Nyi ma rgyal mtshan, a\n                        descendant of Khro tshang in rDza khog brought to the monastery a statue\n                        representing gShen rab Mi bo as a three-year old boy from Central Tibet.
