Blo gros thogs med built a small temple and another for practitioners (sgrub khang) in Brag ra when he sanctified Mount sBa zhabs brag dkar, and named them Khod po Monastery. The place was successively named sNgags sde byang chub gling by Khyung rgod, bDud ’dul yang rtse gling by Nyi ma dbang ldan, and gNas sgo pad ma gling by gSang sngags gling pa (1864-?) when each of these masters visited the monastery. Following is a list of the successive masters of the monastery:</p><ol type=\"1\"> <li>Blo gros rgyal mtshan </li> <li>rNam dag gtsug phud</li> <li>sGrub gshen sNang ldan</li> <li>Nyi ma dbang ldan (who rebuilt a larger assembly hall (’du khang) with twelve columns)</li> <li>rMe nag rTogs ldan </li> <li>rTul ’dre rTogs ldan </li> <li>Go tog rTogs ldan </li> <li>dBra ston Rin chen</li> <li>Khyung gter ’Od zer gling pa </li> <li>Khod spungs dBang ldan (for twenty years) </li> <li>gYung drung dpal bzang (for eighteen years) </li> <li>Thugs rje gling pa (for a few years) </li> <li>gYung drung bstan ’dzin (for three years)</li> <li>bsTan pa rgyal mtshan (for a few years until the Cultural Revolution) </li> </ol><p>The monastery originally comprised of an assembly hall, a kitchen (ja khang), a mchod rten, and a residence for the monks (grwa khang). It had two establishments, one for the ritual cycle of dBal gsas (dbal gsas sgrub grwa) and another for the atonement ritual of the goddess Srid pa rgyal mo (srid rgyal sgrub grwa). It had a giant thangka and a large collection of books including a complete manuscript copy of the Bonpo Kanjur made by Khod po Blo gros thogs med. The monks were required to take their ordination vows at sMan ri Monastery (No.1).</p><p>2) ’Ong gong Monastery was founded by Khod po Blo gros thogs med at lCang log sna.<a href=\"#n34\" name=\"nb34\" class=\"note\">34</a> It started out as a hermitage and gradually expanded into a monastery, but fell into decline owing to an ongoing dispute with Nya mtsho. As a result it was moved to sMug rong dgu rdza brag dkar, but fell into decline again soon after its reconstruction, as two thirds of the monks were converted to Buddhism.</p><p>The remaining monks followed Nyi ma rgyal mtshan, who at that time had returned to ’Dra valley from sMan ri. The site where they settled was called dGe gsar in the local dialect, which probably means dgon gsar, “new monastery”; the ruins of a stupa are still visible. A master of the monastery called A khu Ye shes, rebuilt a ’du khang with four columns and the monastery became known as ’Ong gong.

They were required to go to sMan ri Monastery for three years training and ordination vows.</p><p>3) According to oral tradition, sMong skyid Monastery was founded in the 6th Rab byung (1327-1386) by the three brothers of Khro tshang who travelled from gShen Dar sding Monastery to ’Dra valley in Khams. It was called Glang ’ong. The eldest brother was called gYung drung rgyal mtshan. After a few generations, the monastery was moved to sMong skyid and became known as sMong skyid dgon rnying, the “old sMong skyid Monastery”. Later when it was moved again it was known as both sMong skyid dgon gsar, the “New sMong skyid Monastery”, and Phun tshogs gling. There were forty novices and monks at the monastery. </p><p>In the 1980s, the masters of the three monasteries, sPrul sku Zla ba grags pa, mKhan po bsTan ’dzin nyi ma, mKhan po gYung drung dbang rgyal, mKhan zur ’Chi med, mKhan po Lo thar, Wa lo mGon po and ’Gyur med agreed to rebuild the three monasteries together as one monastery.

Later, during Khri srong lde btsan’s persecution of Bon, sNya chen Bla ma, a Bonpo master and a descendant of sNya chen Li shu stag ring, another great Bonpo master, also escaped to Khams and took refuge in ’Dra where he rebuilt the hermitage which later became the first Bonpo monastic establishment in the area. According to the same legend, he brought a cypress branch from Mount Kongpo Bon ri and planted it in ’Dra valley where it grew into a tree which exists to this day. There is a village called sNya gad<a href=\"#n37\" name=\"nb37\" class=\"note\">37</a> in the valley which is said to have preserved numerous ancient texts inherited from their ancestors, but unfortunately they were all destroyed during the Cultural Revolution. Shortly after, Byang Nyi ma rgyal mtshan, a descendant of Khro tshang in rDza khog brought to the monastery a statue representing gShen rab Mi bo as a three-year old boy from Central Tibet. He also enlarged the monastery. His residence (of which only the ruins remain today) was called Pho nyi bla brang. Later, a master called gTsug phud moved the monastery to its present site<a href=\"#n38\" name=\"nb38\" class=\"note\">38</a> and renamed it Chu mig. According to the same legend, he was a descendant of the sPa tshang family based in Yu ring village, Central Tibet. </p><p>Later, Khod po Blo gros thogs med (1280-1337) arrived in ’Dra valley and unveiled the sacred mountain (gnas ri) of ’Dra gnas the’u bo. Among his foremost disciples there were the Seven Great Lamas. One of the seven was a master from sNya gad village situated near Chu mig Monastery.</p><p>dGe bshes gYung drung bstan ’dzin, the founder of Brag ra Monastery, took Chu mig Monastery under his wing, and thus the two monasteries developed close ties during his lifetime. Hor ra bDud ’dul also came to ’Dra valley and founded Seng ge Monastery. This was the first Buddhist monastery in the area. From the time of Khyung gter ’Od zer gling pa onwards, most masters of his lineage looked after the monastery. Shar rdza bKra shis rgyal mtshan, Bya btang Tshe dbang ’gyur med, dBra ston sKal bzang bstan pa’i rgyal mtshan visited the monastery to give teachings. In the first half of 19th century, A bdud lHun ’grub rdo rje, A lung Blo gros rgyal mtshan, Khyung po Nyi ma rgyal mtshan, O rgyan Thug rje gling pa were the successive masters of the monastery. </p><p>The monastery was razed during the Cultural Revolution and rebuilt in the 1980s under the leadership of Bla ma Nor bu.

According to one legend recorded by ’Phrin dga’<a href=\"#n39\" name=\"nb39\" class=\"note\">39</a> which I also heard when I visited the monastery in 1997, Dam pa rang grol, a Bonpo master from dGe bshes tsa in Rong brag (rGyal rong), came to Ba smad and established a hermitage there in the 3rd Rab byung (1147-1206). The hermitage gradually expanded into a monastery which was named after its founder. </p><p>According to the other legend, a Bonpo master called Rig ’dzin Shar ba rnal ’byor attempted to make a statue of gShen rab Mi bo, but despite his efforts he did not succeed, so in the end he threw out the unfinished statue into the monastery’s courtyard and returned to his room. The next morning, the statue had become a perfect representation of gShen rab Mi bo. It was named sTon pa Rang grub, the “self-manifesting master” and the monastery was named after it. The statue is believed to have survived until the mid-20th century.</p><p>Although there is a list of masters which ’Phrin dga’ claims represents the lineage of the monastery’s masters, it is obvious that there are several names in the list that have nothing to do with the monastery’s history so I did not find it necessary to include it here. The monastery was rebuilt and resumed its religious activities in the 1980s. The last three descendants of Khod po Blo gros thogs med who looked after the monastery are Blo gros, his nephew (khu dbon gdung brgyud), rDo rje, and the latter’s nephew, Nor bu dbang chen (b.1967), who is the present khri pa of the monastery.</p>",
