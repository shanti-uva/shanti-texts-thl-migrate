This structure is sub-rectangular in shape and has a maximum height of 1.8 m. FS1 is made of stone slabs up to 1 m in length laid in random-work courses. The base is topped by a beehive-shaped structure (1.3 m across, 1.1 m in height) with a hollow interior.

Like a nearby corral, this hut, at least in part, appears to have been constructed from stones pilfered from the archaeological site. The design of the stone hut seems to have been inspired by the architecture of mountaintop cubic tombs. On the same outcrop as the hut there appears to be the remains of two masonry bases that belonged to cubic tombs, however, there is no integral stonework in place. <\/p> "},{"title":"Affiliated sites","index":11,"parent_index":2,"body":" "},{"title":"rDe&rsquo;u rgya rug","index":12,"parent_index":11,"body":null}]}
