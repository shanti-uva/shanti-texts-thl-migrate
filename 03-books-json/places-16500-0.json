This site is dominated by a rampart ringing the top of a formation (24 m x 6 m to 7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tm). The facility has expansive views of the sgar valley, and must have been used to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsecretly monitor activities in the valley. Higher ground around it could have been used by an enemy to outflank\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe outpost.

On the exterior side this encircling structure reaches a maximum height of 2.5 m. Built with a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdry-mortar random-rubble fabric, the heavy rampart wall is 1.3 m to 1.5 m thick.

Courses of large stone\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tup to 1.1 m in length filled with smaller stones were used on the exterior face of the rampart.
