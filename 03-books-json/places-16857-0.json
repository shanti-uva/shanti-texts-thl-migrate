While it is certain that <span class=\"popular\">Cheri Teldzong</span><span class=\"scholar\">Phye ri thal rdzong</span>belongs to a different typology than the common cubic tomb of western Tibet, it was placed in this category of sites because of its lofty location and possible mortuary function. Nevertheless, given its general form, it is also possible that his monument represents an archaic cultural shrine of the <span class=\"popular emph\">sekhar</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">gsas mkhar</span> or <span class=\"popular emph\">tenkhar</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rten mkhar</span> class. According to <span class=\"popular\">Runtor</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ru ’thor</span> elders, the environs of <span class=\"popular\">Zhingsa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Zhing sa</span> were cultivated in ancient times. It may be expected then, that shrines for the ritual upkeep of the farming community were established at this locale. </p>",
