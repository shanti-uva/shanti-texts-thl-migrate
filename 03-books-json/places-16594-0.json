This stretch of the g.ya’ bcud valley is endowed with perennial springs and is very isolated. At present it is completely uninhabited. To the west, high ridges hem in the site. Access is from the southeast, a direction in which potential adversaries could be spotted a long way off. <span class=\"popular\">yachüd Drakpuk</span><span class=\"scholar\">G.ya’ bcud brag phug</span> consists of seven southeast-facing all-stone edifices built against cliffs on the left side of the narrow upper valley. The <span class=\"popular emph\">do khang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rdo khang</span> were heavily constructed and possess random-work walls containing variable-sized blocks. The walls tend to be thick (70 cm to 90 cm) and composed of many larger stones (70 cm to 90 cm in length). The wall-joints were mud mortared, most of which has washed away leaving an obdurate lichen-covered residue. Very little of the stone roofs of the structures remain intact. </p>",
