In 1779 A-er-gu Sub-prefecture was eliminated, and the area was incorporated into Meinuo Sub-prefecture, which was under the jurisdiction of Chengmian Longmao Circuit (成绵龙茂道). In 1783 Meinuo Sub-prefecture became Maogong Sub-prefecture in Charge of the Affairs of the Agricultural Garrisons (Military Agricultural Colonies), and Suijing Colony (绥靖屯) and Chonghua Colony (崇化屯) were established in Chuchen.
