This quadrate mound is oriented in the cardinal directions, and measures 5.5 m (east-west) x 6.8 m (north-south). It is elevated 1 m to 1.5 m above the surrounding terrain. On the north rim of the structure a coherent wall fragment 1.7 m in length has endured. This wall contains stones laid flat. Many other stones are embedded on the flanks and rim of FS2, but they no longer form integral structures. The highly eroded top of the mound is sandy and has a little grass growing on it. </p> "},{"title":"Funerary Structure FS3","index":9,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p>Funerary structure FS3 is situated 64 m west of FS2 (20.666΄ / 45.577΄). This enclosure with its superficial double-course perimeter walls is generally aligned in the compass points. The main enclosure measures 11.5 m (east-west) x 19 m (north-south). FS3 has no north wall. The perimeter walls (60 cm to 90 cm thick) contain variable-length (15 cm to 80 cm long) stones that were both laid flat and placed edgewise into the ground. The east and west walls of FS3 follow the axis of the slope and are moderately inclined. Adjacent to the inner side of the east wall, 2.5 m north of the south wall, there is an inner enclosure (4 m x 5 m) of the same type of construction. This structure may possibly mark the location of a burial. The upright stones of the inner enclosure protrude as much as 40 cm above the ground surface. </p> <p>A subsidiary enclosure (5.7 m x 6 m) is situated on the south side of the main enclosure. The link road edges against this sub-rectangular enclosure. Its disintegrated perimeter walls contain both flat and upright stones. On the opposite side of the road from this subsidiary enclosure there appear to be the remains of a smaller but similarly constructed enclosure.</p> "},{"title":"Funerary Structure FS4","index":10,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p>Funerary structure FS4 is situated immediately east of FS3. This enclosure appears to have been aligned in the cardinal directions. FS4 is level with the north/uphill slope and is elevated around 1 m above the south/downhill slope. This enclosure has a south wall (9 m long) and a west wall (7 m long), as well as vestiges of a north wall. None of these walls reveal any coherent stonework. </p>  "}]}
