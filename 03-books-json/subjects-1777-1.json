   "body": "<p class=\"Paragraph\">The dative is used to indicate the grammatical role of <strong>goal</strong>, i.e., the person or thing to which the action is directed, or the owner of something in possessive constructions. This particle corresponds to English “to,” or else is not translated at all. It is also used to form adverbs.</p><ul> <li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ཁོང་གིས་བློ་བཟང་ལ་ཡི་གེ་བཏང་སོང་།</span> “He sent a letter to Lopzang.”</li> <li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ཁོང་ལ་དངུལ་ཡོད་རེད།</span> “He has money.”</li> <li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">གསལ་པོ་</span> “Clear” with the addition of the dative becomes <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">གསལ་པོར་ </span>“clearly”</li> </ul><p class=\"Paragraph\">As in the above example, possessive constructions in Tibetan are formed with the dative:</p><ul> <li>Subject (dative) + Object (absolutive) + Verb. </li> </ul><p class=\"Paragraph\">This structure follows the pattern “to X there is Y,” and may be translated literally as “to him there is money.” It has exactly the same form as constructions of existence. Thus the following sentence may have two meanings:</p><ul> <li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">སློབ་གྲྭ་ལ་དེབ་འདུག</span> “There are books at the school.” Or, “The school has books.” </li> </ul><p class=\"Paragraph\"><em>Note</em>: Be careful not to confuse this construction with the genitive:</p><p><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">སློབ་གྲྭའི་དེབ་འདུག</span> “There are (some of) the school’s books.”</p>",
