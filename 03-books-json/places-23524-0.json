Unfortunately, his trulku passed away in childhood. The following reincarnation was discovered in sTong chung of Ba yan, northern Amdo (Hua long county, Qinghai province). Apparently he did not return to rTse zhig but greatlly contributed to the spread of the Bon religion throughout the Ba yan area, where he became known as sTong chung zhabs drung (<span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">TZLD<\/span> p.6b). The latter\u2019s reincarnation was Zhabs drung bSod nams g-yung drung dbang rgyal (1894-1949), who was very active at the beginning of the 20th century in both the religious and political fields in Amdo. He was a disciple of sBra ser Pandita Kun bzang rgyal mtshan and Bon brgya gYung drung phun tshogs, and in turn became the master of monasteries of rTse zhig, To shes, Shar steng, sKa gsar, Khyung mo, Reb gong Bon mang and the Bonpo community in Cone.
