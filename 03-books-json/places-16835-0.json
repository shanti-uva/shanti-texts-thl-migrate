This largest and best preserved mound is elevated 1.5 m to 2.5 m above the surrounding terrain. The double-course wall that lined the east rim of the mound is still partially intact. This wall (around 80 cm thick) contains uncut variable-length (10 cm to 70 cm long) pieces of light-colored limestone and conglomerate. It is up to 60 cm in height and composed of three layers of stones. Small bits of the same type of wall line the south rim of the structure. There is also a small wall fragment on the north side of FS2. Some stones are partly submerged here and there in the mound, and grass grows on it.<\/p> "},{"title":"Funerary Structure FS3","index":9,"parent_index":6,"body":null}]}
