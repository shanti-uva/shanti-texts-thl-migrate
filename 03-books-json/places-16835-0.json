This largest and best preserved mound is elevated 1.5 m to 2.5 m above the surrounding terrain. The double-course wall that lined the east rim of the mound is still partially intact. This wall (around 80 cm thick) contains uncut variable-length (10 cm to 70 cm long) pieces of light-colored limestone and conglomerate. It is up to 60 cm in height and composed of three layers of stones. Small bits of the same type of wall line the south rim of the structure. There is also a small wall fragment on the north side of FS2. Some stones are partly submerged here and there in the mound, and grass grows on it.</p> "},{"title":"Funerary Structure FS3","index":9,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p>Funerary structure FS3 (5 m x 3 m) is situated 120 m west of FS2 at slightly lower elevation.

A few stones that were part and parcel of the walls bounding the top of the structure are still in situ. Another possible funerary mound is found some tens of meters northwest of FS3, but the structural evidence is inconclusive. This possible specimen is located closer to the <span class=\"popular\">Somé Tsangpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bso med gtsang po</span> on rolling sandy ground, which is elevated about 20 m above the river.</p>  "}]}
