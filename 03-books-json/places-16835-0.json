Some sections of walls, two vertical courses of stones in \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\theight, have persisted just below the top of the structure.

The double-course wall that lined the east rim of the \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmound is still partially intact. This wall (around 80 cm thick) contains uncut variable-length (10 cm to 70 cm \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlong) pieces of light-colored limestone and conglomerate. It is up to 60 cm in height and composed of three \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlayers of stones. Small bits of the same type of wall line the south rim of the structure. There is also a small \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twall fragment on the north side of FS2.
