It consisted of four or five residential edifices that have\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tundergone much anthropogenic degradation (as indicated by the lack of roof members on the site, the destruction of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trevetments and Buddhist reconstruction at the site). No least of all, this tampering was\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trelated to an effort to Buddhicize the site. However, there are no signs of a permanent\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBuddhist presence on the island. Perhaps the archaic religious aura of <span class=\"popular\">Doser</span><span class=\"scholar\">Do ser</span> was too strong for Buddhist\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcolonists. Moreover, the geomantic perfection of <span class=\"popular\">Doser</span><span class=\"scholar\">Do ser</span> was not such an attraction in Buddhism with its stress on mental operations\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trather than on environmental dimensions. Perhaps due to its proximity to <span class=\"popular\">Tis&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ti se</span> and <span class=\"popular\">Mapam Yutso</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ma pham g.yu mtsho</span>, vital Buddhist pilgrimage sites, the buildings of <span class=\"popular\">Doser</span><span class=\"scholar\">Do ser</span> were the focus of especially harsh treatment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLikewise, the archaic structures at <span class=\"popular\">Semodo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Se mo do</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(B-126, B-127) in <span class=\"popular\">Namtso</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gnam mtsho</span> also appear to have\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen the victims of extreme vandalism. <span class=\"popular\">Doser</span><span class=\"scholar\">Do ser</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnever had the economic and cultural significance of <span class=\"popular\">Tis&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ti se</span> with its more than 60 <span class=\"popular emph\">do khang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rdo khang</span> spread\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tout over nine sites (A-46, B-9, B-10, B-20, B-21, B-22, B-33, B-41, and B-42). This may be yet another reason why\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBuddhist reoccupation of the site appears to have been marginal.

With so little of the original structures to go by the ground\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tplan of RS1 is unclear.

Many other pieces of the roof must have been carried off. Some original wall footings\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twere incorporated into the west side of this enclosure. Such enclosures were used as rudimentary shelters by man\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand beast. The west end of the RS1 dispersion consists of highly degraded footings divided into two sections\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(the two rooms of a building?), covering an area of 6 m x 3.7 m. It is in the center of the RS1 dispersion that\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\toriginal wall segments are the most developed. These probably represent the remains of two or three rooms (5.3 m\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tx 5 m). The west end of the central sector of the dispersion is dominated by the remains of a rectangular\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstructure, which is generally aligned in the cardinal directions. This adobe wall fragment is encased in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trandom-work masonry walls and measures 3 m (east-west) x 4.5 m (north-south) x 1.8 m maximum height. The mud\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbricks used in construction are now highly eroded. The precise architectural character of this composite\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstructure is not clear but almost certainly it was a shrine of some kind. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The north end of the RS1 dispersion is dominated by a wall 8 m in length, made from stones extracted from the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tancient residences. On this wall there are around 70 highly eroded inscribed plaques. The physical condition of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthese plaques (highly worn, heavily repatinated, friable state of the stone) indicates that they are of great\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tage. It seems likely that most or all of these plaques were produced in the <span class=\"popular emph\">tenpa chidar</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">bstan pa phyi dar</span>. Their production may have been an act of purifying the location\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom archaic cultural influences, thereby claiming <span class=\"popular\">Doser</span><span class=\"scholar\">Do ser</span> for the Buddhists. All but one of the plaques was carved with <span class=\"popular emph\">Wuchen</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">dbu can</span> lettering. The other plaque has <span class=\"popular emph\">lentsa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">lan tsha</span> script. The six-syllable <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma &#7751;i</span> mantra is by far the most common inscription but there are also a few plaques bearing\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe <span class=\"emph\">vajra</span> and <span class=\"popular\">Riksum G&ouml;npo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rigs gsum mgon po</span> mantras.
