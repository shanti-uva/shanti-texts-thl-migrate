With its many salt and soda flats, this was an attractive location for the placement of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tritual and utilitarian facilities pertaining to the disposal of human remains. I refer to this area as the &lsquo;Valley\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the Dead&rsquo; because of the concentration of funerary sites found here (see C-92, C-153, D-46, D-68). All of these\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsites have especially long views in the east. The extreme aridity of the area, rendering much of it uninhabitable\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand of little value to livestock, would appear to account for the concentration of funerary sites in the Valley of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Dead.
