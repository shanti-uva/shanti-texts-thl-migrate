This lower site is much less protected and more open than that of the castle. The edifices were built in the ordinary fashion of all-stone corbelled edifices. They have robust random-rubble walls that were either constructed with a minimum of mud-mortar or with no mortar at all. Mostly slabs of variable length (20 cm to 1 m long) were used to build the structures.

This edifice is divided into four main sections and contained around seven rooms. The stone roof of the northeast room is partly intact and has in situ bridging stones up to 1.9 m in length. The floor-to-ceiling height of the northeast room is about 1.7 m. There are two niches in its north wall.
