This orientation is at odds with most other sites of this typology, which generally have the most expansive vistas in the east. The very slightly sloping errain is sandy with a sparse covering of turf. There are two main pillars firmly planted near the inner edge of he west wall of the enclosure. <\/p> "},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":null},{"title":"Site elements","index":6,"parent_index":2,"body":" "},{"title":"Enclosure","index":7,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p>The enclosure is aligned in the cardinal directions, and measures 8.8 m (east-west) x 7 m (north-south). Significant parts of all four walls of the enclosure are intact. As in most examples of the typology, these double-course walls (around 70 cm thick) consist of a single layer of stones embedded in the ground. The stones (up to 50 cm long) of the enclosing walls are flush with the surrounding terrain or elevated above it to a maximum height of 15 cm.<\/p> "},{"title":"Pillars","index":8,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p>Both of the main pillars are partially covered in orange climax lichen. The north pillar is four-sided, beige in color and fairly well centered in the enclosure (1 m [height] x 1.4 m [basal girth]). This pillar is slightly inclined. North of the north pillar there is a tiny specimen around 20 cm in height. The south pillar is hree-sided and tan in color (85 cm x 1 m). <\/p>  "}]}
