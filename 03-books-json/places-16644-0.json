Significant parts of all four walls of the enclosure are intact. As in most examples of the typology, these double-course walls (around 70 cm thick) consist of a single layer of stones embedded in the ground. The stones (up to 50 cm long) of the enclosing walls are flush with the surrounding terrain or elevated above it to a maximum height of 15 cm.</p> "},{"title":"Pillars","index":8,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p>Both of the main pillars are partially covered in orange climax lichen. The north pillar is four-sided, beige in color and fairly well centered in the enclosure (1 m [height] x 1.4 m [basal girth]). This pillar is slightly inclined. North of the north pillar there is a tiny specimen around 20 cm in height. The south pillar is three-sided and tan in color (85 cm x 1 m). </p>  "}]}
