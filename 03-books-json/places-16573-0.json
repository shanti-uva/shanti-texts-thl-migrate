The important <span class=\"popular\">Gugé<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ge<\/span> agricultural enclave of <span class=\"popular\">Shangtsé<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Shang rtse<\/span> still boasts a relatively high volume perennial stream. On the op of the formation there is a rammed-earth and adobe block carcass (approximately 14 m x 8 m), which faces southeast towards the <span class=\"popular\">Shangtsé<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Shang rtse<\/span> valley. The severe gradient of the slope suggests that this single edifice was split between three different elevations. Most of the structure, however, has disappeared down the slopes. <span class=\"popular\">Shangtsé Bön Khar<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Shang rtse bon mkhar<\/span> commands an excellent position over the north side of the broad <span class=\"popular\">Shangtsé<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Shang rtse<\/span> valley, supporting its stronghold attribution in the oral tradition. Arrayed below the summit are 12 to 15 shallow caves that were once inhabited. The scant structural evidence remaining is insufficient to positively identify <span class=\"popular\">Shangtsé Bön Khar<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Shang rtse bon mkhar<\/span> as an archaic facility. <\/p> "},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":" <p>According to <span class=\"popular\">Shangtsé<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Shang rtse<\/span> township elders, <span class=\"popular\">Shangtsé Bön Khar<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Shang rtse bon mkhar<\/span> was an ancient Bon castle.

The uppermost portion of the outer wall of the structure (the bulk of what still exists) appears to be primarily composed of rammed-earth. The orifices for the shuttering pins are regularly distributed across this wall segment (maximum height: 2.5m). Each orifice has a small stone header. There are also a few unbaked mud-brick wall fragments that formed interior wall partitions, but they are too heavily degraded to yield information on the ground plan of the facility.
