The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsevere gradient of the slope suggests that this single edifice was split between three different elevations.

The uppermost portion of the outer wall of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstructure (the bulk of what still exists) appears to be primarily composed of rammed-earth. The orifices for the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tshuttering pins are regularly distributed across this wall segment (maximum height: 2.5m). Each orifice has a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsmall stone header.
