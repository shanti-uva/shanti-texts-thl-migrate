The mesa-like formation on which it\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\treposes is only a distance of approximately 200 m from <span class=\"popular\">Lung Puk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Lung phug</span>.

Access to the summit is by way of the southwest face. Cobble footings are in evidence along the route to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe summit. The axis of the summit runs northeast-southwest and is 64 m in length. This flat summit is 6 m to 12 m\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin width. Much of it has been excavated to a depth of 1.5 m to 2.5 m to create a warren of small semi-subterranean\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trooms. Walls were constructed above the rim of the summit. They now reach a maximum height of 80 cm. These walls\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tare primarily composed of natural earthen slabs that must have been extracted from the excavated rooms. There is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tno indication of what type of roofs these structures had. This site exhibits one of the only examples of rooms\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcreated from open excavations surveyed to date.

The shearing\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the formation and the network of rooms sheltered within is plainly visible. Some of the rooms sunk into the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsummit are interconnected while others are not. In the central portion of the east rim of the summit there is a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdefensive wall segment (6.5 m long, a maximum of 1 m high and 50 cm thick). It is made from granite cobbles and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnatural earthen blocks. Presumably, the entire summit was hemmed in by a parapet wall but only scant evidence\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tremains. This includes the remainder of a defensive wall around the north rim of the summit. None of it,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thowever, is still freestanding. Some of the west side of the summit was not excavated. Instead, it has various\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t40-cm thick double-coursed cobble wall-footings affixed to it. The longest of these wall segments is 8.9 m.
