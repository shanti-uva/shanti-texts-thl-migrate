The stronghold (10.8 m x 5.8 m) was\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbuilt at two levels. In most places it has been reduced to its revetments and footings. The maximum height of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe revetments is 2 m. The higher south tier is separated from the north tier by a 1.5 m vertical rise. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tingression is in the north, between walls inset 2 m into the structure, creating an inlet. This design feature\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tis reminiscent of the entryways of <span class=\"popular\">Ha La Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ha la mkhar</span> West (A-58) and <span class=\"popular\">Naktsuk Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Nag gtsug mkhar</span> (A-57), in <span class=\"popular\">Gug&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ge</span>. The outer\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\topening of this inlet is 1.8 m in width and the inner access is 90 cm across. The vertical distance between the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\touter and inner thresholds of the ingress is 1.5 m, thus stairs must have been built to span this height. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\theavy walls of the inlet rise to an elevation of 2 m. The entry between the two levels of the building is in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twest and is set in an interclose, 1.8 m in length. An 80-cm long threshold stone stretches across this entrance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMost of the mud-mortar has washed out of the random-rubble walls. A bluish metamorphic stone, which has\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tweathered to a brown color, was used in construction. These roughly dressed stones are primarily 20 cm to 70 cm\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin length, and the walls are around 50 cm in thickness. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n"}]}
