FS1 constitutes a distinctively designed funerary structure. Its surface is completely covered in stones embedded in the ground. The upright stones of the single-course rectangular perimeter walls project as much as 30 cm to 40 cm above the ground surface. The four walls of FS1 are generally aligned in the cardinal directions. The entire structure is elevated around 50 cm above the surrounding terrain. A cairn was recently raised on one corner of FS1.</p>",
