Its\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfour double-course walls (60 cm to 85 cm thick) are largely intact. The enclosure is primarily made up of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvariable-length (20 cm to 50 cm long) unshaped chunks of blue limestone; however, red sandstone, a beige rock,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand a gray rock were also used. Most of these stones were laid flat. The north and south walls of the enclosure\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tare mostly level with the ground surface. The east wall is elevated about 20 cm above ground level and now\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbuckles outwards. In the middle of the east wall there is a gap, which appears to have been caused by damage to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe structure. Near the north end of the east wall two or three vertical courses of masonry are exposed. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\teast side of the north wall terminates in a slab, 60 cm long, which was planted in the ground edgewise. The west\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twall is elevated about 30 cm above the interior of the enclosure. The elevated east side and sunken west side of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe enclosure serve to create a level interior space. There are pieces of milky quartz scattered about the site;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthese must have functioned as offerings or as a decorative element. There are quite a few stones scattered\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\taround the enclosure and the adjoining areas; some of these may have been part of the structure. This disjecta\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmembra suggests that the walls of the enclosure were much better developed than they appear today. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Pillars","index":8,"parent_index":6,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>There are eight firmly planted unbroken pillars that stand 70 cm to 90 cm from the inner edge of the west wall\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the enclosure.
