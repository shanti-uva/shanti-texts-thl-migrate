The main edifice of the site is still about 5 m tall, and it is planted\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ton top of a rock outcrop, adding another 10 m to 15 m to its elevation. This structure appears to have consisted\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof three stories, the tallest all-stone edifice documented to date in Upper\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTibet. The walls of the tower taper slightly inward, in the manner of traditional Central Tibetan\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmonumental architecture.

The random-work courses were mud mortared but much of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tadhesive has washed out from the walls. What mortar remains is heavily impacted and covered in lichen.

The two walls of the cut-away section measure 1.5 m x 1.6 m. The current maximum exterior\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\televation of the structure is approximately 5 m, but in order to accommodate a roof it was at least marginally\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttaller. The ingression is in the south, the indented side of the edifice. The integral portal has a height of 1m\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand a width of 80 cm. It accesses a vestibule that runs the entire north-south length of the structure. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tall-stone corbelled roof over the vestibule is still fully intact. On its rear west side there is access to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsecond floor, which is set 1.2 m higher. This level is divided into two rooms by a 75-cm thick partition wall.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTwo stone floor joists, more than 1.5 m in length, are still in place. In the south room some of the corbels are\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin situ as well. Directly below these two rooms there may have been a basement but, if so, it has either\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcollapsed or been sealed off by rubble. The vestibule also accesses an upper room directly above it, which\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tappears to have constituted part of the third level of the tower. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Outlying structures","index":8,"parent_index":6,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Below the entrance, at the southeast base of the outcrop, are the remains of another all-stone habitational\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstructure.
