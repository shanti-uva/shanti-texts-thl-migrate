From the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">rdzong</span>, the monastery is reached by\n                        driving twenty kilometres eastward on the highway and then riding south for\n                        six hours on horseback.</p>\n\n                     <p>This monastery was founded in 1256. Before 1959, there were only four monks,\n                        but at present there are twenty. It is counted as one of the oldest Bonpo\n                        monasteries in Chab mdo region, but has not shown much development because\n                        of the lack of transport facilities and because of other unfavourable\n                        conditions. Currently it has an assembly hall, a temple, monks&rsquo; quarters and\n                        other buildings, and is fairly well equipped with religious objects such as\n                        statues of sTon pa gShen rab, Dran pa nam mkha&rsquo;, his son Tshe dbang rig\n                        &rsquo;dzin, rNam par rgyal ba, sTag la me &rsquo;bar, mNyam med Shes rab rgyal mtshan\n                        and Srid pa rgyal mo, as well as several thangka and Bon scriptures.</p>\n\n                     <p>Rituals and services of this monastery are much the same as those of other\n                        Bonpo monasteries of this region. It does not have any special\n                        activities.</p>\n\n                     <p>As the monastery itself has no means of providing a living for the monks,\n                        they depend on their own parents and relatives for support.</p>\n\n                  "}]}
