Here there are revetments up to 90 cm in height. On the rest of the summit there are only fractional wall footings left. From the north side of the summit, a ledge runs along the east face of the formation gradually descending for 3 m in a southerly direction parallel to the breadth of the summit. On its north side this ledge is 2 m wide and on its south side 5.5 m wide. Along its outer edge are partial footings of what must have been a defensive wall. In three places this ledge is revetted. The largest revetment section is 4 m in length and 3 m in width, and was made from dry-mortar random-rubble slabs. On the south edge of the ledge are two small areas with structural detritus. Approximately 12 m below the north side of the summit is a spur, measuring 22 m (north-south) x 8 m (east-west), with many highly dissolute wall footings. <\/p> <hr class=\"footnote-divider\" \/> "},{"title":"Notes","index":8,"parent_index":0,"body":" <div class=\"footnote\"> <a name=\"n38\" \/> <a href=\"#nb38\" class=\"note\"> [38] <\/a> This is one local interpretation of the etymology of the site name. <\/div>  "}]}
