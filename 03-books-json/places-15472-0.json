The community is located in close proximity to different ethnic groups, diverse religious traditions, and powerful civilizations. <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15472\">Labrang<\/span>'s prominence is all the more visible because of this proximity, and this proximity to other cultures was perhaps a factor in the monastery's rise to prominence in Tibet, and its assertion of its cultural identity, its religious heritages, and its unique <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15348\">Amdo<\/span> highlands culture.<\/p><p>It is located on the northeastern corner of the Tibetan Plateau in the region now called <span class=\"place\" title=\"F1147\">Sangchu<\/span> (<span class=\"place\" title=\"F1147\"><em>bsang chu<\/em><\/span>) County, or in Chinese, Xiahe County. Politically, <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15472\">Labrang<\/span>'s territories are in Tibet's <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15348\">Amdo<\/span>, but its lands were claimed by Gushri Khan (1582-1655) and the Khoshud Mongols in the sixteenth century. <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15472\">Labrang<\/span> is also located in China's Gansu Province, claimed by the Qing Dynasty, and in later years by the Nationalist and Communist governments.<\/p><p>The <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15472\">Labrang<\/span> region is primarily populated by ethnic Tibetan nomads. Eleven Mongol \"arrows\" or tribes under the jurisdiction of Erdeni Jinong (d. 1735) and his successors live in nearby Qinghai, with representative Mongol groups in the immediate vicinity of <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15472\">Labrang<\/span>. Mongol monks and lamas maintained a strong presence at <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15472\">Labrang<\/span> and in the region throughout the history of the monastery. The surrounding regions outside of the core <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15472\">Labrang<\/span> territory are populated by groups of Hui and Salar Muslims, and Han Chinese communities. Other groups with mixed Tibetan, Mongol, Muslim, and Chinese influences evolved over time, but primarily in regions on the peripheries of <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15472\">Labrang<\/span>'s territories. In general, though it maintained its distinctive Tibetan character, the region grew more integrated over time because of increases of trade, military violence, and political diplomacy.<\/p>"},{"title":"History","index":2,"parent_index":0,"body":"<p><span class=\"place\" title=\"F15472\">Labrang<\/span> Monastery was formally founded in 1709, on the three hundredth anniversary of the founding of <span class=\"place\" title=\"F16954\">Ganden<\/span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"F16954\">dga' ldan<\/span><\/em>) Monastery in central Tibet.

The <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Jamyang Zhepa<\/span>'s central Tibetan <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Gelukpa<\/span> political and academic background served as a model for many of <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15472\">Labrang<\/span>'s key figures.

The six colleges at <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15472\">Labrang<\/span> followed the text studies, debate, and esoteric ritual sequences observed in <span class=\"place\" title=\"F637\">Lhasa<\/span>, especially those at <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Gomang<\/span> College. The first of the six colleges at <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15472\">Labrang<\/span> was <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">T\u00f6sam Ling<\/span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">thos bsam gling<\/span><\/em>, 1711), the largest college, with specialties in Tibetan Buddhist philosophy, ethics, epistemology, and literature. The second college, like the first founded by the First <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Jamyang Zhepa<\/span>, is the Lower Tantric College (<span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Gyum\u00e9<\/span>, <em><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">rgyud smad,\u00a0<\/span><\/em>1716). By 1738 these two colleges housed over one thousand monks, and in evidence of the <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Jamyang Zhepas<\/span>' commitment to scholarship, the monastery had the beginnings of its massive library collection, which at its peak grew to over 200,000 volumes. The <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Gelukpa<\/span> focus on philosophy and tantric Buddhism is reflected in the first two colleges founded by the First <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Jamyang Zhepa<\/span>, and the <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Gelukpa<\/span> focus on K\u0101lachakra studies appeared at <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15472\">Labrang<\/span> with the construction of the K\u0101lachakra College, built in 1763 by the Second <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Jamyang Zhepa<\/span> (1728-1791). The fourth college at <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15472\">Labrang<\/span>, the Medical College, was founded in 1784 by the Second <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Jamyang Zhepa<\/span>. To this day the Medical College is famous for its commitments to scholarship and medical service. The fifth college is the Hevajra College, founded in 1879 by the Fourth <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Jamyang Zhepa<\/span> (1856-1916), said to be modeled on <span class=\"place\" title=\"F637\">Lhasa<\/span>'s <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Namgyel (rnam rgyal)\u00a0<\/span>Monastery. The Fifth <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Jamyang Zhepa<\/span> (1916-1947) founded the Upper Tantric College (<span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Gyut\u00f6<\/span>, <em><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">rgyud stod<\/span><\/em>), the sixth college at <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15472\">Labrang<\/span>. In addition to these six colleges, <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15472\">Labrang<\/span> soon was home to an enormous complex of temples, stupas, shrines, lamas' residences, and monastic housing. The monastery's population fluctuated, but was easily able to house over three thousand monks.<\/p><p><span class=\"place\" title=\"F15472\">Labrang<\/span>'s religious heritage is primarily <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Gelukpa<\/span>, but the monastery authorities have a well deserved reputation for religious tolerance. The <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15472\">Labrang<\/span> authorities tolerated and eventually supported the construction of a <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Nakpa<\/span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">sngags pa<\/span><\/em>) College immediately outside of the monastery walls. The monastery supported first one, then a second and at this writing three nunneries. <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Nyingma<\/span> (<em><span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">rnying ma<\/span><\/em>) and <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">B\u00f6n<\/span> (<em><span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">bon<\/span><\/em>) practitioners are active in the greater community, and in time the <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15472\">Labrang<\/span> authorities allowed a Muslim mosque, a hybrid Tibetan-Chinese Amye Machen\/Guandi Temple, and a Christian mission, all on its estate lands.<\/p><p>In addition to its most famous individuals, its \"six colleges,\" its scores of buildings, its art treasures, library, and powerful regional heritage, the <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15472\">Labrang<\/span> community describes itself in its own terms. Its primary revenue and corv\u00e9e generating properties are called the \"Eight Divine Communities,\" accumulated over the history of the community, all with compelling stories and rich cultural heritage. The \"Eighteen Estates\" are the estates of the primary <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15472\">Labrang<\/span> lineages of reborn lamas.

The \"Four Golden Throne Holders\" are four great <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15472\">Labrang<\/span> lamas who are recognized for their status at <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15472\">Labrang<\/span>, and for three of them, the Lhasa post of \"Ganden Throne Holder.\" The \"Eight Kenpos\" are eight prominent abbots of exceptional influence in <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15472\">Labrang<\/span>'s history.
