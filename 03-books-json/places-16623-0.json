It consists of an undulating rocky zone (47 m x 48 m). The identity and relative chronology of the site is unclear. It would appear to have once been a significant area of habitation. The stones of what seem to have been one contiguous complex are embedded in the ground across the site. This contrasts with adjoining areas which are free from stones. There appears to have been outer walls at <span class=\"popular\">Tokmé Deu Bur</span><span class=\"scholar\">Thogs med rde’u ’bur</span> that are roughly aligned in he cardinal directions. A small contemporary irrigation ditch cuts through the west side of the site. It is flanked by small fields, some of which are being cultivated. The barley and peas grown here are used as animal fodder. </p>",

Near the upper end of the west side of <span class=\"popular\">Tokmé Deu Bur</span><span class=\"scholar\">Thogs med rde’u ’bur</span> informal excavations up to 1 m in depth have been carried out.

In he east there are several small foundations (?), now nothing more than depressions ringed with stones. Along the upper eastern fringe of the site (slightly elevated above the outlying terrain) there is a partly coherent footing 4 m in length aligned north-south. Impacted structural traces on the upper/north edge of the site reach 2 m in height.
