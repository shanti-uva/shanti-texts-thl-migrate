   "body": "<p>\"Streethouse\" is used as a particular building type within the <em>Lhasa Atlas</em> by Knud Larsen and Amund Sinding-Larsen. In the \"Historical buildings in Lhasa\" table at the back of the book (pp. 165-172), buildings of the \"Streethouse\" type are designated with the letter \"H\" in the building type column. In the THL Place Dictionary, when a building has this feature type and the <em>Lhasa Atlas</em> is given as the source, it means that the building was designated with a \"H\" in the <em>Lhasa Atlas</em> table.<br><br>This building type is described as follows:<br><br>\"<em>H. Streethouse</em>. Example: Shamo Karpo (7).<br><br>\"This term describes a hybrid of the townhouse when the site is too restricted to allow for a courtyard. The streethouse is lit only from the street, and is often located on corners to increase the number of windows. Adjoining buildings behind it allow little space for the normal facilities of an independent building, and therefore the streethouse normally lacks its own latrine-tower. The streethouse type most likely developed as the town grew denser and as more marginal sites were used for commercial and residential construction. The streethouse always has shops on the ground floor.\" (p. 61).<br><br>Source:<br><br>Larsen, Knud and Amund Sinding-Larsen. <em>The Lhasa Atlas: Traditional Tibetan Architecture and Townscape</em>.
