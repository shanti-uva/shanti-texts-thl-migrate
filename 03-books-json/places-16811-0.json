The site enjoys broad views to the north and east. <span class=\"popular\">Neri B&uuml;ltso</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ne ri bul mtsho</span> is visible 15 km to the east. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tseven terraced funerary structures of the site sit on a turf-blanketed, moderately inclined slope. These\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstructures are generally aligned in the cardinal directions. Funerary structures FS2 to FS6 are devoid of stone\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twalls and there is little stone detritus remaining on them. It would appear, therefore, that external stone walls\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twere only minimally used at <span class=\"popular\">Zhunm&eacute; Do</span><span class=\"scholar\">Zhun ma&rsquo;i mdo</span>.
