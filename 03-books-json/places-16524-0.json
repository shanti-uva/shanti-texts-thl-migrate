This is the general\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdirection from which early invaders came, according to the western Tibetan oral tradition. The upper site is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tenclosed by two rocky ribs, offering some protection from the brunt of the elements. On the east rib there is a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsingle structure (6 m x 4 m) with mud-mortared random-work walls (50 cm thick). Variable-sized pieces of granite\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tup to 1 m in length went into its construction. The most likely identity of this east rib structure is a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfortified habitation. It is set on a crag that is just wide enough to accommodate its breadth. Access is via a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnarrow ledge along a steep rock face. Approximately 30 m higher, on the summit of the formation, there are one\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tor two similar structures (they were not visited during the survey). These summit structures appear to be the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tremains of lookout posts. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Between the two rocky ribs, beginning at the same elevation as the east rib structure, there are a series of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tparallel walls that seemed to have extended across the breadth of a steep slope. These walls linked both rocky\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tribs into an integral defensive complex. These breastworks are all in a state of advanced decay, therefore,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir dimensions and configurations are not very clear. The highest wall is nothing more than a fragment several\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmeters in length. A few meters below it is the longest extant wall section. It begins at the west rib and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttraverses 18 m of the slope. Tiny traces of the wall continue eastwards, suggesting that it ran to the east rib.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf so, its original length was around 50 m. On the downhill side this rampart is as much as 1.8 m in height,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhile on the uphill side it is generally level with the slope. This dry-mortar random-rubble granite wall\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcontains stones up to 1 m in length. Just 60 cm below this structure there is another wall segment that starts\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tat the west rib and traverses the slope for 10 m. Downhill, at a distance of 2 m, there is another small wall\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsection. About 90 m further downhill are minute fragments of other defensive walls. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Lower terraces","index":8,"parent_index":6,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Below the network of walls circumscribing the upper slope, there are a series of terraces that envelop the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnorth and east sides of the formation, in a swathe around 100 m wide. These terraces blanket an area of roughly\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t10,000 m&sup2;, and occupy gentle boulder-strewn slopes that sweep down to the valley floor. The last terraces are\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsituated 20 m vertical above the valley bottom. Only wall footings have survived, so the nature and extent of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthese structures is not readily apparent. There are some double-course wall footings among them, which are\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsuggestive of building foundations. These terraces may have been used as a rocky base for rudimentary forms of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thabitation like those other <span class=\"popular\">Rutok</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ru thog</span> sites such\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tas spo sa mkhar (A-84) and <span class=\"popular\">Kharpoche</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mkhar po che</span> (A-86). Some of the eastern terraces were converted to corrals and wind shelters, but these\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thave been long abandoned. Also in the east sector, at the base of the formation, there are the remnants of at\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tleast five parallel walls, outworks that cover an area of no less than 1000 m&sup2;. Some of these defensive\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstructures appear to have been subsequently modified, probably for pastoral use. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>There are the remains of a structure (9 m x 7 m) that has been reduced to a pile of rubble situated 120 m\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsoutheast of the east end of the terraced zone. Twelve meters east of this structure there is a fragmentary\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tenclosure (2.5 m x 3.5 m) made with stones up to 1 m in length, which might be a funerary superstructure. On the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnorthwest corner of the terraced site there are two ungulate petroglyphs and a third indistinguishable carving\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat were made on a flat boulder. These appear to date to the prehistoric epoch. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n"}]}
