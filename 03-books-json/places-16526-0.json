In part, the name of the site must be derived from the tan sandstone found here, which has a yellowish cast from a distance. The steep walls of the formation endow the fortress with a strong geographic posture. The structures found here are in an advanced state of ruin, consequently there is only a limited amount of information that can be gleaned about the layout and design of the installation. The bulk of the stronghold consists of a series of defensive walls arrayed across the summit and upper flanks of the formation. Only tiny races of what were ostensibly buildings have survived. All structures are built of small pieces of sandstone (primarily 10 cm to 30 cm in length) laid in random-rubble courses.<\/p>"},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":"<p>According to the villagers of <span class=\"popular\">Rutok Nyingpa<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Ru thog rnying pa<\/span>, <span class=\"popular\">Khaser Ramo Gyamo Khar<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Kha ser ra mo rgya mo mkhar<\/span> was the first fortress of <span class=\"popular\">Rutok<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Ru thog<\/span>.

Near the east end of the summit a freestanding wall segment is 1.8 m in length and 60 cm in height. It appears to have been part of a building roughly covering 12 m\u00b2. The rim of the east summit (40 m x 4 m to 6 m) is lined with the remains of a defensive wall up to 1.5 m in height. Just below he summit, on the south side of the hill, there is a 1-m to 1.2-m high revetment wall, creating a level area (5 m x 2.5 m) that may have also supported a residential edifice. Likewise, just below the north side of the summit, a revetment (up to 1.7 m high) creates another flat (5.2 m x 5.8). There appears to be a wall footing on op of the upper edge of this structure. This revetment continues around to the southeast flank of the formation o produce another level area of narrower proportions.<\/p>"},{"title":"Southeast spur ramparts","index":8,"parent_index":6,"body":"<p>At the junction of the east summit and a southeast spur there is a small but well-defined area of defensive walls. The rocky backbone extends southeast for about 70 m, on which there are the remains of a defensive wall running the entire length. On an eastern spur-tip, a revetment (up to 1 m in height) forms a level area (5.5 m x 4.5 m). On the nearby western spur-tip there is a similar structure (5 m x 14 m) that supports a parapet wall (50 cm high). This latter revetment is in close proximity to the breastworks on the south flank of the formation.<\/p>"},{"title":"Southern ramparts","index":9,"parent_index":6,"body":"<p>Across the breadth of the south side of the hill there are a series of ramparts that extend about halfway down o the basin. They are a maximum of 1.2 m in height on the downhill side and usually flush with the uphill slope. Any freestanding masonry masses have long since disappeared. There appear to be five main structures following the natural inclination of the slope, which converge at different points and elevations to create a network of interconnected walls and protected pathways. This type of breastworks must have been predicated on a defensive strategy in which the hillside itself was the fasthold, obviating the need for many buildings. Using hese walls as cover, defenders could be deployed at will along the formation. Tactically, this style of ramparts seems to reflect the existence of a highly mobile force of archers and slingers who could sweep across he hillside, unleashing a curtain of fire.<\/p>"},{"title":"West summit complex","index":10,"parent_index":6,"body":"<p>The west summit is directly linked to the east summit, but it is around 4 m lower in elevation. The west summit (33 m x 4 m to 14 m) is blanketed in quite a bit of structural debris. Flanking the summit crest there are revetments that may have hosted buildings. On the east end of the summit there appears to be a building foundation (6 m x 4.5 m). Immediately below this foundation on the south side of the hill there appears to be another slightly smaller foundation. Near the west end of the summit there is another building foundation (6.5 m x 5 m). Beyond this point, the summit crest continues for an additional 18 m, but it is only around 2.5 m wide.

The prime location of <span class=\"popular\">Rutok Dzongri<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Ru thog rdzong ri<\/span>at the center of a network of agricultural valleys rich in archaic cultural sites, indicates that this was a very important location since antiquity.

A more credible etymology upheld by the eminent Bon scholar <span class=\"popular\">Lopp\u00f6n Tendzin Namdak<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Slob dpon bstan \u2019dzin rnam dag<\/span> and others is that <span class=\"popular\">Rutok<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Ru thog<\/span> (surmounted horns) refers to the ancient <span class=\"popular\">Zhang Zhung<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Zhang zhung<\/span> custom of enshrining the horns of wild ungulates on the op of houses, temples and castles.

It was destroyed before living memory and the village relocated to the adjacent valley bottom. The base of the hill used to be encircled with a defensive wall punctuated by gateways in the four cardinal directions. <span class=\"popular\">K\u00f6nchok Tsering<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Dkon mchog tshe ring<\/span>states that when he was a child remnants of this wall were still visible.

The hill of <span class=\"popular\">Rutok Dzongri<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Ru thog rdzong ri<\/span> is said to have the shape of an elephant and to be the residence of the territorial god (<span class=\"popular\">y\u00fcllha<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Yul lha<\/span>) known as <span class=\"popular\">Langboche<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Glang bo che<\/span>.
