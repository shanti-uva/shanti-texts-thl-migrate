Near the east end of the summit a freestanding wall segment is 1.8 m \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin length and 60 cm in height. It appears to have been part of a building roughly covering 12 m&sup2;. The rim of the \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\teast summit (40 m x 4 m to 6 m) is lined with the remains of a defensive wall up to 1.5 m in height. Just below \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe summit, on the south side of the hill, there is a 1-m to 1.2-m high revetment wall, creating a level area (5 \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tm x 2.5 m) that may have also supported a residential edifice. Likewise, just below the north side of the \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsummit, a revetment (up to 1.7 m high) creates another flat (5.2 m x 5.8). There appears to be a wall footing on \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttop of the upper edge of this structure.

On an eastern spur-tip, a revetment (up to 1 m in height) forms a level area (5.5 m x \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t4.5 m). On the nearby western spur-tip there is a similar structure (5 m x 14 m) that supports a parapet wall \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(50 cm high).

This type of breastworks must have been predicated on a \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdefensive strategy in which the hillside itself was the fasthold, obviating the need for many buildings.
