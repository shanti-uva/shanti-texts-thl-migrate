It was built on a sandy knoll situated in the midst of a large basin. This knoll is elevated about 2 m above the surrounding terrain. Pieces of milky quartz, carried to he site, probably indicate that it once had a ritual function (none is still observed).

These meandering rows of standing stones are located on the crest of the knoll. At least two different types of rocks were used as pillars.

There are also several broken pillars near the south end of the west row as well as a single broken specimen at the north end. All of the stelae are tabular and between 10 cm and 30 cm in thickness. Their broad sides are oriented north and south. It is difficult to know how precisely the pillars were aligned due to their movement over the centuries. Some appear to have gradually twisted into their current positions. The west row (11.5 m long) contains 9 pillars 80 cm or more in height, with an average basal girth of around 1.2 m. The tallest pillar is 1.4 m in height and has a basal girth of 1.3 m. The smallest pillar is 50 cm in height with a basal girth of 1.1 m.

It begins nearly as far south as the west row, but extends much farther north. There are 16 pillars in the east row, several of which are broken. These pillars have the same basic characteristics and orientation as those in the west row. Four of the pillars are 1.1 m to 1.4 m in height with basal girths of around 1.2 m. The rest of the pillars are between 50 cm and 1 m in height. <\/p>  "}]}
