The site has long views to the east. Most other views from this sheltered location are constrained by the local topography. <span class=\"popular\">Nakgyam</span><span class=\"scholar\">Nag gyam</span> consists of not less than six funerary structures built of unshaped light-colored metamorphic rocks (?), which are generally 20 cm to 80 cm in length. In addition to more minor structural traces, major structures may have been overlooked during the survey because of the large and diffuse nature of the <span class=\"popular\">Nakgyam</span><span class=\"scholar\">Nag gyam</span> site. Also, these superficial funerary structures are not so easy to recognize among the naturally occurring rocky convolutions of the site. <span class=\"popular\">Nakgyam</span><span class=\"scholar\">Nag gyam</span> was well suited to funerary activities, as this location is not particularly conducive to pastoral, agricultural or settlement activities. </p> "},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":" <p>According to local sources, <span class=\"popular\">Nakgyam</span><span class=\"scholar\">Nag gyam</span> is associated with the ancient <span class=\"popular\">Mön</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span>.</p> "},{"title":"Site elements","index":6,"parent_index":2,"body":" "},{"title":"Funerary Structure FS1","index":7,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p>Funerary structure FS1 (3 m x 1.5 m) is situated on a wide bench above the valley floor (30° 15.234΄ N. lat. / 84° 28.957΄ E. long.). It is the most southerly specimen at <span class=\"popular\">Nakgyam</span><span class=\"scholar\">Nag gyam</span>. FS1 is a fragmentary single-course rectangular enclosure whose perimeter walls are flush with the surface or which rise above it to a height of 20 cm. Small stones are scattered over he enclosure, many of which are partially submerged. </p> "},{"title":"Funerary Structure FS2","index":8,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p>Funerary structure FS2 (12 m x 13 m) is a highly dissolute round enclosure (15.395΄ / 28.873΄).

FS4 appears to have consisted of two interconnected irregularly shaped cells. Most of this highly fragmentary enclosure exhibits a heaped-stone wall perimeter.

On the uphill side of the structure, the perimeter is comprised of a random-rubble dry-mortar wall (60 cm high) that was built into the side of the hollow.

This structure is elevated about 50 cm above ground level. Its perimeter consists of double-course walls (around 60 cm thick). The south wall of FS6 is he most intact. The interior of this structure is almost completely sheathed in stones with no ordered stonework discernable. FS6 (6 m x 6.3 m) has two sides that are indented to create a modified L-shaped plan.
