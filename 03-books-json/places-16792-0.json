The site is situated on\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsandy and turf-blanketed slopes with fairly gentle gradients. There are many granite outcrops dotting these\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tslopes. The terraced funerary structures of <span class=\"popular\">Rachen</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ra chen</span> have rectangular, ovoid and trapezoidal forms. They tend to be grouped in meandering rows, each\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof which is set at the same elevation. Most of these funerary structures are small and simply built with little\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tevidence of coherent wall segments. The rim and forward flank of each structure are lined with stones with no\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tapparent order or arrangement, save for a vertical stacking of stones in a few instances. In those structures with\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttwo longer walls, these are usually oriented perpendicular to the axis of the slope. The forward flanks of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tterraced funerary structures are flush with the downhill slope or elevated above it to a height of 20 cm to 1 m\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(larger specimens). The rear walls, where they exist, are usually flush with the uphill slope. These structures\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tare free from structural elements located inside the outer walls. The terraced funerary structures are mostly\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconstructed of variable-length (10 cm to 60 cm long) uncut pieces of white granite. <span class=\"popular\">Rachen</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ra chen</span> is the most westerly example of the eastern <span class=\"popular\">Jangtang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Byang thang</span> variant of terraced funerary structures\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdocumented to date.
