The double-course perimeter walls (50 cm to 60 cm thick) are mostly comprised of smaller uncut pieces of limestone (10 cm to 45 cm long). These stones are flush with the ground surface or are elevated above it to a maximum height of 30 cm. There are also a few slabs that were laid flat on the ground near the south corner of the enclosure. The southeast wall of the enclosure is largely intact and the other walls are partially so. There is possibly an opening (around 30 cm wide) in the southeast wall. This apparent opening is situated 1.65 m and 2.6 m from the corners of the enclosure. </p>",

The broad sides of this pillar are oriented parallel to the long walls of the enclosure. Orange climax lichen grows on the north side of the main pillar and there are brown encrustations on this side of the standing stone as well.
