The double-course perimeter walls (50 cm to 60 cm thick) are mostly comprised of smaller uncut pieces of limestone (10 cm to 45 cm long). These stones are flush with the ground surface or are elevated above it to a maximum height of 30 cm. There are also a few slabs that were laid flat on the ground near the south corner of the enclosure. The southeast wall of the enclosure is largely intact and the other walls are partially so. There is possibly an opening (around 30 cm wide) in the southeast wall. This apparent opening is situated 1.65 m and 2.6 m from the corners of the enclosure. <\/p> "},{"title":"Pillars","index":8,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p>The main pillar is well centered in between the longer walls of the enclosure. This irregularly shaped tabular pillar (90 cm [height] x 1.3 m [basal girth]) is planted 70 cm from the inner edge of the northwest wall. The broad sides of this pillar are oriented parallel to the long walls of the enclosure. Orange climax lichen grows on the north side of the main pillar and there are brown encrustations on this side of the standing stone as well. Near the west corner of the enclosure there is a much smaller irregularly shaped pillar (30 cm x 70 cm). <\/p>  "}]}
