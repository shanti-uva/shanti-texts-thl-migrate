   "body": "<p>According to oral tradition, Pad ma bdud ’dud, the youngest son of Khod po sNang ldan, married Chos mtsho and had three sons. The eldest, Nam mkha’i rgyal po, founded Zla ’od Monastery (No.146), and became known as Zla ’od Nam mkha’i rgyal po, the second son, Nyi ma’i rgyal po, founded gTsug ’od Monastery (No.147) near by, and was subsequently known as gTsug ’od Nyi ma’i rgyal po. The youngest son founded a monastery at sTag mgo gdong, on a hill resembling the head of a tiger, in a valley called gYang zla gzhi in the same locality as the other two monasteries. The year of the monastery’s foundation is believed to be 1124A.D., but there is no evidence to substantiate this. </p><p>Zla ’od Nam mkha’i rgyal po was the prelate of the kings of Khro skyabs and Brag steng, two of the eighteen kingkdoms of rGyal rong. The history of the monastery after his time, as well as the chronology of its successive masters remain unclear: </p><ol type=\"1\"> <li>Zla ’od Nam mkha’i rgyal po </li> <li>gYung drung rgyal mtshan </li> <li>bSod nams rgyal mtshan </li> <li>gTshug phud </li> <li>Shes rab bkra shis </li> <li>Nyi ma rgyal mtshan </li> <li>Nam mkha’ rgyal mtshan </li> <li>sByin pa ’od zer </li> <li>Nam mkha’ lhun grub </li> <li>bSlab gsum phun tshogs </li> <li>bSam gtan </li> <li>rGyal ba g-yung drung </li> <li>A don</li> <li>bsTan ’dzin rnam rgyal </li> <li>Pad ma rgyal mtshan </li> <li>’Chi med </li> </ol><p>Since dPal yul district belonged to sDe dge in the past, many of the masters mentioned above were close to the kings of sDe dge, and several among them served as their prelates.</p><p>Unfortunately none of their dates seem credible enough to mention here although I attempted to determine the dates of some of them. </p><p>I was excited to find a long script on the ancient wall in the assembly hall (’du khang) which I hoped would yield some important historical information about the monastery. A monk at the monastery spent much time and energy making a copy of it for me, but unfortunately its content is disappointing. However, it says that the assembly hall was built by a bSod nams rgyal po, and not Nam mkha’i rgyal po as mentioned above, although no dates are provided. Otherwise the entire inscription is devoted to the praise of the assembly hall and to the description of the statues within. </p><p>During the time of gTsug ’od, Zla ’od and gTsug ’od monasteries performed all of their annual rituals together. Despite the damage suffered during the Cultural Revolution, around 11,534 meters of the original wall-patings within the assembly hall have been preserved.</p>",
