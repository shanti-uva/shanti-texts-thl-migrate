   "body": "<p>The small island of <span class=\"popular\">Gönpé Do</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dgon pa’i do</span> hosts the vestiges of all-stone residential structures. This island is located less than 1 km from the south shore of the freshwater lake mtsho mo ngang la ring mo. <span class=\"popular\">Gönpé Do</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dgon pa’i do</span> is only accessible on foot in the winter or by boat during other times of he year. This insular site must have provided the ancient settlers with a strong defensive posture. The early settlement of the island is liable to have had religious and geomantic dimensions connected to the sacred status of mtsho mo ngang la ring mo. The placement of the residential facility in the midst of a lake goddess afforded it an innermost or secret aspect, as well as a mantle of social and economic exclusivity. There were no less than six habitational structures at <span class=\"popular\">Gönpé Do</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dgon pa’i do</span>, which could have potentially housed more than two dozen people. The scant structural evidence preserved at the site indicates that these buildings were of the <span class=\"popular emph\">do khang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rdo khang</span> type. All structures at <span class=\"popular\">Gönpé Do</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dgon pa’i do</span> have a southern aspect and were constructed with random-rubble walls. These highly weathered walls were mud mortared but much of this adhesive material has disappeared with time. </p>",

Below the summit on the southwest side of the island there is a tiny ruined building (2.5 m x 2.5 m) built into a cliff. Its exterior walls reach 1.3 m and interior walls 90 cm in height. Adjacent to this structure there is a foundation (4 m x 4.7 m) that must have supported an independent building. On a wide bench 13.5 m to the south there are the ruins of a cubic shrine (1.3 m x 1.3 m x 50 cm). Upslope, or 13.5 m to the north of this shrine, there are scant remains at two levels under the summit. These are the probable vestiges of another building. On the same bench as the shrine, 8 m to the northeast, there are traces of another small residential structure whose rear flank was built into a steep slope (3.4 x 3.3 m). Another residential structure may be located 19 m southwest of the shrine but almost nothing of it has endured. </p>",

Its design and constructional features identify this structure as a <span class=\"popular emph\">do khang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rdo khang</span>. This all-stone edifice was split between two elevations (6.7 m x 5.2 m). Its walls are 50 cm o 60 cm thick. The lower level has been mostly eliminated. The upper level consists of two rooms: southwest (90 cm x 1.3 m) and northeast (3 m x 1.8 m). These two rooms were built 1.2 m into the rear slope. The rear rooms are interconnected by a tiny entrance (60 cm x 60 cm). The tiny southwest compartment is too small to have been inhabited and must have had an alternative function (storage or ritual?). The forward wall of the rear tier attains a maximum height of 1.6 m. There is a small niche on the exterior side of the wall in front of the rear southwest room. Bits of mud plaster still stick to the interior walls of the edifice. </p>",
