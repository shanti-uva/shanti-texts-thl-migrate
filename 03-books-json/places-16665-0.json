Bounding he valley, in the proximity, is a dark-colored rock outcrop. The terrain is almost level and covered in small rocks and gravel. There are excellent views to the east and west and a fairly long view to the south. The black pillar and white pillar erected inside the enclosure have inspired the current name of the site. Three of the four <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma ṇi</span> plaques found at the site are broken.</p>

These slabs are 2 cm to 7 cm thick and project 10 cm to 20 cm above ground level. Parts of all four walls of the enclosure are intact, including about 50 percent of the original number of slabs. Other slabs of the enclosure lie dispersed around the site. </p>
