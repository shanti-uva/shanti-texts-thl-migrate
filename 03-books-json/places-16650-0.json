These double-course slab walls are 60 cm to 70 cm thick. Small parts of all four walls are intact. There also appears to have been an inner enclosure that shares its north and west walls in common with the outer enclosure. The inner enclosure, a unique design feature in this II.1b typology site, measures 8 m (north-south) x 6.5 m (east-west). Due to extreme degradation, the wall type of the inner enclosure is unclear (possibly made of slabs as well). </p>

The three existing pillars are made of a beige-colored rock that has weathered to a tan color. </p>
