It is primarily made up of slabs (20 cm to 70 cm long) set into the ground edgewise. These double-course slab walls are 60 cm to 70 cm thick. Small parts of all four walls are intact. There also appears to have been an inner enclosure that shares its north and west walls in common with the outer enclosure. The inner enclosure, a unique design feature in this II.1b typology site, measures 8 m (north-south) x 6.5 m (east-west). Due to extreme degradation, the wall type of the inner enclosure is unclear (possibly made of slabs as well). <\/p> "},{"title":"Pillars","index":8,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p>Near the west wall of the inner enclosure there are two broken tabular pillars. These pillars measure 75 cm (height) x 90 cm (basal girth) and 40 cm x 90 cm. The smaller one was originally substantially taller. Approximately 2.5 m away, near the south wall of the inner enclosure, there is a broken four-sided pillar (70 cm x 90 cm). The three existing pillars are made of a beige-colored rock that has weathered to a tan color. <\/p>  "}]}
