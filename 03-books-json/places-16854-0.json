On top of the saddle, 25 m to the south, there are the remains of a double-course, sub-rectangular enclosure (17 m x 9.5 m). The perimeter wall fragments are well built and around 75 cm in thickness. Larger stones (primarily 40 cm to 70 cm long) were used to build these walls. The longest stone in this enclosure is 1 m, and some stones were inserted upright into the wall courses.

Many of the upright stone slabs forming the perimeter walls of the subsidiary enclosure are elevated 20 cm to 40 cm above ground level. The largest slab used in its construction is 1.2 m in length. Through the agency of gravity most of these slabs are now inclined at various angles. There are also two pillar-like stones, 60 cm in height, in the subsidiary enclosure. The cubic tomb and subsidiary enclosure are symmetrically arrayed inside the large outer enclosure.
