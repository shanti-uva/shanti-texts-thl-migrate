This contrasts to \"basic syllabic etymology\", which simply gives a straight forward account of what each syllable denotes in its own right, and how that relates to the term's overall meaning - in other words, a layman's understanding rather than a deep linguistic analysis. It also contrasts to \"creative etymologies\", which are highly interpretative renderings of the syllables' individual associations in service of the author's very specific semantic interpretation of the term.</p> </div> ","title":"Overview"}]}
