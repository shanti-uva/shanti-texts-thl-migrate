The other division contains treatises by later B&ouml;npo masters.  While it is common to borrow the Buddhist terms Kangyur (bka' 'gyur) and  Tengyur (brten 'gyur) to refer to these canonical collections of sacred  B&ouml;npo scriptures, followers of B&ouml;n call their collections Ka (bka') and  Katen (bka' brten), meaning \"the Word\" and \"[treatises] relying on the  Word.\"</p>","title":""}]}
