To the west, the site is skirted by an adjacent ridge. <span class=\"popular\">Droklhé Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Grog lhas rdo ring</span> consists of three pillars erected in a north-south oriented row. There is a rocky area east of hese pillars, which may be the remains of some type of walled structure. There may even be wall traces around all sides of these pillars but the evidence is inconclusive. If it was fenced, <span class=\"popular\">Droklhé Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Grog lhas rdo ring</span> actually belongs to the II.2b typology. In any event, areas adjoining the site are largely free of stones. Like nearby <span class=\"popular\">Zangdong Möndo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Zangs gdong mon rdo</span> (C-170),<span class=\"popular\">Droklhé Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Grog lhas rdo ring</span> probably had a funerary ritual function. Nevertheless, there are no traces of other mortuary structures in the proximity. These structures, if they do exist, may lie buried under the sands of the site.</p>",
