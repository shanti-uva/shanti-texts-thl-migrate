The site was subsequently redeveloped and <span class=\"popular\">Chuser Gönpa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Chu gser dgon pa</span> founded here.<a href=\"#n62\" name=\"nb62\" class=\"note\">62</a> The castle ruins are concentrated on the east end of the site, which covers an area of 54 m x around 15 m. A revetment rings the entire site. The east end of this defensive structure base is around 4 m in height. It was designed to protect this vulnerable east approach to the installation. Other flanks of the ridgeline terminate in cliffs. As the oral tradition maintains, the buildings of <span class=\"popular\">Chuser Gönpa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Chu gser dgon pa</span> were planted on top of pre-existing structures. On the east end of the site there are low-profile unplastered stone structures, which appear to be reconstructed buildings that originally belonged to the citadel. They are windowless and have low ceilings and small entranceways (1.1 m x 75 cm to 1.2 m x 85 cm). There are also wall buttresses between the various small rooms. These architectonic features suggest that these were originally all-stone corbelled structures. They now have wooden roofs, however. In pre-modern times these buildings are said to have housed monks and to have been used for storage. In some places the ramparts around the site were also rebuilt. This reconstruction is evidenced in the low quality stone courses and irregular seams. The parapet wall rises as much as 70 cm above the summit. </p> "},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":" <p>According to local sources, an ancient castle called <span class=\"popular\">Wutsé Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dbu rtse mkhar</span> stood at this site before the founding of <span class=\"popular\">Chuser</span><span class=\"scholar\">Chu gser</span>monastery.

These all appear to have been relatively small structures. Only a tiny assembly hall has been rebuilt circa 1987.
