The east end of this defensive structure base is around 4 m in height. It was\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdesigned to protect this vulnerable east approach to the installation. Other flanks of the ridgeline terminate in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcliffs. As the oral tradition maintains, the buildings of <span class=\"popular\">Chuser G&ouml;npa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Chu gser dgon pa</span> were planted on top of pre-existing structures. On the east end of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe site there are low-profile unplastered stone structures, which appear to be reconstructed buildings that\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\toriginally belonged to the citadel. They are windowless and have low ceilings and small entranceways (1.1 m x 75\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcm to 1.2 m x 85 cm). There are also wall buttresses between the various small rooms. These architectonic features\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsuggest that these were originally all-stone corbelled structures. They now have wooden roofs, however. In\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpre-modern times these buildings are said to have housed monks and to have been used for storage. In some places\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe ramparts around the site were also rebuilt. This reconstruction is evidenced in the low quality stone courses\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand irregular seams. The parapet wall rises as much as 70 cm above the summit. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>According to local sources, an ancient castle called <span class=\"popular\">Wuts&eacute; Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dbu rtse mkhar</span> stood at this site before the founding of <span class=\"popular\">Chuser</span><span class=\"scholar\">Chu gser</span>monastery.
