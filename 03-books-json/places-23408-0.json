Later, the hermitage was extended into a monastery by\n                     sPa dPal ldan bzang po and then became an important centre of learning for\n                     Bonpo followers in Western Tibet. The monastery produced several monk-scholars:\n                     for example, Tre ston rGyal mtshan dpal who had compiled a type of\n                     encyclopedia, in the monastery, of Bon and Buddhist doctrines, entitled Bon <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">sgo gsal byed</span> and the well-known historian, sPa bsTan rgyal\n                     bzang po, who wrote several works in the same place in the 15th century.
