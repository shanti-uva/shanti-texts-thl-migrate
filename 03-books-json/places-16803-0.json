The site is divided into \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthree zones: lower sector, central sector and upper sector. All three sectors are located near the western edge of \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe valley and have an eastern aspect. The funerary structures of <span class=\"popular\">Tsok Gi M&ouml;ndur</span><span class=\"scholar\">Btsog gi mon dur</span> are made of uncut pieces of variable-length brown sandstone (up \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto 70 cm long). They consist of superficial enclosures of various types and structures with well developed, high \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\televation double-course walls. Mostly slabs of brown sandstone were used in construction. The size and complexity \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the <span class=\"popular\">Tsok Gi M&ouml;ndur</span><span class=\"scholar\">Btsog gi mon dur</span> structures \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tindicate that this was an important funerary complex.</p>\n<p>Like other funerary sites in <span class=\"popular\">Reco</span><span class=\"scholar\">Re co</span> (D-92, D-93, \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tD-94, D-95, D-96, E-28), in addition to possibly housing deceased members of the local population, <span class=\"popular\">Tsok Gi M&ouml;ndur</span><span class=\"scholar\">Btsog gi mon dur</span> may have catered to the needs of \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdignitaries connected to the archaic residential sites in and around the central <span class=\"popular\">Rutok</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ru thog</span> location of <span class=\"popular\">Dzong Ri</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdzong ri</span> (A-16, A-17, A-90, A-91, A-92, A-93, A-108), located further east. No concentrations of \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfunerary structures have been surveyed in the vicinity of these residential sites (although two were spied near \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe side of the road, one near <span class=\"popular\">Rutok</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ru thog</span> and one in \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"popular\">Chulung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Chu lung</span>). <span class=\"popular\">Nyanlung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gnyan lung</span> contains large swathes of defunct agricultural lands, as do \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnearby valleys. This suggests that <span class=\"popular\">Reco</span><span class=\"scholar\">Re co</span> is likely \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto have had a greater population in the past, as compared to that of its contemporary pastoral one. Reportedly, \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe current (2003) population of <span class=\"popular\">Reco</span><span class=\"scholar\">Re co</span> is 220 \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsouls. The extreme desiccation of the region must have been a prime factor in the transition from agriculture to \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpastoralism in <span class=\"popular\">Reco</span><span class=\"scholar\">Re co</span>. Another interesting feature \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof <span class=\"popular\">Reco</span><span class=\"scholar\">Re co</span> is that no summit strongholds of any kind \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twere detected in the region.

The absence of castles in <span class=\"popular\">Reco</span><span class=\"scholar\">Re co</span> occurs despite the fact that the local branch valleys of <span class=\"popular\">Nyanlung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gnyan lung</span>, <span class=\"popular\">Dzau</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dza&rsquo;u</span>, <span class=\"popular\">Omlung</span><span class=\"scholar\">&rsquo;Om lung</span>, and <span class=\"popular\">Rama</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ra ma</span> <a class=\"note\" name=\"nb73\" href=\"#n73\">73</a> once supported agriculture.

Another puzzling matter is that not one ancient pillar site was \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdetected in <span class=\"popular\">Reco</span><span class=\"scholar\">Re co</span>, a region rich in funerary \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstructures.</p>\n"},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n<p>According to residents of <span class=\"popular\">Reco</span><span class=\"scholar\">Re co</span>, <span class=\"popular\">Tsok Gi M&ouml;ndur</span><span class=\"scholar\">Btsog gi mon dur</span> was an ancient <span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span> burial center.</p>\n"},{"title":"Site elements","index":6,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n"},{"title":"Lower sector","index":7,"parent_index":6,"body":"\n<p>The south sector is situated on a fairly steep rocky slope bounding the edge of the enclosing west ridge.

One wonders if this was part of a \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdeliberate effort on the part of the builders to conceal the site. The high degree of integration of the \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstructures with the parent topography may have involved religious considerations as well. Given the nature of \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe terrain, it is quite possible that funerary structures of the lower sector may have been overlooked during \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe survey.

The partly intact forward wall of FS4 has a maximum height of 90 cm and has as \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmany as 6 vertical courses of masonry still in situ.

These walls are 50 cm to 90 cm in \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\theight. In the middle of the top of FS4 there is an excavation around 2 m across, which is now partly filled \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twith stone rubble.

In order to create a level interior, the rear wall is set around 1.5 m below the \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tuphill slope and the forward wall is elevated about 1 m above the downhill slope. The interior of FS3 is now \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgently sloping, presumably because of the forces of erosion and geomorphologic changes. The perimeter walls of \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe enclosure range from flush with the ground surface to portions that are elevated above it as much as 60 \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcm. In the middle part of the interior, beginning 3.7 m from the north wall of the enclosure, there is a stone \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstructure 3.3 m across.

Stones up to 1 m in length lie about other portions of the enclosure perimeter.

A little \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcloser to the south side of FS12 there are three tiny structures made up of slabs. Two of these structures \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconsist of three upright slabs that form three sides of a rectangle. The fourth side of the structures is \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\topen.

The \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tother side contains a longer slab (50 cm and 65 cm) that protrudes 15 cm or 20 cm above the surface.
