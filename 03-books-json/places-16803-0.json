The site is divided into hree zones: lower sector, central sector and upper sector. All three sectors are located near the western edge of he valley and have an eastern aspect. The funerary structures of <span class=\"popular\">Tsok Gi M\u00f6ndur<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Btsog gi mon dur<\/span> are made of uncut pieces of variable-length brown sandstone (up o 70 cm long). They consist of superficial enclosures of various types and structures with well developed, high elevation double-course walls. Mostly slabs of brown sandstone were used in construction. The size and complexity of the <span class=\"popular\">Tsok Gi M\u00f6ndur<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Btsog gi mon dur<\/span> structures indicate that this was an important funerary complex.<\/p><p>Like other funerary sites in <span class=\"popular\">Reco<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Re co<\/span> (D-92, D-93, D-94, D-95, D-96, E-28), in addition to possibly housing deceased members of the local population, <span class=\"popular\">Tsok Gi M\u00f6ndur<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Btsog gi mon dur<\/span> may have catered to the needs of dignitaries connected to the archaic residential sites in and around the central <span class=\"popular\">Rutok<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Ru thog<\/span> location of <span class=\"popular\">Dzong Ri<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdzong ri<\/span> (A-16, A-17, A-90, A-91, A-92, A-93, A-108), located further east. No concentrations of funerary structures have been surveyed in the vicinity of these residential sites (although two were spied near he side of the road, one near <span class=\"popular\">Rutok<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Ru thog<\/span> and one in <span class=\"popular\">Chulung<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Chu lung<\/span>). <span class=\"popular\">Nyanlung<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Gnyan lung<\/span> contains large swathes of defunct agricultural lands, as do nearby valleys.

Reportedly, he current (2003) population of <span class=\"popular\">Reco<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Re co<\/span> is 220 souls. The extreme desiccation of the region must have been a prime factor in the transition from agriculture to pastoralism in <span class=\"popular\">Reco<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Re co<\/span>. Another interesting feature of <span class=\"popular\">Reco<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Re co<\/span> is that no summit strongholds of any kind were detected in the region.

The absence of castles in <span class=\"popular\">Reco<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Re co<\/span> occurs despite the fact that the local branch valleys of <span class=\"popular\">Nyanlung<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Gnyan lung<\/span>, <span class=\"popular\">Dzau<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Dza\u2019u<\/span>, <span class=\"popular\">Omlung<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">\u2019Om lung<\/span>, and <span class=\"popular\">Rama<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Ra ma<\/span> <a class=\"note\" name=\"nb73\" href=\"#n73\">73<\/a> once supported agriculture. Perhaps this region was specially singled out for elite burial activities (although two non-summit residential sites were also detected in <span class=\"popular\">Reco<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Re co<\/span>: B-43, B-44).

It is located just up from the mouth of the valley. The terrain is marked by a series of natural stone furrows and berms, which act to camouflage the presence of the funerary structures. One wonders if this was part of a deliberate effort on the part of the builders to conceal the site. The high degree of integration of the structures with the parent topography may have involved religious considerations as well. Given the nature of he terrain, it is quite possible that funerary structures of the lower sector may have been overlooked during he survey. The walls of the lower sector structures are aligned to the slope (axial and transverse directions), not in the compass points.<\/p>"},{"title":"Funerary Structure FS4","index":8,"parent_index":7,"body":"<p>Funerary structure FS4 (5 m x 7 m) is the largest and highest structure of the lower sector.

The partly intact forward wall of FS4 has a maximum height of 90 cm and has as many as 6 vertical courses of masonry still in situ. Stones up to 1 m in length went into the construction of he forward wall. Parts of the west\/rear and north walls are also extant. These walls are 50 cm to 90 cm in height. In the middle of the top of FS4 there is an excavation around 2 m across, which is now partly filled with stone rubble.

The exposed grave chamber or reliquary (approximately 2 m x 2 m) is visible in the middle of the structure. This chamber is now only 30 cm deep.

This large, fairly intact enclosure is aligned in the cardinal directions, and measures 21 m (north-south) x 12 m (east-west). The remaining structural evidence indicates that perimeter walls of FS3 were of the double-course type and not just a jumble of stones. In order to create a level interior, the rear wall is set around 1.5 m below the uphill slope and the forward wall is elevated about 1 m above the downhill slope. The interior of FS3 is now gently sloping, presumably because of the forces of erosion and geomorphologic changes. The perimeter walls of he enclosure range from flush with the ground surface to portions that are elevated above it as much as 60 cm. In the middle part of the interior, beginning 3.7 m from the north wall of the enclosure, there is a stone structure 3.3 m across. Due to much deterioration, the design of this structure is no longer discernable. It probably marks the location of a subsurface grave. Also in the middle portion of FS3, beginning 6 m from the south wall, there is what appears to be a quadrate structure (3 m x 2.6 m). This structure also probably marks he location of a subterranean tomb. On the southwest corner of the FS3 enclosure, stones are heaped up to a height of about 1 m.<\/p>"},{"title":"Upper sector","index":20,"parent_index":6,"body":"<p>The upper sector is found farther up the <span class=\"popular\">Nyanlung<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Gnyan lung<\/span> valley.

This large, but poorly preserved, enclosure has lost almost all structural coherence. It is built of a gray stone and the entire structure is somewhat elevated above the surrounding plain. A single line of slabs that extends for 9 m along the western portion of the south wall is the only intact structure. These slabs are 50 cm to 70 cm in length and lie flat (perhaps originally they were erected upright). Stones up to 1 m in length lie about other portions of the enclosure perimeter. Inside the enclosure here are upright stones here and there that protrude 10 cm to 30 cm above the ground surface.<\/p><p>A double-course wall of small cobbles (5 cm to 10 cm long) is situated 14 m southeast of the FS12 enclosure. This wall forms an arc, 2 m in length, and appears to be the vestige of a more elaborate structure. A little closer to the south side of FS12 there are three tiny structures made up of slabs. Two of these structures consist of three upright slabs that form three sides of a rectangle. The fourth side of the structures is open. The two side wall slabs (40 cm to 55 cm) are somewhat shorter and flush with the sandy surface. The other side contains a longer slab (50 cm and 65 cm) that protrudes 15 cm or 20 cm above the surface. The third analogous structure has been reduced to just one slab, 60 cm long with a protrusion of 15 cm above ground level. These three trilithic structures form a row and are spaced about 3.5 m from one another.
