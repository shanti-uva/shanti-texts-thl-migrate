These structures are elevated 1 m to 1.5 m above the surrounding plain on their north and east sides. The perimeter walls appear to be composed of stones that were heaped up above ground level (type II.2c), but they are not very well developed. The general form of the enclosures is also in keeping with type II.2c structures. The perimeter walls were built primarily from smaller stones, although some stones reach 50 cm in length. On the west side of the large enclosure there is a 13.5 m gap in the perimeter wall. A slight concavity has formed inside the large enclosure. <\/p>  "}]}
