It is located 1 km up the <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Topchen<\/span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">stobs chen<\/span><\/em>) valley from its confluence with the <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dzongchu<\/span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">rdzong chu<\/span><\/em>).

The extent of the structural remains located at <span class=\"place\" title=\"F16583\">Menla Podrang<\/span> (South) indicates that this residential site was larger than any of the contemporary Buddhist monasteries at <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Mount Tisé<\/span>. The three all-stone complexes of <span class=\"place\" title=\"F16583\">Menla Podrang<\/span> (South) represent a very important nucleus of early settlement at <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Tisé<\/span>. They likely represent an archaic religious center of the <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">sekhang\/semkhar<\/span> (<span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\"><em>gsas khang\/gsas mkhar<\/em><\/span>) class. These three complexes are situated 90 m to 170 m above the right side of the valley floor. Their lofty location, all-stone corbelled construction, and other constructional features identify them as belonging to the archaic cultural horizon. The three complexes are designated as east, west and upper. All three have a southern aspect. The east complex and west complex were built on rocky <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">drama<\/span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">gra ma<\/span><\/em>) brush-covered slopes. The random-work, 50-cm- to 80-cm-thick walls appear to have been both mortared lightly with mud and of the dry-mortar variety. The blocks were partly hewn into shape, and are primarily between 30 cm and 1 m in length. Roof appurtenances are mainly 1 m to 1.5 m in length. Despite there being a heap of old <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">mani<\/span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ma Ni<\/span><\/em>) plaques around the base of what appears to be a ruined <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">chörten<\/span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">mchod rten<\/span><\/em>) some distance from the east complex<em>,<\/em> the <span class=\"place\" title=\"F16583\">Menla Podrang<\/span> (South) site seems to have been the object of very little Buddhist activity.<\/p> "},{"title":"Oral Tradition","index":2,"parent_index":0,"body":" <p>None was obtained.<\/p> "},{"title":"Site Elements","index":3,"parent_index":0,"body":" "},{"title":"East Complex","index":4,"parent_index":3,"body":" "},{"title":"Main Edifice","index":5,"parent_index":4,"body":" <p>The large main edifice of the east complex is set on a 15° slope next to a ravine, and measures 16.5 m (north-south, in line with the slope gradient) x 21 m (east-west, lateral slope direction). It was built in four main elevations: lower tier, lower-middle tier, upper-middle tier, and upper tier (5030 m). Corbels and bridging stones lie scattered around the site and farther afield.<\/p> <p>The lowest or most forward foundation wall of the main edifice is well aligned in the cardinal directions, and other walls more or less follow this orientation. The 3.5-m wide lower tier of the structure may only have consisted of a retaining wall and not a superstructure, but little structural evidence is left to appraise.<\/p> <p>The middle tier of the main edifice is approximately 6 m wide. The east half of this level of the structure appears to have consisted of a walled courtyard. The east-facing entranceway to the east half of the middle tier opens onto this courtyard. This appears to have been the main entrance of the main edifice. This entryway measures at least 1.2 m high x 70 cm. Located in a 2.3-m high wall segment, the lintel over this entrance is <em>in situ<\/em>. It accesses an axial corridor with lower-middle tier rooms set on both its north and south sides. Outside the main entrance there seem to be the remains of another room that appears to have had an independent entrance. On the north side of the medial corridor there is a room largely filled with rubble (1.5 m x 1.2 m). There were two or three niches built into the walls of this room. The lintel and roof of this north room have endured; the doorway accessing it is typically small. From the central corridor there is a 1-m long aisle that runs perpendicular (south-north), which accesses one or two rooms set on the south side of the lower-middle tier. The walls around these rooms are very fragmentary. From these forward lower-middle tier rooms there is access to a rear lower-middle tier room, which has a largely intact roof. The internal dimensions of this irregularly shaped room are 1.3 m x 2 m. None of these lower-middle tier rooms extend as far as the external west wall of the <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">sekhang<\/span>. The upper-middle tier rooms are also reached via the central corridor. Above the entire lower-middle tier and axial corridor, and extending to the exterior west wall of the main edifice, there were probably seven or eight small rooms in total, however, most partitions between them have been destroyed. The upper-middle tier covers approximately 50 m².<\/p> <p>The upper tier of the main edifice appears to have consisted of three relatively large rooms with an east-west orientation. In addition, there is another room to the rear of the central room. This rear central room (2 m x 1.3 m) has a large central niche. Not including their exterior walls, the row of three rooms measures 6.7 m x 2.4 m. Internally, walls still reach a height of 2 m. A lone roof slab over the central room is in place as is one corbel on the rear wall of the east room. A large boulder is integrated into the exterior west wall.<\/p> <p>Adjacent to these upper tier rooms there is a relatively large room to the east, which has an independent entrance. It has interior dimensions of 3.2 m x 2 m (not including the entrance area) and exterior dimensions of 4 m x 4.5 m; these relative proportions convey the general massiveness of the <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">sekhang<\/span> walls. The roof over the west half of this independent upper tier structure has survived. It is of typical construction: stone beams run diagonally over the corners of the walls, upon which transverse bridging stones were laid. This understructure supports the roof slabs. There are also large corbels protruding from the east half of the rear wall as load-bearing structures. In the south wall there is a niche and possibly a small window below it. This independent east room opens onto the middle tier room that probably had an independent entrance.                <\/p> "},{"title":"Outlying Structures","index":6,"parent_index":4,"body":" <p>Just above the main edifice of the east complex there are two walled level areas, the larger of which measures 13 m x 7 m. The disintegrated walls of these enclosures have been reduced to 1 m or less in height. Their function is not known. The base of what appears to have been a <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">chörten<\/span> (3.7 m x 3.5 m) is located on the opposite side of the ravine from the main edifice. In close proximity there is a highly degraded enclosure, measuring about 3.5 m across. Approximately 15 m above these structures, at the edge of a ledge, there are the remains of what appears to have been a later historic period retreat house (3.5 m x 5 m).<\/p> "},{"title":"Upper Edifice","index":7,"parent_index":4,"body":" <p>The upper edifice is comprised of a single <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">dokhang<\/span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">rdo khang<\/span><\/em>) built on a shelf against a cliff (5080 m). It measures 9 m (east-west) x 8 m (north-south). Roof members are strewn around the site; clearly this was an all-stone structure. This building consists of two rows of cells: a forward\/lower tier and a rear\/upper tier.<\/p> <p>The lower row of compartments in the upper edifice is highly degraded, but on the east end of the structure small sections of the roof have survived on top of collapsed walls. The lower row of rooms does not appear to have extended as far west as those of the upper tier.<\/p> <p>An 80-cm thick wall separates the lower tier from the upper tier of the upper edifice. Between this wall and the upper row of three rooms there is an 80-cm wide axial passageway, which runs the entire east-west breadth of the upper edifice. This passageway is situated at the same elevation as the upper tier compartments. It was roofed as evidenced by a single bridging stone spanning the corridor at the juncture of the west and central rooms. The three rooms of the upper tier have intact roofs and entranceways. The rear of these three rooms was built into the adjoining cliff and their roof is flush with the level of the uphill slope, according them a semi-subterranean aspect. The exterior west wall at 2.5 m is the highest elevation structure extant in the upper edifice. The interior dimensions of the west room are 1.9 m x 1.1 m x 1.8 m. There is a niche in the forward wall and an aperture (35 cm x 45 cm) in the side wall that opens to the central room. The entranceway to the west room (1.3 m x 60 cm) is partially blocked by debris. The central room (2 m x 1.4 m x 1.8 m) has an entranceway at least 1 m in height and 70 cm in width (it is also obstructed by debris). There is an internal opening (45 cm x 45 cm) between the central and east rooms. In the east room (2.6 m x 2 m x 2 m) there are the remains of a hearth against the rear wall, as well as a niche in this wall. In the east wall there is a shallow, floor-to-ceiling alcove with stone shelving. There is also a stone structure of unknown function extending from the alcove to the middle of the room. The entranceway to the east room is 70 cm wide; its height is unclear due to obstructions.<\/p> "},{"title":"West Complex","index":8,"parent_index":3,"body":" <p>Several hundreds of meters to the west of the east complex of <span class=\"place\" title=\"F16583\">Menla Podrang<\/span> (South) there are the vestiges of eight buildings (residential structures RS1 to RS8), which comprise the west complex of the site (4980 m to 5000 m).
