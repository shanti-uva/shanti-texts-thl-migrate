<p>Some of the texts included in this cycle present their own versions of the four intermediate processes.  <em>The Totally Radiant Seminal Nucleus</em> (<span class=\"tibtext\" title=\"Type ID here\">thig le kun gsal</span>) substitutes meditation for dying in its presentation:  (i) natural intermediate process, (ii) intermediate process of contemplation, (iii) intermediate process of dreaming, and (iv) intermediate process of reality.  <em>The Victorious Intention of the Quintessential Esoteric Precepts </em>(<span class=\"tibtext\" title=\"Type ID here\">man ngag snying gi dgongs pa rgyal ba</span>) has its own fourfold presentation of (i) natural intermediate process, (ii) intermediate process of contemplation, (iii) intermediate process of dreaming, and (iv) intermediate process of reality.</p>
