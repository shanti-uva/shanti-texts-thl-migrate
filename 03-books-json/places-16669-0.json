It measures 11 m (east to west) x\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t12.5 m (east wall) and 14.5 m (west wall). This enclosure is unusual for having longer dimensions north-south\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthan east-west. The walls of the perimeter (around 50 cm thick) contain uncut slabs and some blockwork (20 cm to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t85 cm long) inserted into the ground edgewise. A few of the slabs are as little as 2 cm in thickness. The stones\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the walls protrude as much as 25 cm above ground level. Little of the enclosing walls have survived.
