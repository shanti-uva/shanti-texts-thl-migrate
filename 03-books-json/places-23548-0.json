The monks in Ri spun Monastery indicated that their monastery was associated with rDzong gsar, a Sa skya pa monastery in the same county, and that I would probably find some information concerning Ri spun in the historical records of rDzong gsar Monastery. I found only one account of rDzong gsar’s history, entitled rDzong gsar dgon gyi lo gyus (MS, anonymous), but the name of Ri spun is not even mentioned there. Yet several people, including Buddhists and government officials, also confirmed the connection between Ri spun and rDzong gsar. Indeed the monasteries maintain very close ties and rDzong gsar, being the wealthier of the two, even supports Ri spun Monastery. However, rDzong gsar does not acknowledge its Bon related origin, not even in its historical records. The local inhabitants say that there is a stone tablet with an inscription concerning the history of Ri spun and rDzong gsar in the place from lHa tshe dbang of dPal spungs thang on the shore of gSer ngu g.yu mtsho lake with an inscription concerning the history of Ri spun and rDzong gsar, but Blo gros phun tshogs, the author of Ri spun dgon gyi lo rgyus, says that he could not find it. There are ruins of an ancient castle at the top of a hill near the monastery called Khyung po rdzong, and there are several rather vague legends concerning its history, but no one seems to know anything precise about it. According to oral tradition, the monastery was founded in a Fire-Hare Year, but in which Rab byung remains unknown. It is said that several famous masters, such as Shar pa rNal ’byor, Khyung po Blo gros rgyal mtshan, Bu ’bor Tog gi rgyal mtshan, Du tshe rTogs ldan and Ri bla Ye shes stayed at the monastery. In the latter half of Ri bla Ye shes’s life, the monastery was destroyed in a local conflict and that it was rebuilt by Ri bla Dar rgyas. Unfortunately, the dates of the masters mentioned above remain unknown. The monastery was destroyed during the Cultural Revolution and in 1983 permission was granted for its reconstruction.</p> "},{"title":"4.
