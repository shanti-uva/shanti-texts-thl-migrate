It begins at the northwest foot of the granite spire. On the high north end of the summit there are four buildings and\/or rooms, reached via an entryway on the east side of the formation. This portal still has its gray stone lintel in place. Below the entranceway there is a chamber in the formation that is at least 2 m deep. Along the east flank of the formation, what remains of a passageway on a ledge leads to he three rooms of the south summit. There are also the vestiges of two rooms along the side of this passageway. From the edge of the summit a collection of ruined buildings follows the southwest side of the ridgeline downward. This line of small structures contained at least nine interconnected buildings (38 m x 7 m to 9 m). There are also several outlying structures in extremely poor condition to the south of this row of buildings. At he south base of the formation there are a few ill-defined structural remains as well. The tallest extant wall segment at the <span class=\"popular\">Kharpoche<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Mkhar po che<\/span> castle is 3 m. The 50 cm to 60 cm thick walls of the various structures are composed of mud-mortared random-rubble containing pieces of granite, mostly 10 cm to 50 cm in length. <\/p> "},{"title":"Ancient village","index":8,"parent_index":6,"body":null}]}
