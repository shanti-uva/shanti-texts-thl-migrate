The summit complex is comprised of small contiguous structures built in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcrenellations of a granite formation (27 m x 3 m to 4.5 m), as well as structures situated on the southwest flank\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the formation. Although there are no stone roof appurtenances at the upper site, these buildings were small\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tenough and of the requisite design to have accommodated all-stone roofs. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Beginning at the north foot of the formation, 80 m below the summit installation, there are the remains of walled\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tterraces and foundations. They are situated on rocky slopes with a 20&ordm; to 45&ordm; gradient. The lower settlement\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcovers an area of approximately 18,000 m&sup2;. This is one of the largest archaic residential complexes surveyed to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdate. Most building foundations are concentrated at the upper end of the site.

The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfortification of such centers of habitation in <span class=\"popular\">Rutok</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ru thog</span> might possibly be connected to its geographic crossroads position, and invasions originating\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom the north and west. The housing structures were purposefully built into the slopes and against boulders,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgiving them a proximity to the earth that probably had both utilitarian (less stone needed for construction) and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tritual (ideal for the worship of chthonic deities) implications. The impression given by the ruins is that of a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbustling settlement of many dozens of rudimentary rock shelters and associated structures built on top of one\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tanother.

It begins at the northwest foot of the granite spire. On the high north end of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsummit there are four buildings and/or rooms, reached via an entryway on the east side of the formation. This\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tportal still has its gray stone lintel in place. Below the entranceway there is a chamber in the formation that\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tis at least 2 m deep. Along the east flank of the formation, what remains of a passageway on a ledge leads to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe three rooms of the south summit. There are also the vestiges of two rooms along the side of this passageway.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFrom the edge of the summit a collection of ruined buildings follows the southwest side of the ridgeline\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdownward. This line of small structures contained at least nine interconnected buildings (38 m x 7 m to 9 m).\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThere are also several outlying structures in extremely poor condition to the south of this row of buildings. At\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe south base of the formation there are a few ill-defined structural remains as well.

The many stones found\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\there provided ample building materials for the construction of the settlement. In total, there are at least 150\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twalled terraces and no less than 60 structures that appear to be the footings of buildings. The terraces are\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tirregularly shaped and average around 50 m&sup2;. The retaining walls creating them are made of chunks of granite (up\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto 1 m in length), which were laid without mortar. These highly disintegrated walls are up to 1.5 m in height.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe function of this system of terraces is not immediately obvious. They possibly served as a base for the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\terection of temporary shelters such as tents or other types of domestic operations. Due to the deterioration of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe site, the building foundations are not well delineated from the retaining walls. Only small sections of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdouble-course mud-mortared wall footings have survived. These walls are 60 cm to 80 cm in thickness and contain\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvariable-sized stones to 1 m in length. The sub-rectangular foundations (15 m&sup2; to 40m&sup2;) often integrate large\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnaturally occurring boulders. In one place, three stone beams (60 cm, 80 cm and 80 cm long) rest tenuously upon\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe top of the wall of a small room.
