Blo gros thogs med built a small temple and another for practitioners (sgrub khang) in Brag ra when he sanctified Mount sBa zhabs brag dkar, and named them Khod po Monastery. The place was successively named sNgags sde byang chub gling by Khyung rgod, bDud &rsquo;dul yang rtse gling by Nyi ma dbang ldan, and gNas sgo pad ma gling by gSang sngags gling pa (1864-?) when each of these masters visited the monastery.

It had two establishments, one for the ritual cycle of dBal gsas (dbal gsas sgrub grwa) and another for the atonement ritual of the goddess Srid pa rgyal mo (srid rgyal sgrub grwa). It had a giant thangka and a large collection of books including a complete manuscript copy of the Bonpo Kanjur made by Khod po Blo gros thogs med. The monks were required to take their ordination vows at sMan ri Monastery (No.1).<\/p> <p>2) &rsquo;Ong gong Monastery was founded by Khod po Blo gros thogs med at lCang log sna.<a href=\"#n34\" name=\"nb34\" class=\"note\">34<\/a> It started out as a hermitage and gradually expanded into a monastery, but fell into decline owing to an ongoing dispute with Nya mtsho. As a result it was moved to sMug rong dgu rdza brag dkar, but fell into decline again soon after its reconstruction, as two thirds of the monks were converted to Buddhism.<\/p> <p>The remaining monks followed Nyi ma rgyal mtshan, who at that time had returned to &rsquo;Dra valley from sMan ri. The site where they settled was called dGe gsar in the local dialect, which probably means dgon gsar, &ldquo;new monastery&rdquo;; the ruins of a stupa are still visible. A master of the monastery called A khu Ye shes, rebuilt a &rsquo;du khang with four columns and the monastery became known as &rsquo;Ong gong.

It was called Glang &rsquo;ong. The eldest brother was called gYung drung rgyal mtshan. After a few generations, the monastery was moved to sMong skyid and became known as sMong skyid dgon rnying, the &ldquo;old sMong skyid Monastery&rdquo;. Later when it was moved again it was known as both sMong skyid dgon gsar, the &ldquo;New sMong skyid Monastery&rdquo;, and Phun tshogs gling.
