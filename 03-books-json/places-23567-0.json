   "body": "<p>bSam ’grub combines three monasteries: Brag ra, ’Ong gong and sMong skyid.<a href=\"#n32\" name=\"nb32\" class=\"note\">32</a> </p><p>1) Brag ra Monastery was founded by Khod po Blo gros thogs med,<a href=\"#n33\" name=\"nb33\" class=\"note\">33</a> in the Iron-Ox year of the 5th Rab byung (1301). Blo gros thogs med built a small temple and another for practitioners (sgrub khang) in Brag ra when he sanctified Mount sBa zhabs brag dkar, and named them Khod po Monastery. The place was successively named sNgags sde byang chub gling by Khyung rgod, bDud ’dul yang rtse gling by Nyi ma dbang ldan, and gNas sgo pad ma gling by gSang sngags gling pa (1864-?) when each of these masters visited the monastery. Following is a list of the successive masters of the monastery:</p><ol type=\"1\"> <li>Blo gros rgyal mtshan </li> <li>rNam dag gtsug phud</li> <li>sGrub gshen sNang ldan</li> <li>Nyi ma dbang ldan (who rebuilt a larger assembly hall (’du khang) with twelve columns)</li> <li>rMe nag rTogs ldan </li> <li>rTul ’dre rTogs ldan </li> <li>Go tog rTogs ldan </li> <li>dBra ston Rin chen</li> <li>Khyung gter ’Od zer gling pa </li> <li>Khod spungs dBang ldan (for twenty years) </li> <li>gYung drung dpal bzang (for eighteen years) </li> <li>Thugs rje gling pa (for a few years) </li> <li>gYung drung bstan ’dzin (for three years)</li> <li>bsTan pa rgyal mtshan (for a few years until the Cultural Revolution) </li> </ol><p>The monastery originally comprised of an assembly hall, a kitchen (ja khang), a mchod rten, and a residence for the monks (grwa khang). It had two establishments, one for the ritual cycle of dBal gsas (dbal gsas sgrub grwa) and another for the atonement ritual of the goddess Srid pa rgyal mo (srid rgyal sgrub grwa). It had a giant thangka and a large collection of books including a complete manuscript copy of the Bonpo Kanjur made by Khod po Blo gros thogs med. The monks were required to take their ordination vows at sMan ri Monastery (No.1).</p><p>2) ’Ong gong Monastery was founded by Khod po Blo gros thogs med at lCang log sna.<a href=\"#n34\" name=\"nb34\" class=\"note\">34</a> It started out as a hermitage and gradually expanded into a monastery, but fell into decline owing to an ongoing dispute with Nya mtsho. As a result it was moved to sMug rong dgu rdza brag dkar, but fell into decline again soon after its reconstruction, as two thirds of the monks were converted to Buddhism.</p><p>The remaining monks followed Nyi ma rgyal mtshan, who at that time had returned to ’Dra valley from sMan ri. The site where they settled was called dGe gsar in the local dialect, which probably means dgon gsar, “new monastery”; the ruins of a stupa are still visible. A master of the monastery called A khu Ye shes, rebuilt a ’du khang with four columns and the monastery became known as ’Ong gong. Following is a list of the successive abbots of the monastery until the Cultural Revolution:</p><ol type=\"1\"> <li>dBal ’gugs sKal bzang rgyal mtshan </li> <li>rTogs ldanTshul khrims rnam dag </li> <li>dBal ’dzin bsTan ’dzin dbang rgyal </li> <li>rTogs ldan Sangs rgyas </li> <li>rDzong lu Ye shes </li> <li>A ’be Tshul khrims </li> <li>Ra tsho lcags thar </li> </ol><p>There were about eighty novices and monks at the monastery in the mid-20th century. They were required to go to sMan ri Monastery for three years training and ordination vows.</p><p>3) According to oral tradition, sMong skyid Monastery was founded in the 6th Rab byung (1327-1386) by the three brothers of Khro tshang who travelled from gShen Dar sding Monastery to ’Dra valley in Khams. It was called Glang ’ong. The eldest brother was called gYung drung rgyal mtshan. After a few generations, the monastery was moved to sMong skyid and became known as sMong skyid dgon rnying, the “old sMong skyid Monastery”. Later when it was moved again it was known as both sMong skyid dgon gsar, the “New sMong skyid Monastery”, and Phun tshogs gling. There were forty novices and monks at the monastery. </p><p>In the 1980s, the masters of the three monasteries, sPrul sku Zla ba grags pa, mKhan po bsTan ’dzin nyi ma, mKhan po gYung drung dbang rgyal, mKhan zur ’Chi med, mKhan po Lo thar, Wa lo mGon po and ’Gyur med agreed to rebuild the three monasteries together as one monastery. The reconstruction was completed in 1989.<a href=\"#n35\" name=\"nb35\" class=\"note\">35</a> Khyung sras bsTan ’dzin nyi ma is the present mkhan po and Zla ba grags pa (b.1936) is the present khri pa.</p>",
