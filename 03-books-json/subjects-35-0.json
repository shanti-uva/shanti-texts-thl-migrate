A town is larger than a village, and yet usually smallersmaller than a city. The boundaries between towns and cities, however, are complex and fluid.  Towns might typically be in the thousands in terms of population, though in modern times they might as much as the hundreds of thousands. However, these can also be technical terms that are defined differently by different countries. Towns and cities are often differentiated in terms of their administrative governance - towns might be \"unincorporated\" and have government services provided by the larger administrative unit such as a county (though they could also be \"incorporated\"); in contrast, cities might be \"incorporated\" as a legally defined government entity with the capacity to provide government services. But historically, there are may different definitions, such as does a specific settlement have a cathedral, a royal charter, or some other feature.  Cities generally have more developed infrastucture as well.</p>
