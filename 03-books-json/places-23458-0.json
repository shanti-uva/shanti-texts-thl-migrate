It is a two hour’s traverse on horseback from the west side of the hill up to rTse drug Monastery at the top.</p> <p>All around the monastery is a land of great beauty where birds, big cuckoos and small <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">’jon mo</span>, are heard singing. Along the mountains and gorges stretching right and left, there are many legends woven around Ge sar, the King of Gling, and Seng lcam ’brug mo, his wife. There are also numerous tales of the local deities.</p> <p>The monastery was founded by Blo ldan snying po in 1383. It is one of the places blessed by innumerable sages and is often called Shel le rdzong drug. Its formal name is Shel brag gShen bstan Dri med gling. It is regarded as one of the five holy places in the world:</p> <p>“Ri bo rtse lnga, abode of the<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"> mkha’ ’gro</span> in China, </p> <p>rTsa ra’i tsha khang, abode of the<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"> mkha’ ’gro </span>in India,</p> <p>Me tog spungs mdzes, abode of the<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"> mkha’ ’gro</span> in<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"> </span>O rgyan,</p> <p>Bho di, abode of the<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"> mkha’ ’gro </span>in Shambhala, </p> <p>Shel le rdzong drug, abode of the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">mkha’ ’gro </span>in Tibet…”</p> <p>“The hill at the back looks like an elephant lying,</p> <p>With a gem held in its mouth.</p> <p>The hill to the right looks like the rising moon,</p> <p>With little stars in the sky.</p> <p>The hill to the left looks like a snow lion leaping,</p> <p>With turquoise mane on its chin.</p> <p>The mountain range looks like white silk spread…”</p> <p>The monastery is surrounded by many marvelous signs and self-grown objects. Beneath the heap of boulders in front, there is a footprint of sTon pa gShen rab the length of a cubit, which is still visited by devotees. At the back of the monastery is a self-grown statue of rGyal ba rgya mtsho, a miraculous foot print of sTon pa ’Chi med gtsug phud and the self-grown letters A and Ma as evidence of teachings of Buddha having been spread. On a rock regarded as the throne of Bla chen Dran pa nam mkha’ there is a self-grown swastika and a self-grown letter A. To the left of the craggy hill is a self-grown statue of the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">mkha’ ’gro</span> Seng gdong ma. In front of the monastery there is a cemetery called Dul khrod bsil ba gling. Beside it is a large rock resembling a human lying on his back; it is regarded as the seat the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">mkha’ ’gro</span> Seng gdong ma.</p> <p>On the surface of a boulder is a verse that Sangs rgyas gling pa wrote with his fingers, as if he were drawing in mud:</p> <p>“All the virtuous work that I have accomplished</p> <p>with my body, speech and mind in sincerity,</p> <p>I share it with the sentient beings of the three realms,</p> <p>May it aid them all to purify all their misdeeds, and</p> <p>Rapidly obtain Buddhahood, endowed with three perfect bodies!”</p> <p>On the surface of another boulder within an arrow’s range, there are the self-risen letters Ya, Ra, Kha, Sru and A, which can actually be seen. On the surface of the high crag Bon ri, there are clear footprints and letters, around which is a self-grown statue of Khro bo gTso mchog mkha’ ’gyings and a statue and a mandala of Sangs rgyas sman bla. Moreover, in rTa rgyas<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"> </span>rdzong, there is a cave of Gyim tsha rma chung with a spring in the middle of it, a self-grown conch on the peak of Shel brag dri med dngos dga’, and caves of Dran pa nam mkha’, Tshe dbang rig ’dzin, Padma ’byung gnas and Blo ldan snying po.</p> <p>Blo ldan snying po, founder of the monastery, was of the dBra clan. He was born in 1360 in Khyung po. From childhood he naturally displayed cleverness and dexterousness unlike other children. He quickly mastered writing and reading. He was such a miraculous one that he inspired awe and respect in the minds of the people at the first sight of him. He met the scholar Rin chen blo gros, and in his presence took monastic vows and was given the name dBra btsun Nam mkha’ rin chen. He became an eminent scholar versed in Sutra, Tantra and Mind.</p> <p>In a vision, he received an oral transmission, which he wrote down, filling fifty-five volumes. They are about the Bon doctrine and the deeds of sTon pa gShen rab, such as the following works on Sutra: <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">Dri med gzi brjid</span> in twelve volumes,<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"> mTshan mdo</span> in six volumes, <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">lHun po brtsegs mdo</span>, <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">bKra shis dal ’bar khab</span> and <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">Ma tri rin chen sgron ma</span>. There were also works on Tantra: <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">dBal gsas rtsod zlog</span>, <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">Phur pa spyi ’dul gshed dmar</span>, <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">gSang mchog rig pa khu byug</span> and <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">Thabs chen mkha’ rgyud</span>. He wrote other works on Dran pa nam mkha’, the local deities of the place, as well as various religious songs (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">mgur</span>) and instructions (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">zhal gdams</span>).</p> <p>He had a number of statues and stupas made, as well as a copy of the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">Khams chen</span> in gold. He practised meditation in other sacred places, such as Bya ze yang rdzong.</p> <p>His close disciples were sGo rigs rGyal mtshan ’od zer and ’Be tsha Grags rgyal. Other disciples were Khyung po Yon rin, sTogs ldan Nam mkha’ rin chen of A ba, rGya ra bSam gtan rgyal mtshan, rGya po Rin chen ’od zer rgyal mtshan, Gru zhig Nam mkha’ ’od zer and La dpyil rGyal mtshan ’od zer. Having completed these deeds, Blo ldan snying po passed away.</p> <p>The reincarnation of Blo ldan snying po was Mi shig rdo rje, who produced fifteen volumes<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"> </span>of writings on Bon doctrines, including the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">sNyan brgyud zhi khro dgongs ’dus</span>.</p> <p>The Third Blo ldan snying po was Sangs rgyas gling pa, who greatly developed rTse drug Monastery. His benefactors were the chiefs of Khyung dkar, Khyung nag and Khyung ser in the Khyung po region. He was invited to go to rGyal rong by the king of dGe bshes. In rGyal rong he gave teachings to the people. When he was about to return to rTse drug Monastery, he was invited to the hall rNam rgyal khang bzang in the palace of the dGe bshe king. The king gave him the following gifts: an image of rGyal ba rgya mtsho that uttered words by itself, a pair of dragon-figured cymbals and a bronze gong named Khro chen dgu ’phar ma. The king also called on thirty young men to be ordained and become monks of rTse drug Monastery. The king of Brag steng gave Sangs rgyas gling pa the following gifts: thirty pairs of cymbals and thirty pairs of little flat bells of the Bon tradition. The king of Rab brtan gave him a large pair of cymbals named lHa mo rang grags and another called Srid pa rang grags, a large flat bell, canopies called rTa rgyugs ma and Khyung lnga ma, and the curtain called Seng thod ma. The Chinese emperors gave him large plaques (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">pan</span>), on which there were words in Chinese characters written in gold.</p> <p>Sangs rgyal gling pa, who was venerated by all, wrote many works, which are in two categories. First, the Oral Traditions he received, which are as follows: <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">gNas brtan bcu drug</span>, <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">gSang mchog rol pa</span>, <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">Dran pa bdud ’dul</span>, <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">Gu ru zhi drag</span>, <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">Tshe dbang g-yung drung</span>, <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">Gur khang, sTag la</span>, and <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">rDzong ’phrang le’u gsum pa</span>.

He gave up eating food, yet lived on at rTse drug for a long time. He established the hermitage of Gyim shod yang dben mthong grol near the monastery.</p> <p>In 1926, Nyag gter gSang sngags gling pa was invited to the monastery. He rediscovered various texts from the cave called Seng ge g-yu rtse and he established in the monastery the “religious dance of the 10th day” and the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">sman sgrub</span> ceremony. On this occasion there were over five hundred monks and nuns, a larger number of pilgrims, plus the local people all gathered together. The number of Bonpo pilgrims and spectators rose to nearly one hundred thousand.</p> <p>In 1934, Kun grol hum chen ’Gro ’dul gling pa was invited to the monastery. On this occasion, when he gave teachings concerning the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">Zhi khro</span>, there were people from Hor, Khyung po and Tsha ba rong; about 700 monks and nuns came to listen.</p> <p>The monastery also invited Khyung nag Tshul khrims phun tshogs - a disciple of ’Ja’ lus pa Shar rdza bKra shis rgyal mtshan - who gave extensive teachings there and initiated the making of copies of the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">bKa’ ’gyur</span> and <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">bKa’ brten,</span> consisting of five hundred volumes, and paintings of more than fifty thangka of the life of Sangs rgyas gling pa; as well, he initiated the restoration of temples. His disciples were Phun tshogs dbang rgyal, Tshul khrims dar rgyas, bSod nams blo gros dbang gi rgyal po (the fifth rebirth of Sangs rgyas gling pa), Gar dbang rNam rgyal gYung drung rgyal mtshan and Tshul khrims rnam rgyal.</p> <p>gYung drung bstan pa’i rgyal mtshan and Tshul khrims rnam rgyal are presently resident in the monastery. They have set up a new monastic school there, in which they have established the practice of meditation based on the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">Che mchog dran pa drag po</span>, and the performance of the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">tshogs ’khor</span> ceremony on the 10th, 15th and 22nd day of every month.

Gar dbang rNam rgyal and his associates began to take an interest in the teachings of Shar rdza bKra shis rgyal mtshan. They began to unify various meditation establishments in the monastery and appointed Khyung nag Tshul khrims phun tshogs as the head of the monastery. Then a new meditation centre was established, where the new head of the monastery began to give teachings based the “Five <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">mDzod</span>” of Shar rdza bKra shis rgyal mtshan.

Besides those who had responsibility in the monastery, there were other lamas who had to make visits to the branch monasteries twice a year in order to see if the monastic codes were observed; others appointed monk officials, exchanged offerings and performed rituals for the people and for the dead. The other duty of these monastic officials was to collect donations.</p> <p>This monastery’s main sources of revenue were its manors - brDa shes, Kha lung, Wa dge, sPra kho, sBa nag and Brang rtswa thang - which produced as much as 250 <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">khal</span> of seed, and Upper and Lower rTa shod in dKar smad, Kha lung and Wa dge, from which they received payment for the rituals of rain-bringing and protection from drought and hail.</p> <p>The total grain earning of the monastery was: from Bam sting, Bal tho, Shog lnga, and Chu gzhung. The monastery also received gifts such as rape-oil. When the year’s harvest was bad the monastery lent about 500 <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">’bo</span> of grain to the villages below the monastery, such as Wa dge, for which it received interest.</p> <p>In brDa shes and other places, the monastery possessed real estate with animals for ploughing, seventy or eighty <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">mdzo mo</span> for dairy purposes and about forty horses and mules for transport.</p> <p>Two families of herdsmen kept the monastery’s 180-plus yaks and <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">’bri</span>, and one hundred goats and sheep. In the nomad areas, such as dNgul phug, ’Gis nang, Om thog kha and brDa ris mda’, the monastery had nomadic people called Thab gsos dud gsum who provided much of the annual expenditure, such as butter for making butter-lamp offerings.</p> <p>The material revenue of the abbot and high lamas covered the cost of living for about forty monks.</p> <p>As for the great hermits in the caves of Mu cho ldem drug, Dran pa nam mkha’, Tshe dbang rig ’dzin, Pad ma ’byung gnas and Blo ldan snying po, they were customarily supported by the well-off families, such as the chiefs of dKar stod, dKar smad, sGar khang, Bya ze, and Nag ru.</p> <p>Before 1959, there were about five hundred monks in this monastery. At present there are six lamas, including Gar dbang rNam rgyal, and about 210 monks. This monastery has an assembly hall with thirty-six pillars, gSer gdung khang, a meditation hall, a college building and other buildings, all of which are adorned with excellent interiors. The main religious objects, of immense value, are as follows: the word-uttering statue of Jo bo nga ’gro, which, having been hidden by many lay and clerical devotees during the Cultural Revolution, was presented to the monastery; a cubit-high statue of Kun bzang rGyal ba rgya mtsho made of <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">rdzi gim</span>; a pair of large and small conchs, which are the transformations of gShen rab’s teeth and his melodic voice; a blue statue of Pad ma ’od ’bar; a statue of gShen lha ’od dkar made of pure gold; a statue of sTon pa Khri gtsug rgyal ba; a statue of Rig ’dzin Dran pa bdud ’dul; a bronze statue of Phur pa ten cubits high; and a seal of Dran pa nam mkha’. All of these can still be seen in the monastery.</p> <p>Annual services and rituals are performed according to the age-old tradition. In particular, in 1984, there was the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">sman sgrub</span> medicine ceremony based on the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">dBal phur ’od zer ’khyil ba’i sman sgrub</span>, during which as many as eighteen thousand lay and clerical devotees from Hor, Shog lnga, Lam lha, Khyung dkar, Khyung nag, Khyung ser, lHa ru and Bag sre crowded into rTse drug Monastery in order to receive initiation and the “medicine” distributed at the time, as well as to enjoy the religious dances. All who gathered there made the festival a great occasion.</p> "}]}
