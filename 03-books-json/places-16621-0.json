The site, which is elevated 100 m above the village of <span class=\"popular\">Gobuk<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Mgo sbug<\/span>, is in direct view of <span class=\"popular\">Namtso<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Gnam mtsho<\/span> situated 10 km to the south. Small springs are found in the vicinity of this lone residential structure. The well-built granite edifice (4.8 m x 7.5 m) has been largely reduced to fragmentary footings. It appears to have been split between two elevations (there is a 30 cm vertical difference between them). There may have been only one room in each of the two tiers. No standing walls remain at <span class=\"popular\">Khangp\u00e9 Ky\u00e9<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Khang pa\u2019i skyed<\/span>. The rear wall was built 60 cm into the slope. To the southeast of the structure there are the remains of footings, suggesting hat a walled courtyard once stood here. It appears to have been 7.5 m long and the width of the building itself. The courtyard was set about 70 cm below the lower tier of rooms. Foundation walls are of a random-rubble texture and contain large stones (30 cm to 1 m long). The ground plan of the edifice, its heavy wall traces and the presence of granite members up to 1.4 m in length on the site suggest that it was of all-stone construction. Next o the ruined edifice there is a <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma \u1e47i<\/span> wall with highly worn inscribed plaques that are likely to date to the time of the early <span class=\"popular emph\">Kagy\u00fcpa<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">bka\u2019 brgyud pa<\/span> masters. The impression received is that some of the archaic cultural ruin was dismantled o build this Buddhist monument, probably in order to pacify and requisition the site.
