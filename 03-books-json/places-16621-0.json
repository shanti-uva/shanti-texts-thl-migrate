The site, which is elevated 100 m above the village of <span class=\"popular\">Gobuk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mgo sbug</span>, is in direct view of <span class=\"popular\">Namtso</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gnam mtsho</span> situated 10 km to the south. Small springs are\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfound in the vicinity of this lone residential structure. The well-built granite edifice (4.8 m x 7.5 m) has been\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlargely reduced to fragmentary footings. It appears to have been split between two elevations (there is a 30 cm\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvertical difference between them). There may have been only one room in each of the two tiers. No standing walls\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tremain at <span class=\"popular\">Khangp&eacute; Ky&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Khang pa&rsquo;i skyed</span>. The rear wall\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twas built 60 cm into the slope. To the southeast of the structure there are the remains of footings, suggesting\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat a walled courtyard once stood here. It appears to have been 7.5 m long and the width of the building itself.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe courtyard was set about 70 cm below the lower tier of rooms. Foundation walls are of a random-rubble texture\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand contain large stones (30 cm to 1 m long). The ground plan of the edifice, its heavy wall traces and the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpresence of granite members up to 1.4 m in length on the site suggest that it was of all-stone construction. Next\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto the ruined edifice there is a <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma &#7751;i</span> wall with highly worn\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinscribed plaques that are likely to date to the time of the early <span class=\"popular emph\">Kagy&uuml;pa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">bka&rsquo; brgyud pa</span> masters. The impression received is that some of the archaic cultural ruin was dismantled\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto build this Buddhist monument, probably in order to pacify and requisition the site. An\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tarchaic cultural identity is best in keeping with the morphological and locational characteristics of <span class=\"popular\">Khangp&eacute; Ky&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Khang pa&rsquo;i skyed</span>. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>None appears to exist in nearby <span class=\"popular\">Gobuk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mgo sbug</span> village.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf <span class=\"popular\">Khangp&eacute; Ky&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Khang pa&rsquo;i skyed</span> was indeed a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBuddhist site, some recognition of its religious status is likely to have been preserved.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n"}]}
