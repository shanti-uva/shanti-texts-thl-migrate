The seat of Nyag rong county is Ri nang, located\n                  at Ri nang pasture in Nyag rong valley. There are ninety-two villages divided\n                  between twenty-four townships.

The Bonpo scholar and historian Shar rdza bKra shis rgyal\n                        mtshan (1858-1934) also mentions this personage in his historical work.<a href=\"#n13\" name=\"nb13\" class=\"note\">13</a> It is also said that Me nyag sTag gsas and rMa lHa rgod of Nyag rong\n                        are in fact one and the same. There is a prayer text entitled Lo rgyus gsol\n                        &rsquo;debs (MS) in Ye shes Monastery mentioning that &ldquo;the great and powerful hero\n                        Me nyag sTag gsas came to Me nyag under the name of rMa gsas lHa rgod&rdquo;.<a href=\"#n14\" name=\"nb14\" class=\"note\">14</a>\n                     </p>\n\n                     <p>The son of rMa lHa rgod was called Nam mkha&rsquo; ye shes. He received teachings\n                        from his father and then travelled extensively to propagate the Bon\n                        religion. He won the esteem and support of Klu rgyal, the chief of Nyag rong\n                        who helped him build a monastery at Brag dmar mdo rtsa in his honour. The\n                        monastery was named Ye shes Monastery after him. Since the monastery\n                        consisted of temples (lha khang), the place became known as Lha khang thang,\n                        the &ldquo;plain of temples&rdquo;.</p>\n\n                     <p>Three generations of Nyag rong chiefs acted as patrons of Nam mkha&rsquo; ye shes:\n                        Klu rgyal, his son Klu mgon and his grandson Klu skyabs.<a href=\"#n15\" name=\"nb15\" class=\"note\">15</a> Nam mkha&rsquo; ye shes was succeeded by Cang mkhar spo sByin pa rgyal\n                           mtshan<a href=\"#n16\" name=\"nb16\" class=\"note\">16</a> who spent the first half of his life in Ye shes Monastery, and then\n                        left the monastery to live in a hermitage which he founded on a hill called\n                        Dar ri, which is why he is also locally known as Dar ri sByin pa rgyal\n                        mtshan. Although Rig &rsquo;dzin nyi ma does give precise dates in his historical\n                        work with regard to the masters mentioned above, I am not sure they are\n                        accurate and prefer not to use them here.<a href=\"#n17\" name=\"nb17\" class=\"note\">17</a>\n                     </p>\n\n                     <p>Because Klu thar had no male heirs, the lineage of local chiefs was\n                        discontinued. </p>\n\n                     <p>There was also a master called rTogs ldan bKra shis rgyal mtshan who became\n                        a famous ascetic in the area; he is also known as Nub rTogs ldan bKra shis\n                        rgyal mtshan. His brother, Mo the<a href=\"#n18\" name=\"nb18\" class=\"note\">18</a> Tshul khrims rgyal mtshan, was a lay tantric practictioner and\n                        founded sKya thu li temple at La rked stod and gShel lo temple at La rked\n                        smad in Nyag rong; because he was very active in La sked, he was also known\n                        as Nyag sked tshang, and it is said that his lineage continued to be active\n                        in the area for seventeen generations. </p>\n\n                     <p>During the time of mGon po rnam rgyal, a chief of Nyag rong, gSang mchog, a\n                        descendent of Khod spungs sGrub gshen snang ldan, Zla ba grags pa, a\n                        descendent of Mo the lineage, gYung drung rgyal mtshan, a son of &rsquo;Od zer\n                        gling pa, and Nyag stod sTong ldan mgon po, agreed to rebuild Ye shes\n                        Monastery in which three small monasteries were merged as one monastery.</p>\n\n                     <p>Later Nyag stod sTong ldan mgon po acted as a patron of the monastery and\n                        renamed it Ye shes bshad sgrub gling. According to Rig &rsquo;dzin nyi ma this\n                        took place in 1848.<a href=\"#n19\" name=\"nb19\" class=\"note\">19</a> In 1908, Shar rdza bKra shis rgyal mtshan visited the monastery. In\n                        1909, Khyung po Nyi ma rgyal mtshan and Tshul khrims mchog rgyal added an\n                        assembly hall (&rsquo;du khang) with twelve columns. Both were disciples of Shar\n                        rdza bKra shis rgyal mtshan. Nyi ma rgyal mtshan had two sons, gYung drung\n                        bdud &rsquo;dul and Ri kho alias Thugs rje gling pa. The former succeeded him\n                        after his death. The latter discovered numerous gter ma texts in several\n                        places in Khams and taught them throughout the area. </p>\n\n                     <p>During the Cultural Revolution the monastery was destroyed, but its\n                        reconstruction was undertaken in 1983 with the help of A yung, alias gYung\n                        drung bstan pa&rsquo;i rgyal mtshan (1922-1996). In his youth, he was recognized\n                        as the reincarnation of a master called Dri med &rsquo;od zer, and the abbot of\n                        the monastery,Tshul khrims mchog rgyal, kept him in the monastery. In fact\n                        the abbot was a brother of his grandfather. He studied under the abbot, gTer\n                        ston Tshe dbang &rsquo;gyur med, dBra ston bsKal bzang bstan pa&rsquo;i rgyal mtshan\n                           (1897-1959)<a href=\"#n20\" name=\"nb20\" class=\"note\">20</a> (10) and rGyal tshab Blo gros rgyal mtsho. </p>\n\n                     <p>Later A yung became vice-president of the Political Consultative Conference\n                        of dKar mdzes Prefecture, and it was in this capacity he was able to help to\n                        rebuild Ye shes Monastery and other local Bonpo monasteries. He worked hard\n                        to promote education in Bonpo monasteries in dKar mdzes Prefecture. When I\n                        visited dKar mdzes Prefecture in 1997, I saw his photograph in almost every\n                        monastery. I then realized how popular he was among the Bonpo community. </p>\n\n                     <p>In the 1980s, a manuscript copy the Bonpo Kanjur was brought out at dBal\n                        khyung Monastery. It was hidden away during the turbulent history. As it\n                        turned out, it was the only complete extant copy of the Bonpo Canon. Its\n                        publication, owing to the strenuous efforts of A yung and his friend Shug\n                        sdong sKal bzang phun tshogs, represents a major contribution to Tibetan\n                        cultural heritage, although the published version is not an exact replica of\n                        the dBal khyung manuscript. Alongside A yung, another important figure of\n                        the monastery was the master gYung drung bdud &rsquo;dul (?-1995). </p>\n\n                     <p>In 1983, the authorities granted the monastery permission to reopen. Thanks\n                        to A yung and gYung drung bdud &rsquo;dul, and the financial support and labour\n                        provided by the local lay community, the monastery was rebuilt and is now\n                        one of the most important centres in the region.

He is believed to have discovered a number of\n                        holy objects on the sacred site including a statue of White Tara and a gold\n                        gshang bell. He donated these objects to Gong rgyal Monastery. Around that\n                        time the monastery had about one hundred monks. In the Wood-Bird Year of the\n                        15th Rab byung (1885), Bya btang bsTan pa&rsquo;i nyi ma undertook to build a new\n                        temple for the monastery following a plan made by gSang sngags gling pa.\n                        When it was completed two years later, gSang sngags gling pa was invited to\n                        consecrate it and to give the lung initiation of the Bonpo Kanjur. Later,\n                        other masters such as Shar rdza bKra shis rgyal mtshan, Khro sprul gYung\n                        drung mthong grol and the fifth Kun grol bDud &rsquo;dul gling pa also gave\n                        teachings at the monastery. </p>\n\n                     <p>The Gong rgyal dgon gyi lo rgyus (anonymous, MS) lists twenty-two successive\n                        masters of the Bya btang lineage until the middle of the 20th century: </p>\n\n                     <ol type=\"1\">\n                        <li>Nam mkha&rsquo; rgyal mtshan </li>\n\n                        <li>Nam mkha&rsquo; dbang ldan </li>\n\n                        <li>Ye shes rgyal mtshan </li>\n\n                        <li>gYung drung gsas pa </li>\n\n                        <li>bKra shis rgyal mtshan </li>\n\n                        <li>sDa dbon Nam mkha&rsquo; thog sdug </li>\n\n                        <li>sDa dbon Nam mkha&rsquo; rgyal mtshan </li>\n\n                        <li>Grags pa ye shes </li>\n\n                        <li>Tshe dbang bkra shis </li>\n\n                        <li>Shes rab bstan &rsquo;dzin </li>\n\n                        <li>bSod nams blo gros </li>\n\n                        <li>bSod nams &rsquo;od zer </li>\n\n                        <li>sDa dbon Rin chen blo ldan </li>\n\n                        <li>Zha bo zhabs ma Nyi ma grags pa </li>\n\n                        <li>sDa dbon sMon lam tshul khrims </li>\n\n                        <li>bsTan &rsquo;dzin dbang grags </li>\n\n                        <li>gYung drung rgyal mtshan </li>\n\n                        <li>Tshul khrims rgyal mtshan </li>\n\n                        <li>gYung drung bstan pa&rsquo;i nyi ma </li>\n\n                        <li>Dri med &rsquo;od zer </li>\n\n                        <li>Tshe dbang &rsquo;gyur med </li>\n\n                        <li>gShen bstan rgyal mtshan </li>\n                     </ol>\n\n                     <p>With Bya btang bsTan &rsquo;dzin dbang grags&rsquo;s two sons, the lineage divided into\n                        two branches. There are two versions of the history about when reincarnation\n                        was adopted for the succession of the Bya btang masters. According to one,\n                        the position continued to be hereditary (gdung brgyud) until Tshe dbang\n                        &rsquo;gyur med&rsquo;s time in the middle of the 20th century, after which it was\n                        transmitted by reincarnation. However, when I visited the monastery in 1997,\n                        I was told that the reincarnation system was adopted after Bya btang gYung\n                        drung rgyal mtshan&rsquo;s time. So far, because of the lack of reliable Sources\n                        it has been impossible to verify either versions of the story.

As a result the village split into two villages: sGre bo stod and sGre\n                        bo smad.
