The nine all-stone residential structures of phug dgu chu gsum are all more or less aligned in the cardinal directions and face in a southerly direction. This probable ancient religious site is extremely remote and seldom visited; although at one time it may have housed more that 50 residents. The <span class=\"popular emph\">do khang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rdo khang</span>, while not well preserved, were superbly constructed from red stone. The rooms were generally small (around 4 m²) as is typical in all-stone corbelled edifices. The robustly constructed random-rubble slab walls are approximately 50 cm thick. A dark-colored rock of variable-length (up to 1 m long) was used in construction. Corbels and bridging stones up to 1.5 m in length are scattered all around the site. </p> "},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":" <p> phug dgu chu gsum is reported by local residents to be an ancient religious center.</p> "},{"title":"Site elements","index":6,"parent_index":2,"body":" "},{"title":"rDo khang complex","index":7,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p> <span class=\"popular emph\">do khang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rdo khang</span> RS1 and RS2 are situated at the bottom end of the site.

The east half of the <span class=\"popular emph\">do khang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rdo khang</span> has been felled to its foundations. Near the east wall a tabular stone is planted in the ground. This <span class=\"popular emph\">Doring</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rdo ring</span> was broken and is now only 45 cm in height (basal girth of 1.1 m). Perhaps the standing stone marked the establishment of the building, like at certain Lamaist sites. On the eastern half of the rear/north wall a large corbel protrudes 70 cm over the internal space. The rear wall was set 1 m to 1.2 m into the slope. A partition wall with a maximum height of 1.2 m divides the east and west halves of RS1. There is a small niche in the west side of the partition wall. In the west half of the structure there is a north-south oriented partition wall remnant. </p> "},{"title":"Residential Structure RS2","index":9,"parent_index":7,"body":" <p>Residential structure RS2 is located 16 m east of RS1. This large structure measures 17 m (east-west) x 7 m (north-south). On the west end of the ruin there is both a forward and rear room. In the west wall of this forward or south room there is a niche, and there is a niche in the rear wall of the rear west room as well. In the rear west room and the adjacent rear room there are corbels and bridging stones clinging to the rear wall. The portion of the outer rear wall in this area is built 1.6 m into the ground. The entranceway between these two rear rooms is intact (1.2 m x 50 cm). East of these two rear rooms, the rear tier of the <span class=\"popular emph\">do khang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rdo khang </span>appears to have been comprised of one relatively large room. The east section of the rear wall is not so well preserved and extends 1 m or less into the slope. Adjacent to the forward west room there is another forward room that has collapsed. Among the detritus of this room are sheathing slabs up to 2 m in length. East of this collapsed room there is another forward room with an intact entranceway (1.1 m x 80 cm). At 1.8 m, its north wall is the highest remaining fragment at RS2.

This masonry base (3 m x 3.2 m) is best preserved on the west side where it is 1.4 m in height. Straight walls rise above a broader 40 cm high basal section. There is no evidence of a <span class=\"popular emph\">bhumpa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">bum pa</span> or any other kind of superstructure. It was constructed of dark bluish slabs that have weathered to a red color, 20 cm to 60 cm in length and 2 cm to 8 cm in thickness. These stones were laid in random-work, dry-mortar courses. On the south side of this cubic structure there is a wall 9 m in length, which has been reduced to 50 cm in height. This wall appears to have been originally around 1 m thick. Another wall links the big shrine to a smaller shrine situated 8 m to the north. This linking wall has been almost obliterated and the smaller shrine is very poorly preserved. The inscribed plaques found at the site are all highly eroded and feature the <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma ṇi</span> mantra. </p> <p>A 1-m high plaque partially submerged in the soil sits in the shrine complex. This plaque features a standing <span class=\"popular\">Chenrezik</span><span class=\"scholar\">Spyan ras gzigs</span> (Avalokiteśvara) figure adeptly carved in shallow relief. It appears to date to the period of the second Buddhist diffusion (<span class=\"popular emph\">tenpa chidar</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">bstan pa phyi dar</span>). This highly worn relief plaque of Tibet’s patron deity documents the Buddhist occupation of phug dgu chu gsum as early as one millennium ago. The implication of this Buddhist artifact may be that the residential facility, after first being established by archaic religious practitioners, was reoccupied by the Buddhists. This reoccupation was probably nominal given the extreme elevation of the site. Moreover, no fixed Buddhist emblems are found near the <span class=\"popular emph\">do khang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rdo khang</span>.</p> <p>The <span class=\"popular\">Chenrezik</span><span class=\"scholar\">Spyan ras gzigs</span> bas relief image is ornamented with two necklaces, earrings and a five-diadem crown. The figure is attired in an Indian style skirt and holds the stem of a lotus in each hand. Below the deity, a butter lamp (<span class=\"popular emph\">Marmé</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mar me</span>) and sacrificial cake (<span class=\"popular emph\">Torma</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">gtor ma</span>) were carved and lower on the plaque, swirling lines represent the world ocean. Above the deity’s head the sun is on the right side and the moon on the left side. Also, on the left side of the deity, a vertically oriented inscription reads: <span class=\"popular emph\">jo bo ti zang po la na mo</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">jo bo ti bzang po la na mo</span>, and on its right side there is the inscription: <span class=\"popular emph\">Om A Hum</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">oṃ a hum</span>. <span class=\"popular\">Jowoti Zangpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Jo bo ti bzang po</span> is an old Upper Tibetan manifestation of spyan ras gzings. </p>  "}]}
