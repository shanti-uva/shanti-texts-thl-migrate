The ancient stronghold consists of two light-colored limestone formations that stand side by side.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTheir upper flanks are crisscrossed by defensive walls.

The serpentine defensive walls were established at various elevations along the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tprecipitous south side of the twin limestone formations. The extensive random-work, probably dry-mortar defensive\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twalls are built of slabs of stone up to 1 m in length. The level areas created behind the ramparts must have\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfunctioned as temporary living and working quarters, as well as for defense. By circumscribing the limestone\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmounts with walls, the defenders were able to move around in relative ease and could direct their salvos\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\taccordingly.

Along the near vertical southwest side of the summit, a defensive wall was probably not required. Within\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthese walls there is what appears to be the foundation of a small building (4.6 m x 3.8 m); its wall footings\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tare 75 cm thick and up to 1.2 m in height. What may be another building foundation (5.4 m x 4 m) is located just\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbelow the west side of the summit, and was built against a rock face. Only walls 50 cm or less in height have\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpersisted among these footings. Approximately 20 m below the summit, a defensive wall (60 m long) encircles the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tentire south flank of the formation. Small segments, however, are missing. This rampart is a maximum of 1.5 m\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thigh on its down-slope side and usually flush with the uphill side of the formation.
