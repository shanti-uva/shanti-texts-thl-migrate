Golok was comprised of three main parts (mgo log khag gsum): Akyong Bum (a skyong &rsquo;bum), Wangchen Bum (dbang chen &rsquo;bum), and Pema Bum (pad ma &rsquo;bum). Each one of these parts was like an umbrella with further divisions, each with their own leaders, and then subdivisions beyond those. Akyong Bum included five different divisions (tsho khag) with their own leaders (dpon), which themselves governed up to three different communities: the nomadic community (ru sde), farming community (rong sde), and outer community (phyi sde), which referred to groups of people who had been incorporated into the Golok fold but were originally outsiders.<a name=\"n7\" href=\"#fn7\">[7]<\/a> Similarly, Wangchen Bum included an upper and lower division, from which multiple layers of subdivisions came forth. Listing these by their Tibetan names in the order of larger to smaller, Wangchen Bum&rsquo;s subdivisions included: ru ma >ru sde or phyi sde > shog chung or tsho shog or tsho ba > tsho ma lag > tsho yang lag. Thirdly, Pema Bum was divided into eight different principalities (<em>dpon khag<\/em>) each governed by their own leader. These principalities contained different communities (sde ba) each with multiple encampment circles (tsho khor) or groups of ten households (bcu shog). As is evident by this overview of the breakdown of Golok society, Golok was not a monolithic entity but rather a collection of communities ranging in size and power. Internal disputes over rights to pasture land and other vendettas were (and still are) commonplace, but in the face of a common external enemy, the three parts of Golok were able to organize and mobilize an army with alacrity.<\/p> "},{"title":"Political History","index":6,"parent_index":0,"body":null},{"title":"References","index":7,"parent_index":0,"body":" <p>Don grub dbang rgyal and Nor sde, <em>Yul go log gi lo rgyus deb ther padma dkar po&rsquo;i chun po<\/em>.
