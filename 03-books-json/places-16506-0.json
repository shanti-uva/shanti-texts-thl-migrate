The site is located where the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tplain bounding the southeast side of the lake shrinks to a thin strip of rocky land, just north of a small valley\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcalled <span class=\"popular\">Tratsang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Khra tshang</span> (Hawk&rsquo;s Nest).

It consists of two groups of ramparts: one on\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe summit and one below it on the west side of the formation.

The series of small protective walls clinging to the formation appear to be an archaic\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tarchitectural feature, and permanent buildings may not have been established here. The highly deteriorated\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tramparts are covered in orange climax lichen and do not seem to have been disturbed for a long time. They were\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconstructed of random-rubble and may have been dry-mortared, as there is little evidence of adhesive materials in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe joints.

These walls were\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpurposely hidden from view, suggesting that stealth was a major tactical consideration in the use of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinstallation. This concealment was accomplished by setting the walls slightly behind the summit crags and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\texposed south ridgeline. A horizontal south rib of rock and a rocky arm 3 m higher and to the north create a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnaturally sheltered space between them, which was accented by the construction of the walls. Small rock faces\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdivide this zone into several levels.

This site was clearly occupied in more recent centuries. It consists of two main caves and a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsmall building interconnected by a narrow open-air gallery. The gallery is appended to a covered vestibule\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tleading to a small outer courtyard. The single-room building is set on the south side of the complex against a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcliff. Its walls are of random-rubble that is heavily mortared in mud. The roof is fully intact and was entirely\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbuilt of stone in the archaic manner of construction. Finely cut bridging stones were placed upon corbels at\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvarious angles, and stone sheathing laid over them.

Against one wall is an elaborate stone and adobe altar with\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvarious shelves and niches painted in red ochre.
