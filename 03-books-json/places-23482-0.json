In the old days the place was called Rab pa. The distance between the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">rdzong</span> and the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">xiang</span> is no more than sixty kilometres, but it is very difficult to traverse.</p><p>No record concerning the date of establishment of this monastery has remained. Still it is one of the fairly old Bonpo monasteries.</p><p>Before 1959, there were nineteen monks; today there are ten. In the temple there are just a few religious objects, like the statues of sTon pa gShen rab and Yum chen Byams ma. In terms of facilities, it is poorly equipped.</p><p>Rituals are practised in the same manner as those of other Bonpo monasteries. The monks rely mainly on support from their own families for their living and occasionally go out to perform religious services in villages to supplement their income.</p>",
