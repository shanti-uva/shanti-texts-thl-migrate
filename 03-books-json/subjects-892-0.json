Pakmo Drupa was a hermetic figure who lived in a simple meditation hut. It appears that most likely his tradition spawned the greatest number of subdivisions precisely because of his hermetic tendencies, such that the lack of organization combined with his charisma spawned multiple movements in his wake. Thus it is typically divided into eight different suborders founded by various disciples. The Pakdru sect itself eventually petered out as a separate lineage in its own right. It is true that Pakdru's own meditation hut eventually developed into the important monastery of Densa Til (<span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">gdan sa mthil</span>). However his clan, the Pakmo Drupa, developed into important political leaders, and by the time they took over rule of Tibet with Jangchup Gyeltsen (<span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">byang chub rgyal mtshan</span>), most of their leaders had become feudal lords no longer maintaining a distinct monastic lineage.</p>
