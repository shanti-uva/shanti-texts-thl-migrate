Cars can reach the foot of the mountain.<\/p><p>One of the thirty-seven centres of Bon was rKong yul Se mo thang. These centres were established during the time of Mu khri btsan po, a son of gNya\u2019 khri btsan po. It is at Se mo thang in Kong po that Srid rgyal Monastery is located.<\/p><p>The lineage of lamas of this monastery goes back to Ri pa \u2019Brug gsas. He is said to have been the emanation of the tutelary deity sTag la med \u2019bar. A historical document states:<\/p><p>\u201cIn the land called Bon ri<\/p><p>There will be a hermit named \u2019Brug gsas<\/p><p>Who will possess a \u2018magic-stone\u2019,<\/p><p>Will be courageous and avert wars,<\/p><p>And guide 300,000 people to salvation.<\/p><p>Anyone who contacts him will be rewarded.\u201d<\/p><p>This hermit was born in 1270 in rDza rong into the clan of sMa ra. sMa ra is a subdivision of the clan Rang bya. He was the second son of dKon cog dge, the father, and A lcam U gu, the mother. Having been in religious service until the age of thirteen years, he was given the name \u2019Brug gsas rgyal. From the time he was fourteen until he was nineteen years of age, he practised meditation. He then listened to various masters in China, \u2019Jang and Mi nyag. He then became conscious of the impermanence of life. He therefore travelled to Central Tibet and began to practise more meditation, as well as to perform circumambulation around sacred sites such as Ti se, Ma pang, Bye ma g-yung drung and sPos ri ngad ldan. He then travelled down to Kong po in accordance with a prophecy of Srid pa rgyal mo. In 1330, he \u201copened the door of Bon ri\u201d (that is to say, he identified the mountain), because people had forgotten the fact that the place was one of the thirty-seven religious centres of Bon. This was due to the long period of time that passed since sTon pa gShen rab\u2019s visit to the place and also due to the chequered history of the Bon religion.<\/p><p>\u2019Brug gsas took up residence in the cave gYu phug, near which the three streams of Nyang meet. He remained there in meditation for three years and countenanced deities of tranquil and wrathful aspects from whom he received more prophecies. He was able to make the eight kinds of demons serve him. While devoting himself to retreat-practice of Khro bo and Phur pa on the mountain, he received signs from the goddess dKar mo Srid rgyal for founding a monastery at this place. He therefore founded Srid rgyal Monastery there. The interior and exterior of the monastic buildings were of good design and their religious contents were rich. More than one hundred monks from all directions gathered together there.<\/p><p>He left traces of his body and footprints on rocks around the site of the monastery and passed away at the age of eighty. He promised that he would come back in the form of a bird to see the monastery every year on the 13th day of the fourth Tibetan month. A festival called dGon chen Bya mjal was, thereafter, held on this day and it was the occasion when people went to see the bird.<\/p><p>The line of the heads of the monastery was as follows:<\/p><ol type=\"1\"> <li> Ri pa \u2019Brug gsas<\/li> <li> Rag shi Nyi ma rgyal mtshan<\/li> <li> Bru ston Nyi ma rgyal mtshan<\/li> <li> La tri hri rda (Zhang zhung language: Dam pa blo gros)<\/li> <li> sDong sgom bsTan pa lhun grub<\/li> <li> rNal \u2019byor Nam mkha\u2019 lhun grub<\/li> <li> Tshe dbang lhun grub<\/li> <li> bsTan pa rgyal mtshan<\/li> <li> gYung drung rnam rgyal<\/li> <li> Rin chen tshul khrims<\/li> <li> Kun bzang lhun grub<\/li> <li> rGyal ba gtsug phud<\/li> <li> Tshe dbang legs mchog<\/li> <li> gYung drung rgyal mtshan<\/li> <li> rGyal ba blo gros<\/li> <li> Mi \u2019gyur rgyal mtshan<\/li> <li> lHun grub dbang rgyal<\/li> <li> gYung drung dbang rgyal<\/li> <li> Tshe dbang \u2019od zer<\/li> <li> Khyung sprul gYung drung phun tshogs<\/li> <li> Zla ba don \u2019grub<\/li> <li> Tshul khrims blo gros<\/li> <li> mTha\u2019 yas rgya mtsho<\/li> <li> Nor skyabs Rinpoche<\/li> <\/ol><p>Dam pa blo gros, the fourth in the line, founded the monastery called rDzong chung kha. gDong sgom bsTan pa lhun grub, the fifth, founded sTag rtse Monastery (No.89) in his later life. bsTan pa rgyal mthan, the eighth, carried out all the duties delegated to him by sPyan gsal Kun \u2019phel gling, an official serving under the Fifth Dalai Lama (1617-1682). As a reward, the Dalai Lama granted the monastery the special privilege of establishing an independent monastic code, building a rooftop and making a double tamarisk-stems-work on the outer wall of the monastic building. At that time there were four hundred monks in the monastery. Mi \u2019gyur rgyal mtshan, the sixteenth in the line, founded dGyes ri Monastery.
