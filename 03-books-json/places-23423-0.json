Travelling sixty-four kilometres southward from &rsquo;Bri ru rdzong and crossing two mountain passes, one reaches Sen tsha village in gYang shod <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">xiang<\/span>, which lies halfway up the mountain on the north side of the river rGyal chu.<\/p> <p>In its early years, Sen tsha Monastery was situated in the village of Sen tsha itself, but around 1440, Kun dga&rsquo; dbang ldan of the Bru family, who was a disciple of mNyam med Shes rab rgyal mtshan, regarding the recess at the foot of Byug ri phyug mo as auspicious, built a temple there. It is said that there were many auspicious signs when it was built.<\/p> <p>This establishment became a monastery, which had many buildings and blessed religious objects, as well as many lay priests. Many lay priests of gYang shod Mar thang later moved, one after another, into the vicinity of the temple. This caused not only a blurring in the distinction between clergy and laity, but also a serious hindrance to the development of the monastery.<\/p> <p>In 1918, when the great abbot of sMan ri (No.1), sKu &rsquo;dun Phun tshogs blo gros, came to rGyal shod, he decided to transfer the monastery in accordance with the plan made by the lord of Sen tsha, bSod nams lha rgyal, and others. However, there was slight internal discord at that decision. Therefore, in order to avoid the merging of monks and lay priests, a monastery called Phun tshogs glang chen &rsquo;gying ri spo ra dgon rNam rgyal kun grags gling was established.<\/p> <p>The monastery&rsquo;s religious objects at that time included the following: a statue of sTon pa gShen rab within which was a relic of his body as big as a skylark egg, the reliquary stupa of Khyung btsun bSam gtan nyi ma, several bigger clay statues, scriptures written in gold on a black ground, a treasure-trove consisting of such items as a helmet and a coat of mail, and many scriptures, including a complete set of the <em xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\">bKa&rsquo; &rsquo;gyur<\/em> and <em xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\">bKa&rsquo; brten<\/em>.<\/p> <p>The youngest son of bSod nams lha rgyal, the chief of Sen tsha, was ordained in the presence of the abbot, sKu &rsquo;dun Phun tshogs blo gros, and was given the name Tshul khrims rgya mtsho. He was esteemed as the head of the institution, which then became a veritable monastery. In order to collect donations, Tshul khrims rgyal mtsho travelled to the nomad area of Hor, where there was a good number of contributors, which was useful for the subsistence of the monastery. His paternal lineage was in the Zhu family, which had branched from the family of the rDzum chief. He kept a close patron-priest relationship with Hor, hence the alternate name of the monastery, Sen tsha Zhu tshang gYang shod dgon.<\/p> "},{"title":"Religious services and practice of rituals","index":3,"parent_index":2,"body":" <p>The rituals mainly practised in this monastery were divided into two sections: rituals based on the <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">rNam rgyal<\/span> and <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">Klong rgyas<\/span> of the non-Tantric section and the <span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">dBal gsas zhi drag<\/span> of the Tantric section and the propitiatory texts for the religious Bon protectors, especially the deity Brag btsan A bse.<\/p> <p>The main annual religious services were the chanting of the ritual cycles of Khro bo, dBal gsas and Phur pa.
