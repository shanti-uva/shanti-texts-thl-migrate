The site has an eastern aspect, overlooking a vast plain that\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tterminates near the sacred mountain, <span class=\"popular\">kyungka</span><span class=\"scholar\">Skyung ka</span>.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe terrain is generally grassy and with a slope gradient of around 10&deg;. <span class=\"popular\">Gokri</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sgog ri</span> is situated only about 2 km east of <span class=\"popular\">Mig&ouml;n Ch&ouml;nyi</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mi mgon chos nyid</span> (D-81), and shares the same topographic and morphological traits\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tas this site. As such, these two sites are culturally and chronologically closely related. There are 19 terraced\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfunerary structures at <span class=\"popular\">Gokri</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sgog ri</span>, which form a long\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trow along the base of the hill. These consist mostly of larger rectangular specimens (50 m&sup2; to 100 m&sup2;). The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tterraced funerary structures of <span class=\"popular\">Gokri</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sgog ri</span> are built\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin the same fashion as other examples of the typology (II.2e) in the far eastern <span class=\"popular\">Jangtang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Byang thang</span>. The forward/downhill sides of the structures are elevated as\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmuch as 2 m above the lower slope, while rear walls are generally flush with the slope. The two long walls of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthese flat-topped structures are oriented perpendicular to the axis of the slope. With few exceptions, stones\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twithout any discernable pattern or arrangement line the forward flank and the two sides of each structure.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHowever, the deliberate stacking of stones is also encountered. In quite a few larger specimens there are rear\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twall traces flush with the uphill slope or slightly elevated above it. Most, if not all, of the structures are\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfree from structural elements situated inside the outer walls. Variable-length (20 cm to 60 cm long), grayish\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvolcanic (?) rocks were used in construction. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Some of the terraced funerary structures have depressions on top, giving the impression that they were excavated\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tat one time. It is also possible, however, that these concavities were formed through subsidence and/or erosion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFortunately, the monuments of <span class=\"popular\">Gokri</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sgog ri</span> do not\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tappear to have been disturbed recently. The largest terraced funerary structure of <span class=\"popular\">Gokri</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sgog ri</span> is designated funerary structure FS9 (12 m x 8.5 m). The upper portion\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof its forward flank consists of four vertical courses of stones forming a wall, 50 cm in height. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>None was collected.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n"}]}
