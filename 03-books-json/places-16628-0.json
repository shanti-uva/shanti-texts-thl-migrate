A large collection of all-stone edifices\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tare situated near the base of the slope that encloses the north side of the broad <span class=\"popular\">Sar&#257;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sa r&#257;</span> valley. The movement of scree slopes combined with flooding has taken a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\theavy toll on the site. The various dispersions found here represent the onetime existence of no less than 50 or\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t60 buildings. It is certainly possible that several hundred people once lived at <span class=\"popular\">Sar&#257;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sa r&#257;</span>. The nucleus of the site is partly enclosed by a dark-colored ridge.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMultiple building groups (Residential structures RS2 to RS10) once stood here, many components of which had a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsemi-subterranean aspect. Morphological evidence indicates that most, if not all, the edifices at <span class=\"popular\">Sar&#257;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sa r&#257;</span> had all-stone corbelled roof assemblies. Only one\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tintact roof is still found among them. The <span class=\"popular emph\">do khang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rdo khang</span> in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsuch an extensive settlement are likely to have had both utilitarian and ritual functions. The buildings were\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tprimarily constructed of thin slabs of stone (10 cm to 90 cm long) that were laid in random-work courses. </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>A number of archaic style as well as more conventionally designed <span class=\"popular emph\">Ch&ouml;rten</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mchod rten</span> are also found at <span class=\"popular\">Sar&#257;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sa r&#257;</span>, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmain ceremonial element of the site. The chronological relationship between the ceremonial and residential\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\telements of <span class=\"popular\">Sar&#257;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sa r&#257;</span>is not very clear.
