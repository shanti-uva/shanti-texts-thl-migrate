During the Tibetan imperial period, a man by the name of Amchok S\u00f6nam Norbu (a mchog bsod nams nor bu) took his followers from \u00dctsang (dbus gtsang) to Dom\u00e9 (mdo smad) and settled down in a place, which was later named after him: Amchok. His great-grandfather was a minister under King Tri Songdetsen (khri srong lde btsan) and his family was called Amchok because he received a seal with the Tibetan letter \u201cA\u201d on it from the king. And their family was connected to the Kh\u00f6n (\u2019khon) family of Sakya (sa skya). In Amchok, S\u00f6nam Norbu built a four-story residence for himself and called it the Red Palace.<\/p><p>People in Amchok practiced B\u00f6n until the eighteenth century when a local monk converted them to Geluk (dge lugs). The monk\u2019s name was S\u00f6nam Ch\u00f6mpel (bsod nams chos \u2019phel) and he completed the <em>Lharampa<\/em> (<em>lha rams pa<\/em>) degree at Ganden (dga\u2019 ldan) Monastery. After returning home, he promoted Buddhism and acted as the temporal and religious leader of Amchok. He was considered the first Amchok Rinpoch\u00e9 (a mchog rin po che).\u00a0<\/p><p>Amchok was independent and they had their own ruler. In other words, Amchok was not ruled by the leaders of other communities. Amchok had seven <em>tsowa<\/em> (<em>tsho ba<\/em>) and each had two leaders. Amchok Rinpoch\u00e9 was the general leader (<em>spyi dpon<\/em>). However, the administrative affairs were managed by Amchok P\u00f6npo (a mchog dpon po) along with the fourteen <em>tsop<\/em><em>\u00f6n<\/em> (<em>tsho dpon<\/em>). Amchok had a strong <em>ch<\/em><em>\u00f6y\u00f6n<\/em> (<em>mchod yon<\/em>) relationship with the Three Divisions of Tsawa (tsha ba khag gsum), namely Chokts\u00e9 (cog tse), Somang (so mang), and Trochu (khro chu), all kingdoms in Gyelrong (rgyal rong).<\/p><p><strong>Reference <\/strong><\/p><p>Hor gtsang \u2019jigs med. <em>Mdo smad lo rgyus chen mo las sde tsho\u2019i skor glegs bam dang bo <\/em>[The First Volume of Communities and <em>Tsowa<\/em> (sde tsho) in the Greater History of Amdo].
