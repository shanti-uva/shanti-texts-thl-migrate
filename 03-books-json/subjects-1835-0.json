While <em>bodhicitta</em> may be practiced as a form of meditation, it can also be generated ritualistically in front of a master or a visualized deity. Such a ritual procedure serves to implant the seeds within the disciple for the further cultivation of <em>bodhicitta</em>. The ritualistic generation of <em>bodhicitta </em>is part of many sutra and tantric rituals, like the taking of bodhisattva vows, and tantric initiation. However, <em>bodhicitta</em> generation rituals are sometimes stand-alone rites. The present Dalai Lama often enacts these rituals independent of any others.</p>\n"},{"title":"Example Texts","index":2,"parent_index":0,"body":"\n<ul>\n<li><a class=\"tibtext\" href=\"http://tbrc.org/#!rid=W10483\">byang chub sems bskyed pa'i cho ga shin tu rgyas pa</a></li>\n<li><a class=\"tibtext\" href=\"http://tbrc.org/#!rid=W992\">byang chub kyi sems bskyed pa'i cho ga</a></li>\n<li><a class=\"tibtext\" href=\"http://tbrc.org/#!rid=W13697\">byang chub sems bskyed pa'i 'bogs chog</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"},{"title":"Secondary Sources","index":3,"parent_index":0,"body":"\n<p>Chris: Look at Jeffrey's book on the Kalacakra initiation to see if there is a section on the generation of bodhicitta in a ritualistic fashion.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"}]}
