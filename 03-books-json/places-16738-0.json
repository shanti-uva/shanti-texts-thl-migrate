The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tunbroken specimens are uncut naturally pointed pieces of stones, 20 cm to 40 cm in height. The extant standing\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstones are made of gray and brown quartzitic sandstone (?), and are arrayed in eight different rows. These rows\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tare oriented east-west, as is common in this monument typology. Four upright slabs in two parallel courses,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsituated east of the pillars, may mark the easternmost extent of the array. These parallel slabs (up to 35 cm\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlong) appear to have been part of a double-course wall around 25 cm thick. The distance from this tiny wall\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfragment to the most westerly standing stone (broken at the base) is 13.3 m. The maximum east-west extent of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tarray is 4.9 m. These dimensions and the topographical constraints of the locale indicate that this was a fairly\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsmall example of an array of pillars.
