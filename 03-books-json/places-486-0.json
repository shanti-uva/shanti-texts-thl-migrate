To go up to lHo rong rdzong,<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"> </span>we must drive a\n                        further seven hours via Ri bo che. On our way, at a pass near Chab mdo, we\n                        were all of a sudden struck by a heavy snowfall, which caused us difficulty\n                        and risks. Between Ri bo che and lHo rong rdzong the road is fairly good and\n                        does not, therefore, present that much difficulty.</p>\n\n                  \n\n               "}]}
