The building faces east, the direction of the one exterior entryway. Significant exterior wall and interior partition segments are intact, reaching 1 m to 2 m in elevation. None of the roof appurtenances, however, have survived intact. The overall dimensions of the five-room edifice are 9.3 m (north-south) x 8.6 m (east-west). There is also a very poorly preserved small structural extension on the northeast side of the building. <span class=\"popular\">Taser Gok<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Mtha\u2019 ser gog<\/span> contains three rear\/west rooms and two forward\/east rooms divided from one another by a corridor. <\/p>"},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":"<p>According to local elders, <span class=\"popular\">Taser Gok<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Mtha\u2019 ser gog<\/span> was being used as a retreat house several generations ago. <\/p>"},{"title":"Site elements","index":6,"parent_index":2},{"title":"Residential complex","index":7,"parent_index":6},{"title":"Main edifice","index":8,"parent_index":7,"body":"<p>The 60-cm- to 80-cm-thick walls of the main edifice are robust and somewhat irregular in plan. The mud-mortared, random-work walls are composed of both granite and dark gray metamorphic blocks and slabs. The stones are primarily 10 cm to 60 cm in length, and reach a maximum length of 1.3 m. Most of the exterior faces of the stones were cut flat. The exterior rear or west wall of the main edifice has a height of 1.5 m and an interior height of 2.3 m, illustrating the way in which the rear rooms were built into the slope, according hem a semi-subterranean aspect. The interior corners of the rooms are somewhat rounded, another common design feature of <span class=\"popular emph\">do khang<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rdo khang<\/span> architecture. There are small areas of clay-based plaster remaining on the interior walls of the building, especially in the northwest room. There are also small traces of ochre tinted plaster on the exterior north wall.<\/p><p>The northwest room (2.3 m x 4.4 m) of the rear tier is the largest in the main edifice (it may have been partially divided by a partition wall). The wall dividing the northwest and central west rooms of the rear ier (80 cm thick) still reaches its original height of 1.7 m in some places. This partition wall was massively constructed to support the great weight of a stone roof. There is a central corridor that runs between the rear and forward tier of rooms. This corridor is up to 1.5 m in width and directly connected to he outer entrance vestibule (1.3 m x 2.6 m). An approximately 70-cm wide entrance in the south wall of the corridor leads to the northwest room. The central west room (2.5 m x 3.2 m) of the rear tier appears to have been one undivided space. The southwest room (1.6 m x 4.4 m) of the rear tier may have been broken into east and west parts by a buttress that served as an intermediate load-bearing structure. The northeast room of the forward tier (2.6 m x 2.5 m) is particularly decrepit. The southeast room (2.4 m x 3.7 m) of the forward tier has its entrance in the north wall of the vestibule. The southeast room is bisected north-south by a 1.2-m long buttress, which helped to support the stone roof. <\/p>"},{"title":"Outbound structures","index":9,"parent_index":7,"body":"<p>Adjacent to the south side of the main edifice there is a now disused corral.

Three meters north of the main <span class=\"popular emph\">do khang<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rdo khang<\/span> there is a fragmentary foundation (4.4 m x 4 m). There may also be a small building foundation on the north side of the main edifice. There are the remains of a cubic shrine (1.1 m x 90 cm x 1 m) reposing on a slope, 14 m southwest of the main building This shrine was skillfully constructed of dressed stones and was mud mortared. There is a foundation of what appears to have been a building with two rooms (3 m x 7.5 m) situated 30 m uphill of the main edifice. It was built with a cliff as its backdrop. A forward wall segment in this structure reaches 1.2 m in height. There is some structural evidence to indicate that a wall followed the line of the slope south of the main edifice and this upper level structure. <\/p>"},{"title":"Buddhist shrines","index":10,"parent_index":7,"body":"<p>A wall with inscribed plaques is found immediately west or upslope of the main <span class=\"popular emph\">do khang<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rdo khang<\/span>.
