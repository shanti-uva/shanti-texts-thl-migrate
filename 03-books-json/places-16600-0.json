The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmud-mortared, random-work walls are composed of both granite and dark gray metamorphic blocks and slabs. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstones are primarily 10 cm to 60 cm in length, and reach a maximum length of 1.3 m. Most of the exterior faces\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the stones were cut flat. The exterior rear or west wall of the main edifice has a height of 1.5 m and an\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinterior height of 2.3 m, illustrating the way in which the rear rooms were built into the slope, according\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthem a semi-subterranean aspect. The interior corners of the rooms are somewhat rounded, another common design\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfeature of <span class=\"popular emph\">do khang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rdo khang</span> architecture. There are small\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tareas of clay-based plaster remaining on the interior walls of the building, especially in the northwest room.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThere are also small traces of ochre tinted plaster on the exterior north wall.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The northwest room (2.3 m x 4.4 m) of the rear tier is the largest in the main edifice (it may have been\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpartially divided by a partition wall). The wall dividing the northwest and central west rooms of the rear\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttier (80 cm thick) still reaches its original height of 1.7 m in some places. This partition wall was\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmassively constructed to support the great weight of a stone roof. There is a central corridor that runs\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbetween the rear and forward tier of rooms. This corridor is up to 1.5 m in width and directly connected to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe outer entrance vestibule (1.3 m x 2.6 m). An approximately 70-cm wide entrance in the south wall of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcorridor leads to the northwest room. The central west room (2.5 m x 3.2 m) of the rear tier appears to have\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen one undivided space. The southwest room (1.6 m x 4.4 m) of the rear tier may have been broken into east\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand west parts by a buttress that served as an intermediate load-bearing structure. The northeast room of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tforward tier (2.6 m x 2.5 m) is particularly decrepit. The southeast room (2.4 m x 3.7 m) of the forward tier\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thas its entrance in the north wall of the vestibule. The southeast room is bisected north-south by a 1.2-m\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlong buttress, which helped to support the stone roof. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Outbound structures","index":9,"parent_index":7,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Adjacent to the south side of the main edifice there is a now disused corral.
