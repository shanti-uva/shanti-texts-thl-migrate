The caves face south and east, the two preferred orientations of caves used for occupation in Tibet. The summit of brag mgo bzhag is surmounted by cobble structural remains. The summit complex measures 100 m x 7 m to 15 m. Most of the ruins seem to have long since slipped down the sides of the escarpment.

Just west of the site there is a highly weathered four-sided brown sandstone pillar in the valley bottom. This broken pillar has been reduced to 50 cm in height. The absence of adobe walls, he extreme degradation of the site and lack of evidence for Buddhist occupation seem to indicate an archaic cultural origin.<\/p> "},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":" <p>None was obtained.<\/p> "},{"title":"Site elements","index":6,"parent_index":2,"body":" "},{"title":"Summit complex","index":7,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p>The arc-shaped summit is situated 60 m above the <span class=\"popular\">Sangdar Chu<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Sangs dar chu<\/span>, situated to the east. Access is via a steep ravine that winds around north and east sides of the formation. There also may have once been a route up from the main group of caves but no signs of one remain. The other flanks of the formation are blocked by conglomerate outcrops. The original character and extent of the structures is not clear as very little remains of the site. On the highest part of the summit here are wall segments built against the formation approximately 6 m in length, which attain a height of 1 m to 1.5 m. These mud-mortared walls (up to 80 cm thick) were constructed of cobbles, 20 cm to 50 cm in length. There are several small caves on the summit as well.<\/p> "},{"title":"Affiliated sites","index":8,"parent_index":2,"body":" "},{"title":"Sangs dar jo","index":9,"parent_index":8,"body":null},{"title":"mTho lding castles","index":10,"parent_index":8,"body":" <p>Rising above the plain of <span class=\"popular\">Toding<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Mtho lding<\/span>, on the summits of the mesas bounding the south side of the <span class=\"popular\">Langchen Tsangpo<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Glang chen gtsang po<\/span> valley, are three sites called &lsquo;<span class=\"popular emph\">khar<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mkhar<\/span>&rsquo;.
