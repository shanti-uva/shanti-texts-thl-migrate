The caves face south and east, the two \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpreferred orientations of caves used for occupation in Tibet. The summit of \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbrag mgo bzhag is surmounted by cobble structural remains. The summit complex measures \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t100 m x 7 m to 15 m.

Just west of the site there is a highly weathered four-sided brown sandstone \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpillar in the valley bottom. This broken pillar has been reduced to 50 cm in height.
