It is in close proximity to <span class=\"popular\">Pel Zimpuk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dpal gzims phug</span> monastery. The remnants of a massive revetment wall hem\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin this 75-m long ledge. This wall constitutes the most conspicuous structural feature of the archaic cliff\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdwellings. The original architectural character of these habitations, however, is hardly discernable as the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tledge has undergone significant Buddhist modification. What can be stated is that the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trobustness and size of the revetment is incongruent with the much more modestly-built\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBuddhist monuments sitting on the ledge. The revetment appears to have been designed with\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdefensive purposes in mind and probably for a higher density of habitations. A large gap in the middle of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trevetment demarcates its east and west sectors. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Along its west side, the revetment (up to 1.8 m high) runs along the top of a vertical rock face and loses\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tabout 10 m of elevation. The ledge in this west sector is 4 m to 8.5 m wide. Against the rear of the ledge, a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBuddhist retreat house (8.1 m long, 2.2 m high) with a red and white painted exterior was\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbuilt next to the escarpment. There is an ochre-colored turret (<span class=\"popular emph\">chok</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">lcog</span>) near the west side of the roof. This disused building contains a row of three rooms, each around\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2.5 m in width. In the west wall of the west room there are two niches. The east room was for religious practice\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand probably housed an altar. Just to the east of this retreat house there is a narrow fissure in the escarpment\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcontaining the traces of a stairway, which climbed 2.5 m to the mouth of a cave (4 m deep, 1.6 m wide). The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfa&ccedil;ade around the mouth of this cave (1.8 m long and 2.3 m high) is lightly built and probably of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBuddhist origin. Approximately 4 m above this cave there is another, now inaccessible cave,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twith a masonry fa&ccedil;ade. This cave front appears to belong to the archaic cultural horizon. Corresponding with the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcentral gap in the revetment there is an old masonry <span class=\"popular emph\">Tsatsa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">tshwa\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttshwa</span> receptacle at the base of the escarpment. The ledge of the east sector is 3 m to 9 m in width,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand the revetment bounding it is up to 2.7 m high. On this portion of the ledge there is a small wall with old\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsandstone plaques inscribed with the <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma &#7751;i</span> mantra.
