The site occupies well-drained, moderately sloping sandy and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trocky ground. To the east there is a stream running through the swampy <span class=\"popular\">Pukrong</span><span class=\"scholar\">Phug rong</span> valley bottom, an effluent of the <span class=\"popular\">Nyawa Tsangpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Nya ba gtsang po</span>. The relatively lush pasturage in the <span class=\"popular\">Nyawa Tsangpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Nya ba gtsang po</span> basin must have endowed the region\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twith the economic power to establish <span class=\"popular emph\">Pukchen</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">phug chen</span>, as well as\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tother proximate sites (B-28, B-29, A-74, A-75, A-76). The skillfully built walls of this probable religious center\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tare composed of dry-mortar random-rubble.

It cannot be determined\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif this facility originally belonged to the Bonpo or Buddhists. The strong\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdegree of interactivity between these two religions throughout the early historic period is suggested by the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tjuxtaposition of their motifs in the petroglyphic art of <span class=\"popular\">Shaksang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bshag bsangs</span>, a site located 25 km to the east (I-16). The rivalries and alliances implicit in this\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trock art record may have had a bearing on the cultural legacy of <span class=\"popular\">Pukchen</span><span class=\"scholar\">Phug chen</span>.

The height of the interior rear wall in the north room is 2.2 m, more than half of which is underground.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe structure was built in three tiers, the most forward of which is a courtyard. The middle tier and rear tier\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconsist of two rooms each; these rooms average 3.2 m&sup2; to 4 m&sup2; in size and 1.7 m to 2.2 m in floor-to-ceiling\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\theight. Much of the roof over these four rooms has been preserved. The highest elevation freestanding wall is the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tforward section of the south wall (2.5 m). The independent walls of the courtyard are up to 1.8 m in height. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcourtyard (5 m x 5 m) entrance is in its forward wall. A separate wing of <span class=\"popular\">Pukchen</span><span class=\"scholar\">Phug chen</span> is located on the north side of the standing structures, and has\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen reduced to its foundations.

In the west wall of the middle tier north room there is the entranceway to the rear\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttier north room. This 80-cm wide entranceway is obstructed by rubble but appears to be less that 1 m in height.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThere is also a window (40 cm x 45 cm) in the wall dividing the middle tier north room and rear tier rooms. South\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the middle tier north room there is an interclose (60 cm to 1.5 m in long, 90 cm wide) leading to the middle\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttier south room. A typically constructed portal in the west wall of the middle tier south room accesses the rear\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttier south room. There is a small window opening (12 cm x 25 cm) in the south wall of the middle tier south room. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Shrines","index":7,"parent_index":6,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Near the edifice there is an all-stone cubic shrine (1.6 m x 1.6 m x 1 m).
