The Tent Temple has no fixed location. It is moved from one place to\n                     another just as the nomadic tents. Every year a new location for the tent is\n                     chosen to perform the annual rituals. These rituals are usually performed only\n                     in autumn on pasture so that the weather is still warm and convenient for the\n                     people to attend the ceremony. </p>\n\n               "}]}
