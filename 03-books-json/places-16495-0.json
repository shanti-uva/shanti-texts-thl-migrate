Ruined Buddhist temples\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand cave complexes are found in these long-abandoned villages. No monumental traces of the archaic cultural\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thorizon were found at these sites. It is thought by some elders of the region that these settlements collapsed\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\talong with the <span class=\"popular\">Gug&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ge</span> kingdom in the 16th century\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCE. After crossing the bridge upstream of <span class=\"popular\">Tsarang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rtsa rang</span> to the north bank of the Sutlej, one enters a thorn forest. Heading downstream, the first abandoned village reached is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"popular\">Karru</span><span class=\"scholar\">Kar ru</span> (31&deg; 29.0&#900; N. lat. / 79&deg; 41.2&#900; E. long. /\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3670 m). Extensive farm fields once existed here but now there are just barren flats. There are a few caves in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tescarpment bounding the former agricultural lands. These caves contain arched niches and other signs of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thabitation. It is reported that in the Chinese Cultural Revolution some farming took place in <span class=\"popular\">Karru</span><span class=\"scholar\">Kar ru</span> for a short while, but this activity was abandoned\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause of water problems. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>A thorn forest and an intervening valley called rtsa chu (sp.?) demarcate the border\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbetween ka ru and the next abandoned agricultural village of gi ri.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThere are several dozen caves in the escarpment at gi ri, at least one of which has\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBuddhist murals. On top of the escarpment are the ruins of <span class=\"popular\">Giri Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gi ri mkhar</span> with its tall adobe walls. In the valley bottom are the ruins\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof a significant Buddhist monastery (31&deg; 29.4&#900; N. lat. / 79&deg; 39.3&#900; E. long. / 3640 m). The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvalley the next community down valley, separated by a narrow constriction, was called <span class=\"popular\">Gogyam</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sgo gyam</span>. Intensive agriculture was once practiced here\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbut there are few caves and no monumental remains. Continuing down valley, the next derelict village is Golden Chest. Golden\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChest had its own monastery in the valley bottom (31&deg; 30.0&#900; N. lat. / 79&deg; 37.5&#900; E. long. / 3620 m),\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand nearby there is a small group of adobe buildings referred to as <span class=\"popular\">Sergam Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gser sgam mkhar</span>. There are many defunct agricultural lands in Golden Chest. As of 2001, Chinese farmers had been brought in to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tresuscitate some of these fields. Continuing downstream, the last village before the Sutlej\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t enters an impassable gorge is <span class=\"popular\">Mangdrak</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mang brag</span> (31&deg; 30.4 N. lat. / 79&deg; 35.3 E. long / 3610 m). There is a cave complex in the multicolored\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tescarpment and the remains of old arable lands at <span class=\"popular\">Mangdrak</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mang brag</span>. One of the caves contains a chapel with circa 13th century CE murals. Among them is a panel\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twith portraits of ten of <span class=\"popular\">Gug&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ge</span>&rsquo;s territorial deity with mostly intact inscriptions naming them, an extremely important\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcultural resource. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>On the south side of the Sutlej,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tseveral kilometers east of <span class=\"popular\">Tsarang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rtsa rang</span>, there is a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcave complex in the escarpment at <span class=\"popular\">Tang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Thang</span>. In\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\taddition to around 30 caves that were once inhabited, there is a large area of disused fields at <span class=\"popular\">Tang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Thang</span>. Several ruined a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttype of shrine are found in the vicinity.
