   "body": "<p class=\"Paragraph\">In the case of interrogative sentences that directly concern the person being addressed (that is, sentences containing second-person pronouns), the questioner must anticipate an answer containing an “I” or a “we” by making advance use of an egophoric auxiliary in the question itself.</p><ul> <li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ཁྱེད་རང་བདེ་པོ་ཡིན་པས།</span> “Are you well?”</li> <li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ང་རང་བདེ་པོ་ཡིན་ / མིན།</span> “I’m well/not well.”</li> </ul><p class=\"Paragraph\">This exchange might be rendered literally in English as “Am you well?” since the anticipated reply, whether positive or negative, is “I am well/ not well.”</p><p class=\"Paragraph\">The rule of anticipation operates in a similar way, but with a reverse result, when the speaker is asking a question about him– or herself. In this case, since the reply will of course contain a “you,” the rule requires that the first person be represented by a neutral, not egophoric, auxiliary.</p><ul> <li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ང་སྨྱོན་པ་རེད་པས།</span> “Am I mad?”</li> <li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ཁྱེད་རང་སྨྱོན་པ་(མ་)རེད།</span> “You are (not) mad!”</li> </ul><p class=\"Paragraph\">A more literal English rendering of this exchange would be:</p><ul> <li>“Are I mad?”</li> <li>“You are(n’t) mad.”</li> </ul><p>This “anticipatory mood” is a distinctive feature of Tibetan. It appears not only in Standard Tibetan but in all other Tibetan dialects too, though not in the classical literary language.</p>",
