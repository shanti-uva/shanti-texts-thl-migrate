In this case, since the reply will of course contain a &ldquo;you,&rdquo; the rule requires that the first person be represented by a neutral, not egophoric, auxiliary.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ང་སྨྱོན་པ་རེད་པས།</span> &ldquo;Am I mad?&rdquo;</li>\n<li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ཁྱེད་རང་སྨྱོན་པ་(མ་)རེད།</span> &ldquo;You are (not) mad!&rdquo;</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"Paragraph\">A more literal English rendering of this exchange would be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&ldquo;Are I mad?&rdquo;</li>\n<li>&ldquo;You are(n&rsquo;t) mad.&rdquo;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This &ldquo;anticipatory mood&rdquo; is a distinctive feature of Tibetan. It appears not only in Standard Tibetan but in all other Tibetan dialects too, though not in the classical literary language.</p>","title":""}]}
