The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcommanding position of the site lends it the aura of both a stronghold and palace. The main edifice (23 m x 17 m)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcontained around 20 rooms. The random-rubble walls of this structure are topped by rammed-earth walls of varying\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\theights.

These walls have short spans and are aligned in various directions, creating a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmultifaceted ground plan. Walls are as much as 3 m in height on the south side of the structure and as little as\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t50 cm high on the north side. Above the stone walls there are bits of highly degraded rammed-earth walls. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttallest extant rammed-earth wall sections are 2.5 m in height. The orifices (used to accommodate the pins that\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\theld the wooden molding in place during the construction of the earthen walls) are lined with thin pieces of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstone. The exterior south wall is the highest elevation feature (up to 4 m) to have persisted at the site. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tentrance to the castle was in the southeast and was built upon a high elevation revetment, which contains cruder\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstonework than that of the freestanding walls. The deeply recessed entrance creates an inlet, 4.5 m in length\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand 2.8 m in width on its exterior side. This sheltered space progressively narrows towards the core of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbuilding. It appears that a stone buttressed trail led up to the entrance but very little of it has survived. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>In the east exterior wall of the building, near the south corner, there is the only extant window opening (35\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcm x 25 cm) at the site. In the north of the structure there are the remains of an interior mud-block wall, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tonly one of this type at ha la mkhar  (West). The room partitions are now highly dissolute\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand reach a maximum height of 1.5 m to 2 m. These dividing walls were primarily built of stone, at least along\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir lower courses. The constructional features for the support of a stone roof are not present at\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tha la mkhar West, thus we can infer that its roof was supported by timbers. Local\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trounds of tamarisk, which reach 2 m to 2.5 m in length, may have been used for this purpose. Below the entrance\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto the main building there was a small dependency, which has been leveled to its footings. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n"}]}
