The enclosure is highly fragmentary and its lower part has been heavily impacted by geomorphologic changes. Its configuration and mode of construction are not clear. There is a little structural evidence to suggest that the perimeter walls were of the double-course variety. The enclosure was not aligned in the cardinal directions. Uncut pieces of white granite, up to 1.2 m in length, went into its construction. Some of these stones protrude prominently from the ground surface. This enclosure appears o represent a transitional monumental form between the isolated pillars of the far eastern <span class=\"popular\">Jangtang<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Byang thang<\/span> (see C-7 and C-36) and those enclosed inside well-delineated walls common farther west.
