George Roerich reports that three\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmenhirs were found with stone slabs arranged around them in a square (George N.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRoerich, <em>Trails to Inmost Asia: Five Years of Exploration with the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRoerich Central Asian Expedition</em>. reprint edition, (Delhi: Book Faith India, 1996), 416, 417). He notes that no traces of libations were found at the site, and he concludes\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat this &lsquo;sanctuary&rsquo; was probably abandoned a long time ago. Roerich characterized the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmenhirs discovered on the RCAE as pre-Buddhistic sites, belonging to a phase in Tibetan history dominated by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t&ldquo;primitive B&ouml;n&rdquo; (Roerich. <em>Trails to Inmost\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAsia</em>. 355). After discovering the menhirs, Roerich\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttells us that the RCAE camped at a location called Ratri, 22 miles southwest of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDo-ring (see C-162), and from there around the north side of <span class=\"popular\">Gomang Tso</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sgo mang mtsho</span>the next day.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRatri is described by Roerich as a locale with granite slopes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRatri can be no other than <span class=\"popular\">ratra</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ra gra</span> (sp.?)
