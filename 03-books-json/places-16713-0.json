There is a little structural evidence to suggest that the perimeter walls were of the double-course variety. The enclosure was not aligned in the cardinal directions. Uncut pieces of white granite, up to 1.2 m in length, went into its construction. Some of these stones protrude prominently from the ground surface.

George Roerich reports that three menhirs were found with stone slabs arranged around them in a square (George N. Roerich, <em>Trails to Inmost Asia: Five Years of Exploration with the Roerich Central Asian Expedition</em>. reprint edition, (Delhi: Book Faith India, 1996), 416, 417). He notes that no traces of libations were found at the site, and he concludes that this ‘sanctuary’ was probably abandoned a long time ago. Roerich characterized the menhirs discovered on the RCAE as pre-Buddhistic sites, belonging to a phase in Tibetan history dominated by “primitive Bön” (Roerich. <em>Trails to Inmost Asia</em>. 355). After discovering the menhirs, Roerich tells us that the RCAE camped at a location called Ratri, 22 miles southwest of Do-ring (see C-162), and from there around the north side of <span class=\"popular\">Gomang Tso</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sgo mang mtsho</span>the next day. Ratri is described by Roerich as a locale with granite slopes. Ratri can be no other than <span class=\"popular\">ratra</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ra gra</span> (sp.?) (31° 19.1΄ N. long / 89° 15.1΄ E. long. / 4680 m), a location a little downstream of <span class=\"popular\">Ngoring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sngo ring</span> (this general area is dominated by granite formations). Inquiries with local <span class=\"popular emph\">drok pa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">’brog pa</span> revealed that there is no other place in the <span class=\"popular\">Gomang Tso</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sgo mang mtsho</span> basin with a name that, in the <span class=\"popular\">Hor</span><span class=\"scholar\">Hor</span> dialect, is phonetically similar to ‘Ratri’. Furthermore, in his account, Roerich notes that Ratri is located 22 miles south of the megalithic site of Do-ring. Roerich’s Do-ring has been identified as <span class=\"popular\">Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo ring</span> (South) (31° 22.7 N. lat. / 89° 26.0 E. long.), situated 22 km (as the crow flies) northeast of <span class=\"popular\">Ngoring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sngo ring</span> (see C-162) and 25 km northeast of <span class=\"popular\">ratra</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ra gra</span>.
