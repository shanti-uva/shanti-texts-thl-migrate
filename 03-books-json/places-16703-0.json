The site sits at the northeast foot of <span class=\"popular\">Cheri Teldzong</span><span class=\"scholar\">Phye ri thal rdzong</span>, a prominent hill of the locale (see E-22). The terrain is level, sandy and overgrown with <span class=\"popular emph\">drama</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">gra ma</span> brush. The ground must have presented quite a different and less degraded appearance at the time the monuments were created. In addition to a row of pillars and associated walls, here are four funerary enclosures at the site. All these structures are built of a dark, grained rock. The very sandy ground upon which <span class=\"popular\">Zhingsa Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Zhing sa rdo ring</span>was built has taken a large toll on the integrity of the monuments. </p>
<p>According to <span class=\"popular\">Runtor</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ru ’thor</span> elders, <span class=\"popular\">Zhingsa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Zhing sa</span> was farmed in ancient times. Two small perennial streams originating from the flanks of the meridian range flow through this sandy basin. No terracing, retaining walls or other signs of old agriculture were detected at <span class=\"popular\">Zhingsa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Zhing sa</span>. Such structures, however, could have been easily engulfed by the unstable sandy terrain. </p>
