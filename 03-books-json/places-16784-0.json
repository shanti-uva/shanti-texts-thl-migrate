The site is situated on he east margin of the <span class=\"popular\">Dawa Tso</span><span class=\"scholar\">Zla ba mtsho</span> basin. Views o the south and east are open, less so in other directions. The terrain is level, well drained, sandy, and studded with many boulders and rocks. There is a <span class=\"popular emph\">drok pa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">’brog pa</span> permanent settlement (<span class=\"popular emph\">zhima</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">gzhi ma</span>) in the proximity. There are more than 20 widely distributed funerary structures at <span class=\"popular\">Nara Möndur</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sna ra mon dur</span>. They are well camouflaged among naturally occurring rocks and boulders, which has probably contributed to the site being untouched in recent years. The structures are made of uncut pieces of white granite and a dark gray metamorphic rock. They represent a rich variety of designs and methods of construction. Among the most unusual funerary structures at <span class=\"popular\">Nara Möndur</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sna ra mon dur</span> are those with a pillar erected inside the perimeter walls (Funerary structures FS3 and FS4). The sandy substrate of the site has significantly contributed to the deterioration of the funerary structures. Given the nature of the terrain, some funerary structures may have been overlooked during the survey.</p>",
