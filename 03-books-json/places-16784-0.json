The perimeter walls (50 cm to 70 cm thick) are composed of stones up to 50 cm in length. Many of these upright stones project as much as 25 cm above ground level. The enclosure is divided into two parts: a smaller east cell and the larger west cell. Inside the west cell, near its west end, there is a single-course inner enclosure or cist marker (60 cm x 1.1 m). The upright stones of this structure prominently protrude from the ground. The largest stone in the inner enclosure is located in the east wall; 50 cm long and rising 30 cm above the ground surface.<\/p> "},{"title":"Funerary Structure FS3","index":9,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p>Funerary structure FS3 (3.5 m x 5 m) appears to be an ovoid enclosure but there are no coherent in situ wall fragments remaining (16.548&#900; \/ 07.107&#900;). The entire structure is somewhat elevated above the surrounding errain. The stones along the perimeter reach 50 cm in length. Near the west side of FS3 there is a four-sided gray pillar (45 cm [height] x 70 cm [basal girth]). The relative placement of the pillar mimics those belonging o the enclosed pillar typology (II.2b). The erection of a pillar on such a structure is extremely notable and highly unusual. The functional and temporal features of this design trait have yet to be determined. <\/p> "},{"title":"Funerary Structure FS4","index":10,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p>Funerary structure FS4 (6.4 m x 4.4 m) is of the same design and construction as FS3 (16.740&#900; \/ 07.283&#900;).

In the east wall there are two stones (40 cm and 50 cm long) that are set perpendicular to the wall course, creating a kind of portal (as is found in certain enclosures of the II.1b ypology). In the vicinity there are other analogous structures that were not individually surveyed.
