In English, the factitive is often expressed by the auxiliary “to have” or “to make” (someone do something). The Tibetan factitive construction may also be translated by “to let” (someone do something).</p> <p class=\"Paragraph\">The usual factitive construction is: Verb + <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">རུ་</span> + <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">འཇུག་</span>.</p> <p class=\"Paragraph\">A factitive transformation is made by placing after the verb the suffix <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">རུ་</span>, which corresponds to one of the (literary) forms of the oblique, followed by the verb <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">འཇུག་</span>, the past tense of which is <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">བཅུག་</span>. In Literary Tibetan, the form of the oblique is modified according to the last letter of the preceding verb. In the spoken language, however, the particle may often be omitted altogether in the construction.</p> <ul> <li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">སྐད་བརྒྱབ་(རུ་)འཇུག་</span> “To make somebody shout” </li> <li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">སྐད་བརྒྱག་ཏུ་འཇུག་</span> “To make somebody shout” (L)</li> <li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">མོ་རང་གིས་ལས་ཀ་བྱེད་(རུ་)འཇུག་གི་མི་འདུག</span> “She doesn’t let me work.”</li> <li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ངས་ཁོང་ཡི་གེ་འབྲི་(རུ་)བཅུག་པ་ཡིན།</span> “I made him write a letter.”</li> </ul>","title":""}]}
