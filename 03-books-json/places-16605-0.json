The fragmentary foundations of the single structure are aligned in the cardinal directions, and are elevated about 1.5 m above the surrounding plain.

The <span class=\"popular\">Sogpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sog po</span> are thought to have colonized the locale in the distant past. It is said that the ruins resembled those at <span class=\"popular\">Beltsa Gyangtrok</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bal tshwa gyang khrog</span> near <span class=\"popular\">Dargyé Ling</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dar rgyas gling</span>, <span class=\"popular\">Saga</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sa dga’</span> county. Local elders report that this windowless edifice had an east-facing entrance around 1 m in height. The structure stood in a fairly good state of preservation until it was gradually demolished beginning in the Chinese Cultural Revolution. Elders report, however, that the edifice did not have a roof during their lifetimes. In the pre-modern period the walls of the so-called fortress were taller than the present day <span class=\"popular emph\">Chörten</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mchod rten </span> (they were probably around 4 m in height). The stones removed from the monument were used to build corrals around <span class=\"popular\">Sok</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sog</span>village. Some <span class=\"popular emph\">drok pa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">’brog pa</span> claim that a stone with an inscription somewhat resembling Chinese was found in the foundation of the structure.
