The pillar is slightly inclined to the south. In close proximity there are three pieces of gray granite (35 cm, 50 cm and 70 cm long), which may have been part of other pillars at one time. Between 50 cm and 1.4 m from the pillar, four granite slabs (around 15 cm long) are embedded edgewise into the ground. These stones must be the remains of a slab-wall structure. <\/p>  "}]}
