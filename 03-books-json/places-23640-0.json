The story goes that the Tibetan settlers chose this lonely place for its good pastureland. Matri stones in the area are pointed out as evidence of the antiquity of Bon practice in the area. As contact between the Tibetans and the southern population grew closer, the practice of Bon fell into abeyance. Rituals were customarily performed by Bonpo priests from sPung mo, mTsho or Hurikot, but for some years there has been a general wish to have a resident bla ma. In 2001 work began on the construction of a monastery. </p> <p>The name of the site, Mon ri zur gsum, is derived from that of a nearby mountain, a pilgrimage place that is said to have been opened by Ha ra ci par. A stupa standing amind some ruins near Khaliban is said to mark the site of the original temple founded by Ha ra ci par. Other sacred relics include a footprint in stone said to have been left by Ka ru Grub dbang bsTan ’dzin rin chen (nineteenth century) while he was performing prostrations in front of the holy mountain. </p> "},{"title":"4-7.
