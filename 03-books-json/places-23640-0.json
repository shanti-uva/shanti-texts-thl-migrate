Matri stones in the area are pointed out as evidence of\n                        the antiquity of Bon practice in the area. As contact between the Tibetans\n                        and the southern population grew closer, the practice of Bon fell into\n                        abeyance. Rituals were customarily performed by Bonpo priests from sPung mo,\n                        mTsho or Hurikot, but for some years there has been a general wish to have a\n                        resident bla ma. In 2001 work began on the construction of a monastery. </p>\n\n                     <p>The name of the site, Mon ri zur gsum, is derived from that of a nearby\n                        mountain, a pilgrimage place that is said to have been opened by Ha ra ci\n                        par.
