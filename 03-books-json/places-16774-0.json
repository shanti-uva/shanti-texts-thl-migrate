Some of the enclosures appear almost oval in form, but this is most\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlikely due to the deterioration of the perimeter walls and the migration of the constituent stones. A number of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tenclosures are elevated as much as 50 cm to 60 cm above the surrounding terrain. Aligning walls to the cardinal\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdirections is not a dominant feature of the site. A few enclosures still have coherent wall fragments (60 cm to 85\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcm thick). These double-course or multiple-course walls are composed of smaller beige, tan and grayish stones (10\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcm to 40 cm long), which are even with the ground level or slightly elevated above it. Due to the disintegration\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the superstructures, it could not be determined if other wall types are also represented at <span class=\"popular\">Dripra M&ouml;ndur</span><span class=\"scholar\">Grib ra mon dur</span>. While most enclosures are free of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinternal structures, certain specimens are completely covered in stones, which may possibly signal another form of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdesign.
