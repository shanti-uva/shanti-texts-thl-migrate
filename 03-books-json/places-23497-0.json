The three masters played a key role in the first spread of Bon in\n                        Amdo. There are descendents of gTso still living in The bo, Khri ka, Shar\n                        khog (=Zung chu) and rGan rgya in Amdo. Kyang za Yig rtsis ma, the mother of\n                        the three masters, also a fervent Bonpo, established her main residence at a\n                        site known as dGu skyang. gTso &rsquo;phags Zla ba rgyal mtshan is believed to\n                        have travelled extensively throughout the area, actively spreading the Bon\n                        religion. Although he founded only a number of sacred sites (and no\n                        monastery), he made a profound impression on the local culture and\n                        traditions. One of his mother&rsquo;s sacred sites and his main ritual and\n                        cremation sites are located at Chu gter rdzong, on Brag dkar bya rgod, a\n                        sacred mountain (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">gnas ri</span>) in Amdo. The first Bonpo\n                        monasteries were founded much later (only four to five generations ago) by\n                        gTso &rsquo;phags&rsquo;s descendents.
