This structure is 103 m in length (east-west), making it the largest funerary enclosure\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsurveyed to date. The east wall is 37 m long and the west wall is 28 m long. There are right angle bends\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(approximately 3.5 m long) in both the north and south walls, 23 m east of the west wall, which account for\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe difference in the width of the east and west sides of the structure. The double-course and multiple-course\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tperimeter walls (around 70 cm thick) are composed of uncut, variable-length (up to 70 cm long) pieces of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlight-colored limestone. Some sections of the perimeter walls are of superficial construction, consisting of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tblocky stones embedded in the ground. Many of these stones project up to 35 cm above the ground surface. Other\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsections (particularly on the east and north sides of the enclosure) consist of up to five vertical courses of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstones, producing walls up to 30 cm in height. The east wall of the enclosure is elevated about 50 cm above\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe adjoining slope. There is an opening in the east wall, 1.7 m in width. This opening begins 14 m from the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsouth corner of the enclosure, and is therefore not very well centered. Most of the interior of the enclosure\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tis devoid of structural elements.
