This structure is 103 m in length (east-west), making it the largest funerary enclosure surveyed to date. The east wall is 37 m long and the west wall is 28 m long. There are right angle bends (approximately 3.5 m long) in both the north and south walls, 23 m east of the west wall, which account for he difference in the width of the east and west sides of the structure. The double-course and multiple-course perimeter walls (around 70 cm thick) are composed of uncut, variable-length (up to 70 cm long) pieces of light-colored limestone. Some sections of the perimeter walls are of superficial construction, consisting of blocky stones embedded in the ground. Many of these stones project up to 35 cm above the ground surface. Other sections (particularly on the east and north sides of the enclosure) consist of up to five vertical courses of stones, producing walls up to 30 cm in height. The east wall of the enclosure is elevated about 50 cm above he adjoining slope. There is an opening in the east wall, 1.7 m in width. This opening begins 14 m from the south corner of the enclosure, and is therefore not very well centered. Most of the interior of the enclosure is devoid of structural elements. However, near the west end of the interior, there are faint rocky dispersions of unknown function. Orange climax lichen grows on the walls of the giant enclosure.<\/p> "},{"title":"Group of three enclosures","index":9,"parent_index":7,"body":" <p>Approximately 50 m south of the giant enclosure there are three well-defined squarish funerary enclosures. These enclosures are generally aligned in the cardinal directions and form an east-west row. Their not very coherent, double-course perimeter walls (around 40 cm thick) are composed of stones (10 cm to 50 cm long) embedded in the ground surface. There are also wall sections comprised of stones that probably formed two or hree vertical courses (50 cm maximum height). These three enclosures have open interiors.

These two rows are oriented north-south, but they are not very straight. Each structure in a row is spaced 7.5 m to 9 m apart. The east row (18 m long) contains 7 structures and the shorter west row has four structures. These enclosures (80 cm to 1 m across) are sub-rectangular in form and have single-course perimeter walls. The stones in the perimeter walls are flush with the ground surface or slightly protrude above it. The interiors are variously open or covered in stones. Between the east row and FS3 there is an isolated specimen of the same construction.

This uniquely designed enclosure is generally aligned in the cardinal directions, and measures 28.5 m (north-south) x 25 m (east-west). The design of the perimeter walls is no longer very clear but they do not appear to have been very substantially built. There appear to have been parallel outer and inner walls on the north and south sides of the enclosure. The inner walls have been nearly effaced. Inside the outer enclosure there are three subsidiary enclosures that are symmetrically arrayed. These long and narrow rectangular structures are also aligned in the cardinal directions. They possess single-course perimeter walls composed of stones up to 45 cm in length, which are embedded in the substrate. These stones are flush with the ground surface or rise above it to a maximum height of 15 cm. The largest of the three subsidiary enclosures is set in the very middle of he outer enclosure. It measures 12 m (east-west) x 1.8 m (north-south). On the east end of the largest subsidiary enclosure there is a band (about 2 m long) of tightly knit stones embedded in the ground. The other wo subsidiary enclosures measure approximately 8 m (north-south) x 1.8 m (east-west). They are situated 2 m east of the larger subsidiary enclosure and are aligned at right angles to it. There is a gap of 2.6 m between he two smaller specimens. The two smaller enclosures also have bands of stones covering the ground surface on heir facing ends. In the east wall of the outer enclosure there seems to be an opening, which is aligned with he gap between the two smaller subsidiary enclosures. The two smaller subsidiary enclosures appear to merge with inner north and south walls of the outer enclosure. <\/p> <p>Funerary structure FS8 (3.5 m across) is situated 18 m north of the tripartite enclosure.

This site is called khra phug. Reportedly, in the Chinese Cultural Revolution, a couple of large, predominantly white limestone enclosures at khra phug were used to grow grass or grain shoots. Between these two enclosures there are the remains of a possible funerary enclosure (3.5 m x 3.5 m). The perimeter walls of this highly deteriorated structure are composed of both flat and upright stones. On one corner of the enclosure there is a thin upright slab, which projects 50 cm above ground level. <\/p>  "}]}
