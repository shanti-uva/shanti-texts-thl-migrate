The poorly preserved structure was built in a sheltered location and has an eastern aspect. The widest view from the site is to the north. It is one of the only archaic residential sites discovered in <span class=\"popular\">Zhungpa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gzhung pa</span>, a region plentiful in ceremonial pillar sites. Variable-sized stones (up to 60 cm) went into the construction of the random-rubble walls of<span class=\"popular\">Zicha Mönkhang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Zi cha mon khang</span>. The remains of a cubic shrine (1.2 m x 1.2 m) aligned in the cardinal directions is located 11.5 m north of the <span class=\"popular emph\">do khang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rdo khang</span>. It appears to be an integral part of the residential site.</p>",

The longer east wall is caused by a small extension in this direction. The east-west dimension of <span class=\"popular\">Zicha Mönkhang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Zi cha mon khang</span> is as much as 8.5 m if he most outlying footings are taken into account. These forward footings, however, are so fragmentary that their identity is ambiguous (they could have variously supported a forward tier of rooms, a courtyard wall or a landing). The highest elevation wall (1.6 m) is along the middle of the west/upper side of the edifice. On the interior side of this wall segment there are two niches with their lintels intact (60 cm x 50 cm x 40 cm, 30 cm x 30 cm x 50 cm). Other walls of the <span class=\"popular emph\">do khang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rdo khang</span> are only 50 cm to 1 m in height. There were four west or rear rooms; small remnants of their partition walls are in situ. The layout of what was either the middle or forward tier of rooms in no longer discernable. In the center part of this ier there is an entranceway (70 cm x 50 cm). Although the heavy 1-m long lintel is in place, much deformation of he opening has occurred. </p>",
