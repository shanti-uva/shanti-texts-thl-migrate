The longer east wall is caused by a small extension in this direction. The east-west dimension of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"popular\">Zicha M&ouml;nkhang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Zi cha mon khang</span> is as much as 8.5 m if\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe most outlying footings are taken into account. These forward footings, however, are so fragmentary that their\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tidentity is ambiguous (they could have variously supported a forward tier of rooms, a courtyard wall or a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlanding). The highest elevation wall (1.6 m) is along the middle of the west/upper side of the edifice. On the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinterior side of this wall segment there are two niches with their lintels intact (60 cm x 50 cm x 40 cm, 30 cm x\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t30 cm x 50 cm).

In the center part of this\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttier there is an entranceway (70 cm x 50 cm). Although the heavy 1-m long lintel is in place, much deformation of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe opening has occurred. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n"}]}
