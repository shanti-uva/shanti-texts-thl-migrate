In the \"Historical buildings in Lhasa\" table at the back of the book (pp. 165-172), buildings of the \"Townhouse\" type are designated with the letter \"G\" in the building type column. In the THL Place Dictionary, when a building has this feature type and the <em>Lhasa Atlas</em> is given as the source, it means that the building was designated with a \"G\" in the <em>Lhasa Atlas</em> table.<br /><br />This building type is described as follows:<br /><br />\"<em>G. Townhouse</em>. Example: Trapchishar (1).<br /><br />\"The townhouse is a further example of the most common traditional residential building type, adapted to suit often quite confined urban sites. Each townhouse has a courtyard, often small but essential for light and ventilation, which acts as an arena for outddor domestic activities. On the Barkor and many other market lanes, the ground floor shops connect to dwelling areas above by means of steep ladders and trap doors\" (p. 61).<br /><br />Source:<br /><br />Larsen, Knud and Amund Sinding-Larsen. <em>The Lhasa Atlas: Traditional Tibetan Architecture and Townscape</em>.
