The central chamber contains a room (5.7 m x 3.8 m x 2 m) with well-built freestanding masonry walls that sequester it from the rest of the cave. There is a niche in the north wall of this room. A passageway connects the central and west chambers. The entrance to the west chamber descends around 3 m to the outer ledge below. Where this entrance joins the west chamber, there is a 2.5-m long wall that forms a landing. In the rear of this 3-m high cave there is a naturally elevated area. In front of this uplifted space there is an adobe platform (1.6 m x 1 m x 20 cm). The east chamber appears to have remained in a raw state. <\/p> <hr class=\"footnote-divider\" \/> "},{"title":"Notes","index":9,"parent_index":0,"body":null}]}
