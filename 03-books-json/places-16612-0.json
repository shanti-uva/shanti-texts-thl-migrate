In the valley there are various springs, thus this\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsite, with its adequate shelter, is ideal for human settlement. skid sgrom dgon pa consists\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof three interconnected caves found behind a big ledge that forms in the formation. This 35-m long, 3-m- to 4-m\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twide ledge appears to have been fully enclosed by a masonry fa&ccedil;ade, tiny portions of which have survived along the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\teastern and western extremities. The three caves of the site have heavily fire-blackened ceilings and are now used\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto corral sheep and goats. The caves have the following dimensions: east chamber (around 7.3 m x 7.5 m), central\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tchamber (10 m x 11 m) and west chamber (approximately 9.5 m across). </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>On the west wall of the west chamber the Buddhist\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"popular\">Riksum G&ouml;npo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rigs gsum mgon po</span> mantras\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twere painted long ago in red ochre on a white background. The painting of these mantras seems to have been carried\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tout in order to bring the site within the auspices of Buddhism. The lack of other\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBuddhist monuments at the site, its subterranean aspect, and the existence of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBon pictographs in other caves in the area (J-15, J-16), allude to a Bon\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tidentity for the cave sanctuary.
