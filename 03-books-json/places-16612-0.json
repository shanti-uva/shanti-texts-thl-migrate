In the valley there are various springs, thus this site, with its adequate shelter, is ideal for human settlement. skid sgrom dgon pa consists of three interconnected caves found behind a big ledge that forms in the formation. This 35-m long, 3-m- to 4-m wide ledge appears to have been fully enclosed by a masonry fa\u00e7ade, tiny portions of which have survived along the eastern and western extremities. The three caves of the site have heavily fire-blackened ceilings and are now used o corral sheep and goats. The caves have the following dimensions: east chamber (around 7.3 m x 7.5 m), central chamber (10 m x 11 m) and west chamber (approximately 9.5 m across). <\/p><p>On the west wall of the west chamber the Buddhist <span class=\"popular\">Riksum G\u00f6npo<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Rigs gsum mgon po<\/span> mantras were painted long ago in red ochre on a white background. The painting of these mantras seems to have been carried out in order to bring the site within the auspices of Buddhism. The lack of other Buddhist monuments at the site, its subterranean aspect, and the existence of Bon pictographs in other caves in the area (J-15, J-16), allude to a Bon identity for the cave sanctuary. The residential center of <span class=\"popular\">Kyidrom G\u00f6npa<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Skyid sgrom dgon pa<\/span> was probably a religious center of the prehistoric and\/or early historic (archaic cultural horizon) inhabitants of the region.

This ledge is suspended approximately 20 m above the valley floor. The masonry wall lining the outer rim of this natural structure is highly eroded and fragmentary. The random-work fa\u00e7ade of the central chamber was constructed of variable-sized pieces of limestone (15 cm to 70 cm long) that were profusely mud mortared. The east portion of the fa\u00e7ade has a maximum height of 3.5 m and is 1 m thick at the base. Near the top section of this stonework front there is a small window. Minute traces of red ochre coloring are still distinguishable on the fa\u00e7ade. <\/p>"},{"title":"Cave complex","index":8,"parent_index":6,"body":"<p>From the ledge there are south-facing entrances to both the west and central chambers. The central chamber contains a room (5.7 m x 3.8 m x 2 m) with well-built freestanding masonry walls that sequester it from the rest of the cave. There is a niche in the north wall of this room. A passageway connects the central and west chambers. The entrance to the west chamber descends around 3 m to the outer ledge below. Where this entrance joins the west chamber, there is a 2.5-m long wall that forms a landing. In the rear of this 3-m high cave there is a naturally elevated area. In front of this uplifted space there is an adobe platform (1.6 m x 1 m x 20 cm). The east chamber appears to have remained in a raw state. <\/p><hr class=\"footnote-divider\" \/>"},{"title":"Notes","index":9,"parent_index":0,"body":"<div class=\"footnote\"> <a name=\"n89\" \/> <a href=\"#nb89\" class=\"note\"> [89] <\/a> This site was documented by <span class=\"popular\">Pel Riwa Lozang Tashi<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Dpal ri ba blo bzang bkra shis<\/span> (Lecturer, Arts Department, Tibet University) and two of his Chinese colleagues, in July 2001.
