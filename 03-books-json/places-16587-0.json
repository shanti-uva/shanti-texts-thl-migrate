While there is a string of archaic temples and citadels in lower elevation western <span class=\"popular\">Rutok</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ru thog</span>, this is the only all-stone corbelled complex to be\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfound on the lofty plains of northeastern <span class=\"popular\">Rutok</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ru thog</span>.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAt one time, <span class=\"popular\">Riu G&ouml;npa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ri&rsquo;u dgon pa</span>was clearly the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpremier religious facility in the region, illustrating that sedentary habitation extended into this marginal\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tphysical environment (very high, cold and dry). This unique all-stone temple complex has architectural features of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tboth the Bon\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"popular emph\">sekhang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">gsas khang</span> and Buddhist\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"popular emph\">g&ouml;npa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">dgon pa</span>. The site is located at the base of a black ridge that\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tis said by local people to have the shape of a <span class=\"popular emph\">Khyung</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">khyung</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(horned eagle). The monument consists of a large main temple (18 m x 13.5 m) and several dependencies and <span class=\"popular emph\">Ch&ouml;rten</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mchod rten</span>-like shrines, which overlook the confluence of three\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trivers (a rare geographic occurrence this far north on the Plateau). </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>All structures are built in a uniform fashion, indicating that <span class=\"popular emph\">Riu G&ouml;npa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ri&rsquo;u dgon pa</span> was founded as an integrated facility. As such, the various structures were probably\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconstructed in the same general time period. There appears to be no structural evidence to show that <span class=\"popular\">Riu G&ouml;npa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ri&rsquo;u dgon pa</span> was ever modified or underwent major\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trefurbishment. The implication of this may be that it had a relatively short lifespan as a major religious center\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbefore devolving to individual meditators. The most notable constructional feature of the facility is that it was\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbuilt entirely of stone. Moreover, the quality of the stonework is exceptional. <span class=\"popular\">Riu G&ouml;npa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ri&rsquo;u dgon pa</span> exhibits Buddhist monastic design traits\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsuch as relatively large entrances, inner courtyards, shrine rooms in the west, and the use of embellished\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdoorjambs (<span class=\"popular emph\">ruzhi</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ru bzhi</span>), lintels and cornices (lithic equivalents\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof Tibetan architectural elements known as <span class=\"popular emph\">bap</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">bab</span> and <span class=\"popular emph\">trashing</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">kha shing</span>). On the other hand, the warren of small, irregularly shaped\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twindowless rooms, semi-subterranean aspect and corbelled roofs are design characteristics derived from the <span class=\"popular emph\">sekhang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">gsas khang</span> religious architecture native to Upper Tibet. This juxtaposition of the two major forms of Upper Tibetan temple\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconstruction may indicate that <span class=\"popular\">Riu G&ouml;npa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ri&rsquo;u dgon pa</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trepresents a transitional architectural form. If this is indeed the case, a periodization to the early historic\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tperiod is best indicated. This is the time period in which native and Buddhist forms of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\treligion and culture first encountered each other in far-reaching ways.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>In recent years, the long stone members of <span class=\"popular\">Riu G&ouml;npa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ri&rsquo;u dgon pa</span> have been hauled away wholesale in trucks for use at area <span class=\"popular emph\">drok pa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">&rsquo;brog\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpa</span> camps.

It is said that <span class=\"popular\">Tsampa K&uuml;nga Dorj&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mtshams pa kun dga&rsquo; rdo rje</span>, a disciple of the 15th <span class=\"popular\">Karmapa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Karma pa</span>,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmeditated here. <span class=\"popular\">Riu G&ouml;npa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ri&rsquo;u dgon pa</span> was heavily\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvandalized during the Chinese Cultural Revolution. According to two regional elders (including one whose relative\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tis enshrined in the <span class=\"popular\">Riu G&ouml;npa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ri&rsquo;u dgon pa</span> reliquary\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"popular emph\">Ch&ouml;rten</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mchod rten</span>), sometime after its founding, <span class=\"popular\">Riu G&ouml;npa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ri&rsquo;u dgon pa</span> came under an inauspicious spell. One\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnight this caused the death of a monk who became a reanimated corpse (<span class=\"popular emph\">rolang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ro lang</span>). This reanimated corpse began touching the sleeping monks around him causing them to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\talso die and become reanimated corpses. One monk, however, managed to wake up before being murdered and bolted\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom <span class=\"popular\">Riu G&ouml;npa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ri&rsquo;u dgon pa</span>.

The outer walls have numerous angles, creating a series of nooks inside the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbuilding and shortened spans for the heavy stone elements of the roof. The south or downhill wall is the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thighest structure at the site; it is uniformly 3.5 m to 4 m in height. The north or upslope wall is deeply set\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinto the ground. The west half of the north wall has a maximum height of only 1.3 m, while the east half of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe north wall is flush with the slope. These elevations include a parapet wall that extends 50 cm above the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\troofline. Except for the main entrance in the east, the alignment of the main building in the cardinal\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdirections was not a significant consideration. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>In the south wall there are two stone gutters that convey runoff from the roof to the ground below, thus\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tprotecting the masonry from waterborne damage. Also in the middle of the exterior south wall, at ground level,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthere is a 1-m high privy pit. Near the west corner of the south wall there is the temple&rsquo;s only exterior\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twindow (25 cm x 30 cm). It is set in an indentation that measures 35 cm x 50 cm. East of the main building\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthere are remnants of walls with small alcoves overlaid with stone beams. These walls appear to have been part\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof a gallery that enclosed an outer courtyard, 17 m in length. This enclosure is now used as a winter\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlivestock pen.

The random-rubble walls are of the dry-mortar variety or\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twith seams that were minimally mud mortared. Sandstone slabs of variable size (15 cm to 90 cm in length) were\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tused in wall construction. Walls were heavily plastered on both their interior and exterior faces.
