It consists of a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsingle structure, the remains of a castle or palace (10.5 m x 13 m). Built of both stone and mud bricks, the age\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof this type of architectonic composition is unclear. The lack of Buddhist constructions and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe oral tradition suggest a relatively early foundation date. In any case, the refined design of Black Acme Castle suggests that this was once an important cultural\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcenter.

Only two other examples of this\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tarchitectural form have come to light in Upper Tibet: ha la mkhar\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t (East) (A-58) and <span class=\"popular\">K&ouml;l Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Kol mkhar</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(A-122), which are also located in <span class=\"popular\">Gug&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ge</span>.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBlack Acme Castle consisted of at least five\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconterminous rooms set at two or three different levels. Remaining wall partitions are highly deteriorated,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tprecluding a detailed assessment of its ground plan. The long spans between the walls and the fact that they are\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnot buttressed, indicates that the structure was built with a wooden roof. Moreover, appropriate building\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmaterials for the construction of corbelled stone roofs are lacking in this locale, as they are in much of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"popular\">Gug&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ge</span>. The dark-colored stone-walls were finely\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbuilt of hewn blocks 35 cm to 75 cm in length. These random-rubble walls appear to have been heavily cemented\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twith a mud-based mortar. The stones are highly weathered and cracked, attesting to significant age. This seems\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto justify the local belief that this was an ancient &lsquo;<span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span>&rsquo; or archaic cultural horizon site. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The deeply recessed entrance is on the south side of the building. Massive stone-walls on the south face of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstronghold reach 3.5 m in height and are still topped by adobe-block (mud-brick) courses, adding as much as\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tanother 70 cm to the elevation. On the north side of the edifice adobe-block walls up to 1.5 m in height\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsurmount a stone revetment. These adobe walls have lost more than 50% of their mass (much more loss than is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttypically found in Lamaist era buildings of <span class=\"popular\">Gug&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ge</span>). It is only in a sheltered niche that the techniques of construction and the seams between\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tindividual blocks are discernable. The top of this interior wall niche (35 cm x 50 cm x 1 m) is supported by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsmall rounds of brushwood. An integral part of this north wall structure, this wood might hold important clues\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tas to the age of the castle.
