The old castle occupies he entire length of the outcrop (41 m). The outer side of this knob of rock (35 m in height) provided a fairly defensible position, as well as high social visibility in this stretch of the <span class=\"popular\">Senge Tsangpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sengge gtsang po</span> valley. A single line of structures, arrayed east-west, once stood on the outcrop. Although significant wall elevations are found, no remains of the roofs are extant. The regular ground plan of the rooms indicates that the roofs were made of wood. Poplar and willow trees hrive further down the <span class=\"popular\">Senge Tsangpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sengge gtsang po</span> valley in <span class=\"popular\">Ladak</span><span class=\"scholar\">La dwags</span>, but perhaps they once grew in his region as well. The east end of the summit is 4.7 m wide but most of it is around 6 m in width. The revetments supporting the buildings along the edges of the formation are minimal – 1 m or less in height. Below he west side of the summit there are the remains of a single wall (6 m long, up to 3.2 m in height) clinging to a rock face, which was probably constructed for defensive purposes. This wall creates a staging platform 1.9 m in width. <span class=\"popular\">Serzhung Khargok</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gser gzhung mkhar gog</span> was built from the same light-colored uncut granite blocks (generally 15 cm to 40 cm in length) as the neighboring strongholds of <span class=\"popular\">Khargok Dorjé Yudrönma</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mkhar gog rdo rje g.yu sgron ma</span> (A-124) and <span class=\"popular\">Kolok Khargok</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ko logs mkhar gog</span> (A-125). The random-rubble walls (45 cm to 60 cm in thick) were heavily cemented with mud. </p><p>Defunct arable lands in the vicinity of <span class=\"popular\">Serzhung Khargok</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gser gzhung mkhar gog</span> appear to have been significantly smaller in extent than those at <span class=\"popular\">Kolok Khargok</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ko logs mkhar gog</span> (A-125). This more limited land-base is reflected in the size of the facility, which is smaller than <span class=\"popular\">Kolok Khargok</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ko logs mkhar gog</span>. </p>",

The west structure (6.5 m x 4.5 m), despite having wall fragments up to 1.6 m in height, has been mostly obliterated. This destruction can be partially attributed to he failure of the slope upon which it was built. The east structure (7 m x 4 m?) is even more fragmentary. Its forward wall reaches 1.4 m in height. The main access route to the summit probably passed by these two outlying buildings. </p>",
