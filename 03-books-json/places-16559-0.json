The old castle occupies\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe entire length of the outcrop (41 m). The outer side of this knob of rock (35 m in height) provided a fairly\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdefensible position, as well as high social visibility in this stretch of the <span class=\"popular\">Senge Tsangpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sengge gtsang po</span> valley. A single line of structures, arrayed\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\teast-west, once stood on the outcrop. Although significant wall elevations are found, no remains of the roofs are\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\textant. The regular ground plan of the rooms indicates that the roofs were made of wood. Poplar and willow trees\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthrive further down the <span class=\"popular\">Senge Tsangpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sengge gtsang po</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvalley in <span class=\"popular\">Ladak</span><span class=\"scholar\">La dwags</span>, but perhaps they once grew in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthis region as well. The east end of the summit is 4.7 m wide but most of it is around 6 m in width. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trevetments supporting the buildings along the edges of the formation are minimal &ndash; 1 m or less in height. Below\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe west side of the summit there are the remains of a single wall (6 m long, up to 3.2 m in height) clinging to a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trock face, which was probably constructed for defensive purposes. This wall creates a staging platform 1.9 m in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twidth. <span class=\"popular\">Serzhung Khargok</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gser gzhung mkhar gog</span> was built\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom the same light-colored uncut granite blocks (generally 15 cm to 40 cm in length) as the neighboring\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstrongholds of <span class=\"popular\">Khargok Dorj&eacute; Yudr&ouml;nma</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mkhar gog rdo rje g.yu sgron ma</span> (A-124) and <span class=\"popular\">Kolok Khargok</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ko logs mkhar gog</span> (A-125).
