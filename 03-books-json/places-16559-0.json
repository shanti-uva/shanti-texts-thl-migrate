The west structure (6.5 m x 4.5 m), despite having wall fragments up to 1.6 m in height, has been mostly obliterated. This destruction can be partially attributed to he failure of the slope upon which it was built. The east structure (7 m x 4 m?) is even more fragmentary. Its forward wall reaches 1.4 m in height. The main access route to the summit probably passed by these two outlying buildings. <\/p>  "}]}
