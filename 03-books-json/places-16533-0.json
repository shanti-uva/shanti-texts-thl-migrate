To the east of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthese modern retrenchments a level pad was constructed on the ridge-top, probably for military exercises. This\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChinese military facility has been abandoned for many years now. Despite the radical alteration of the site, some\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the original walls (revetments) have survived and are platform-like in appearance. They have a random-rubble\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttexture and were built from limestone and sandstone blocks (10 cm to 70 cm long). Many of the stones used in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tolder constructions were carefully hewn into shape. The remains of a stone-buttressed trail lead over a knob on\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe ridgeline to the main cluster of ruins (32 m x 7.5 m to 14 m). </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>A largely ruined stronghold called <span class=\"popular emph\">podrang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">pho brang</span> (palace)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\texisted here until the Chinese Communist period.
