Many parts of its four walls are intact. These superficial (consisting of a single layer of stones) walls are flush with the surrounding ground level, 60 cm in thickness and made up of smaller stones (up to 40 cm long). In order to maintain a level space, the enclosure is elevated 50 cm above the adjacent terrain on its eastern flank. <\/p> "},{"title":"Pillars","index":8,"parent_index":7,"body":" <p>While most pillars parallel the full extent of the west wall, some of them extend a short distance along the inner edges of the north and south walls of the enclosure, creating a U-shaped array. All but three of the stelae are 60 cm or less in height. Most of the shorter specimens have sustained some damage and are missing heir top sections. The stelae are unhewn and made from various types of rock. These stones are tabular, hree-sided and irregularly shaped.
