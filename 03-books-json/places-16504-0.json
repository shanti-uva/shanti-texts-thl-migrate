The use of stone appurtenances in the construction of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthis facility, the predominance of tiny rooms, the meandering wall plans, and the prominent revetments all point\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto an archaic cultural horizon origin. The largest and best preserved ruins are those of the upper complex (160\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tm&sup2;). They repose on the highest outcrop of the site, poised 80 m above the valley floor.

These same walls on their interior side are 2.2 m high,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe difference being accounted for by the revetment underpinning the building.

The interior north wall has been cut down to an elevation of 1.5 m. The upper\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tedifice contained a number of small rooms in the archaic design plan.
