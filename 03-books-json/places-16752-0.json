The slope upon which they were erected is quite steep and very sandy. It appears to have undergone significant geomorphologic changes over time. The uneven row of mostly smaller pillars is aligned perpendicular to the angle of the slope. Many of the bluish pillars are broken, and gaps in the row suggest that some of them are missing altogether. The north end of the row may have had upwards of 10 diminutive pillars. The 1.7-m long south end of the row contains five larger standing stones. From south to north, they have the following dimensions: 40 cm (height) x 95 cm (basal girth), 50 cm x 75 cm, 70 cm x 85 cm, 1.3 m x 1.2 m, and 80 cm x 95 cm. The tallest specimen is quite tabular in form and its two broad sides are oriented north and south. There appears to have been walls around this line of pillars, which were aligned in the cardinal directions. This prospective enclosure approximately measures 5 m (east-west) x 7.2 m (north-south). Virtually nothing but a faint outline remains of the possible enclosure. Its highly nebulous form and the sharply sloping terrain make positive identification of this structure difficult. </p> "},{"title":"Other pillars","index":8,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p>A non-uniform tabular pillar (1.1 m x 1.9 m) is situated 16.5 m uphill/west of pillar group 1.

The vestiges of other small pillars and walls seem to be distributed over nearby sandy slopes.

This enclosure appears to primarily have single-course perimeter walls, but there are also a couple sections along the perimeter that may be of double-course construction.
