The slope upon which they were erected is quite steep and very sandy. It appears to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thave undergone significant geomorphologic changes over time. The uneven row of mostly smaller pillars is aligned\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tperpendicular to the angle of the slope. Many of the bluish pillars are broken, and gaps in the row suggest that\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsome of them are missing altogether. The north end of the row may have had upwards of 10 diminutive pillars. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1.7-m long south end of the row contains five larger standing stones. From south to north, they have the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfollowing dimensions: 40 cm (height) x 95 cm (basal girth), 50 cm x 75 cm, 70 cm x 85 cm, 1.3 m x 1.2 m, and 80\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcm x 95 cm.
