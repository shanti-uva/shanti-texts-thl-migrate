FS1 occupies an isolated position on the edge of the plain. This enclosure appears to primarily have single-course perimeter walls, but there are also a couple sections along the perimeter that may be of double-course construction. The upright variable-length unshaped stones (20 cm to 70 cm long) of the walls project 10 cm to 40 cm above the ground surface.

This structure has single-course perimeter walls, which contain upright stones up to 70 cm in length, which project as much as 35 cm from the ground surface. The 12 cells (2 m x 2 m) form a single line of structures, and are separated from one another by a distance of 40 cm to 90 cm.
