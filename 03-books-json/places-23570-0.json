History","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n\n                     <p>There are two legends about the origin of the monastery and its name.\n                        According to one legend recorded by &rsquo;Phrin dga&rsquo;<a href=\"#n39\" name=\"nb39\" class=\"note\">39</a> which I also heard when I visited the monastery in 1997, Dam pa rang\n                        grol, a Bonpo master from dGe bshes tsa in Rong brag (rGyal rong), came to\n                        Ba smad and established a hermitage there in the 3rd Rab byung (1147-1206).\n                        The hermitage gradually expanded into a monastery which was named after its\n                        founder. </p>\n\n                     <p>According to the other legend, a Bonpo master called Rig &rsquo;dzin Shar ba rnal\n                        &rsquo;byor attempted to make a statue of gShen rab Mi bo, but despite his efforts\n                        he did not succeed, so in the end he threw out the unfinished statue into\n                        the monastery&rsquo;s courtyard and returned to his room. The next morning, the\n                        statue had become a perfect representation of gShen rab Mi bo. It was named\n                        sTon pa Rang grub, the &ldquo;self-manifesting master&rdquo; and the monastery was named\n                        after it. The statue is believed to have survived until the mid-20th\n                        century.</p>\n\n                     <p>Although there is a list of masters which &rsquo;Phrin dga&rsquo; claims represents the\n                        lineage of the monastery&rsquo;s masters, it is obvious that there are several\n                        names in the list that have nothing to do with the monastery&rsquo;s history so I\n                        did not find it necessary to include it here. The monastery was rebuilt and\n                        resumed its religious activities in the 1980s. The last three descendants of\n                        Khod po Blo gros thogs med who looked after the monastery are Blo gros, his\n                        nephew (khu dbon gdung brgyud), rDo rje, and the latter&rsquo;s nephew, Nor bu\n                        dbang chen (b.1967), who is the present khri pa of the monastery.</p>\n\n                  \n\n                  \n\n                     "},{"title":"4.
