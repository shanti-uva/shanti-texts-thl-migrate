Four generations later, bDud &rsquo;dul\n                        grags pa, the valley&rsquo;s chief, forced the monastery to move to sPang dmar.\n                        The new monastery was considerably enlarged to include a twenty-room\n                        assembly hall (&rsquo;du khang) and fifty monks&rsquo; cells housing more than a hundred\n                        monks. Then lHa lug tshul khrims moved the monastery to a site called Lug ge\n                        where it remained active for seven generations. The monastery was later\n                        moved again by Byang chub to gNas khog where it remained for only fifty\n                        years, then dBra sras Zla ba grags pa, a son of dBra sprul bsTan &rsquo;dzin dbang\n                        rgyal of rDza sTeng chen Monastery (No. 139) and a master of Shar rdza bKra\n                        shis rgyal mtshan (who wrote his biography) rebuilt it at bDe cha and named\n                        it bDe chen bsam gtan gling. At that time, it had an eighteen-room assembly\n                        hall and fifteen monks&rsquo; cells. He spent thirteen years at the monastery\n                        before &ldquo;passing away into his rainbow body&rdquo; (&rsquo;ja&rsquo; lus pa), at the beginning\n                        of the 20th century.
