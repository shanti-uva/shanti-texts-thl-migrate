I found only a brief history<a href=\"#n26\" name=\"nb26\" class=\"note\">26<\/a> containing legendary accounts according to which a Bonpo master called rGya mda\u2019 ri nang came to the sNyi khog valley and built the monastery in the middle of the 6th Rab byung (1327-1386), after having built Chu ring Monastery in Chu ring valley. Four generations later, bDud \u2019dul grags pa, the valley\u2019s chief, forced the monastery to move to sPang dmar. The new monastery was considerably enlarged to include a twenty-room assembly hall (\u2019du khang) and fifty monks\u2019 cells housing more than a hundred monks. Then lHa lug tshul khrims moved the monastery to a site called Lug ge where it remained active for seven generations. The monastery was later moved again by Byang chub to gNas khog where it remained for only fifty years, then dBra sras Zla ba grags pa, a son of dBra sprul bsTan \u2019dzin dbang rgyal of rDza sTeng chen Monastery (No. 139) and a master of Shar rdza bKra shis rgyal mtshan (who wrote his biography) rebuilt it at bDe cha and named it bDe chen bsam gtan gling. At that time, it had an eighteen-room assembly hall and fifteen monks\u2019 cells. He spent thirteen years at the monastery before \u201cpassing away into his rainbow body\u201d (\u2019ja\u2019 lus pa), at the beginning of the 20th century. Then Tshul khrims \u2019od zer (1910-1971) and rDo rje tshe dbang (1890-1962) who were disciples of dBra sras Zla ba grags pa were in charge of the monastery for more than forty years. Both were monks and had received teachings from Phun tshogs blo gros, the abbot of sMan ri Monastery (No.1) at the time. <\/p><p>During the Cultural Revolution the monastery was knocked down and in the 1980s it was rebuilt with its twenty-five-room assembly hall and twenty-two monks\u2019 cells by sPul sku Nam mkha\u2019 \u2019od zer gzhan phan mtha\u2019 yas (b.1937) and \u2019Jam dbyangs. <\/p><p>sPul sku Nam mkha\u2019 is the rebirth of Zla ba grags pa and at present in charge of the monastery.
