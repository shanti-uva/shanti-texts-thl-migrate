It\n                        regrouped the five former main monasteries: dGa&rsquo; mal, sNa steng (No.199),\n                        Rin sprungs (No.200), sNang zhig dngul sku (No.201), and sKyang tshang\n                        (No.202).</p>\n\n                     <p>When the assembly hall of the new dGa&rsquo; mal was completed, Shes rab mthar\n                        phyin (b.1933) was chosen to be the abbot and sKal bzang dar rgyas the chief\n                        teacher (bon slob) of the new monastery. The monks of the old dGal&rsquo; mal were\n                        content to cooperate in establishing the new dGa&rsquo; mal. Later, however, the\n                        monks of sKyang tshang, sNang zhig, Rin sprungs, sNa steng and other\n                        monasteries in the area began to rebuild their own monasteries at their\n                        original sites and resumed independent religious activities. This event led\n                        the monks of the old dGa&rsquo; mal to rebuild their own monastery too, although\n                        the two are now located within the same compound. The new dGa&rsquo; mal\n                        nevertheless continues to function as a representative body of the five\n                        monasteries.</p>\n\n                  \n\n                  \n\n                     "},{"title":"4.
