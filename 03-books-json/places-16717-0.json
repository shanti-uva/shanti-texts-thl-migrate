Closed off to the west, the site has profound views to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\teast and is open to the north and south as well. <span class=\"popular\">Kyiser</span><span class=\"scholar\">Skyid gser</span> is a diverse funerary complex of considerable importance. As the array of pillars appended to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tan edifice (II.1c) is the largest and most prominent element of the location, it appears to have constituted the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcentral feature of the <span class=\"popular\">Kyiser</span><span class=\"scholar\">Skyid gser</span>necropolis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis prominence is reinforced by the conspicuous location of the array and edifice on the margins of the large\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tplain. The smaller monumental elements of the location were established in more secluded and harder to find sites.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe <span class=\"popular\">Kyiser</span><span class=\"scholar\">Skyid gser</span> necropolis also includes an\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tisolated pillar (II.1a), pillars erected inside an enclosure (II.1b), funerary enclosures (II.2b), unusually\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdesigned slab walls, and other types of funerary structures. The existence of the three common Upper Tibetan\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpillar typologies at one site, underscores the integral nature of these monuments in an architectural, cognitive\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand ritual sense. By virtue of these monuments being found together, it can be surmised that they had\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcomplimentary functions. The integrated nature of the various monumental components of the site may also indicate\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat they were built and used within the same timeframe. The various funerary monuments of <span class=\"popular\">Kyiser</span><span class=\"scholar\">Skyid gser</span> are all constructed of uncut pieces of brown\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsandstone. This sandstone is found in abundance on the abutting ridge. <span class=\"popular\">Kyiser</span><span class=\"scholar\">Skyid gser</span> is sited in a locale with a scarcity of potable water, as are many other\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfunerary sites in Upper Tibet. Given the size and complexity of <span class=\"popular\">Kyiser</span><span class=\"scholar\">Skyid gser</span>, it is certainly possible that certain outlying\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfunerary structures were overlooked during the survey.<a href=\"#n45\" name=\"nb45\" class=\"note\">45</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>According to <span class=\"popular emph\">drok pa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">&rsquo;brog pa</span> of <span class=\"popular\">Drabuk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gra sbug</span> township, the array of pillars at <span class=\"popular\">Kyiser</span><span class=\"scholar\">Skyid gser</span> have ancient <span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand <span class=\"popular\">Ling Gesar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gling ge sar</span> associations.

The east-west dimensions provided are between the most outlying row of pillars and the east wall\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the appended edifice. Originally, there were roughly 20 east-west oriented rows of pillars in the array.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThere are still around 130 standing stones, less than 15 percent of the original number. As intact lines of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpillars are spaced 30 cm to 50 cm apart (with wider spacings more common), it can be extrapolated that there\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twere no less than 1000 standing stones in the array. All of the brown sandstone pillars are highly eroded and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\textremely weathered. Most of the in situ pillars are tabular but there are also four-sided and irregularly\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tshaped specimens, especially among the smaller ones. The broad sides of the tabular pillars are oriented north\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand south. There are 26 larger pillars (40 cm and 60 cm high), which are mostly concentrated on the east side\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the array. Some uprooted specimens up to 70 cm in length lie about the concourse. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The east side of the array of pillars is bordered by a single-course slab wall. A northern fragment of this\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twall is 8.4 m long. This wall is composed of slabs 15 cm to 60 cm in length, which are only around 1 cm in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthickness. These slabs are flush with the ground surface or slightly project above it. There are also three\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\teast-west running double-course slab-wall fragments bordering and inside the pillar concourse. The parallel\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcourses of slabs are spaced 20 cm to 30 apart. These three double-course walls are highly fragmentary and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir original configuration and lengths could not be determined. The most intact of these wall fragments (3.3\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tm long) is found on the north side of the pillar array. The double-course wall fragment bordering the south\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tside of the pillar array is 2.9 m in length. On its west end there is a connecting double-course wall 90 cm in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlength that runs perpendicular. Little pieces of milky quartz in small amounts are scattered around the array\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof pillars.
