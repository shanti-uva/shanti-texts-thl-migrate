The ruined\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbuildings begin a little above the valley floor and continue upward to a small summit, situated approximately 30 m\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tabove the valley bottom. Its position, directly above the valley, indicates that it played a prominent role in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdefense of this locale. The buildings spill down the steep hillside for about 30 m in a swathe around 15 m in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twidth. Examination of the extant remains suggests that there were six tiers of buildings. Only some external walls\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpersist, as all interior partitions have been recently destroyed. The mainly coursed-rubble mud-mortared walls\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twere constructed from pinkish brown sandstone blocks, 30 cm to 60 cm in length. Walls are 60 cm to 70 cm in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthickness.

This distinctive design feature is fairly unusual in residential buildings, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tseems to indicate that the two fortresses are chronologically and culturally linked. The geographic aspect of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe two sites is also similar in that the installations are closely flanked by higher ground, hence they were\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpotentially vulnerable to attack from above. From the structural evidence remaining it appears that the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbuildings of Purplish Brown Cliff Shelter Castle had\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twooden roofs.
