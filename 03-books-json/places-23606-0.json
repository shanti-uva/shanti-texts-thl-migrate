History","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":" <p>sKyang btsun gYung drung bstan rgyal (b.1768), a descendant of sKyang ’phags in mDzo dge, went to sMan ri Monastery (No.1) in gTsang and received teachings from a great master called gYung drung dbang rgyal. After thirteen years of study, the latter sent him back to Amdo. When he arrived in Shar khog, gTso tshang dbon po and his fifteen disciples came to meet him and became his disciples. Later he was offered land by the local people and founded a hermitage at the site called Rin spungs. Later he extended it into monastery. Towards the end of his life, a thirteen-year old boy called dGe ’dun shes rab (b.1811) from dMu dge came to Rin spungs following a vision he had received in dream. gYung drung bstan rgyal was very enthusiastic about the new visitor and exhorted his disciples to accept dGe ’dun shes rab as his reincarnation after his death. He asked dGe ’dun shes rab to return to the monastery in seven years. He is said to have even made an inventory of all his personal belongings in the presence of dGe ’dun shes rab, and ordered the monks to give them to dGe ’dun shes rab upon his return. However, dGe ’dun shes rab did not return seven years later as agreed so gYung drung bstan rgyas, before his death, left a testament for him in a small wooden box which he hid in the wall of his meditation cell. Finally, the monastery sent some monks to dMu dge to talk with dGe ’dun shes rab’s family who warmly welcomed them and accepted the recognition of their son as the reincarnation of gYung drung bstan rgyal, but the boy was not at home. </p> <p>In the mean time, dGe ’dun shes rab had travelled to rGyal rong, Khyung po, Kong po, lHa sa, rMe’u tshang, Dar ldings, Zhu tshang; he studied at rMan ri for seven years, practiced meditation at Byang gNam mtsho for one year and Khyung po’i sgom grwa for another six years, and had visited many sacred places and monasteries of different traditions (including Buddhism) where he studied and practiced meditation with various great masters and acquired the new name of Shes rab ye shes. Shortly after his return to dMu dge, remembering his promise to gYung drung bstan rgyal, he returned to the monastery. Although the master had died a few years before he was given all gYung drung bstan rgyal’s personal belongings and valuables including the box with the testament. </p> <p>gYung drung bstan rgyal introduced the monastic tradition of sMan ri Monastery and named the monastery Rin spungs bKra shis smin grol gling. He became the second master of sKyang tshang lineage and abbot of Rin spungs Monastery. The third master was bsTan ’dzin phun tshogs dbang rgyal. The fourth was Shes rab rnam rgyal. </p> <p>The reincarnation of Shes rab ye shes was born soon after his death in Chu mdo village near the monastery, but he died very young. The following reincarnation, Shes rab rnam rgyal, was born in Shel bod village of dMu dge in 1895.</p> <p>The fifth was gYung drung bstan ’dzin, born in 1955.</p> <p>The monastery was destroyed during the Cultual Revolution and was rebuilt in the 1980s.</p> "},{"title":"4.
