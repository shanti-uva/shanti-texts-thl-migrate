This <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">xiang</span> lies\n                        on the northern side of the lake Dwang ra g-yu mtsho.</p>\n\n                     <p>The monastery was established by bSod nams g-yung drung around 1890. He is\n                        regarded as one of the Thirteen Spiritual Leaders of Lake Dwang ra (Dwang ra\n                        g-yu mtsho&rsquo;i &rsquo;gro &rsquo;dren bcu gsum) and belonged to the lineage of Guru. This\n                        lineage is traced back to Guru gYung drung phun tshogs, from which it\n                        descends to bZod pa and down to the Guru &rsquo;Od zer, who is the fourth in the\n                        line.</p>\n\n                     <p>The main religious objects are the sacred statues of Bla chen Dran pa nam\n                        mkha&rsquo; with his twin sons. It is said that there used to be an important old\n                        manuscript called Bya rgod mchu bris (&ldquo;written with the beak of\n                        vulture&rdquo;).</p>\n\n                     <p>Every year in the first Tibetan month, a large-scale, prescribed service of\n                        the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">bum sgrub</span> ritual is held, during which the monks\n                        meditate mainly on the deity Khro bo. Otherwise, services on a smaller scale\n                        are performed frequently.</p>\n\n                     <p>In the old days there used to be more than twenty monks, but now there are\n                        no more than ten monks and one lama; the present condition of the monastery\n                        is not as good as it was previously.</p>\n\n                     <p>Some degree of restoration was carried Guru &rsquo;Od zer. The main source of\n                        income, to maintain the monks and the lama, is donations from each household\n                        and the performance of religious services in the village.</p>\n\n                     <p>rGya rgod <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">xiang</span> lies thirteen kilometres away.

We met more than one hundred pilgrims who were on their way\n                        to Ser zhig Monastery (No.19) or Mount rTa sgo, and we took many pictures of\n                        each other.</p>\n\n                  "}]}
