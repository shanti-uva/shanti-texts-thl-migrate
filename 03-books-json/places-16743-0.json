It is in very poor\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcondition: only about 130 specimens are still left standing. There are also a few uprooted pillars strewn around\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe concourse. These standing and dislodged pillars are but a small fraction of the perhaps 1000 menhirs that\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\toriginally stood at the site. The individual pillars range between 10 cm to 60 cm in height, with an average\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\theight of approximately 20 cm. Most of these unhewn standing stones are irregularly shaped, and some of them\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsupport orange climax lichen growth. The majority of the in situ pillars are in the southwest portion of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tarray. Only the tallest pillar at the site and one other specimen still stand in the northern half of the array\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(nothing else has survived in this obliterated part of the array). A maximum of three pillars adjacent to one\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tanother stand in any one row, providing some idea of how fragmentary the array has become. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Four meters east of the most easterly in situ pillar there is a double-course north-south running slab-wall\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfragment (approximately 6.5 m long). This wall is composed of parallel courses of upright slabs, (7 cm to 40 cm\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlong) set about 25 cm apart from one another. These slabs are level with the ground surface. The south end of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthis slab wall seems to coincide with the southeast corner of the pillar array. A single line of upright slabs\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tforms a squarish enclosure (70 cm x 70 cm), which lies adjacent to the east side of the double-course slab wall,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t4.5 m north of its southern end. A zone of tiny slab fragments oriented both east-west and north-south is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsituated 3.5 m east of the south end of the double-course slab wall. The precise configuration of these wall\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfragments is no longer discernable. The north-south running, double-course slab wall bounding the east side of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe pillar array is connected to an east-west aligned slab wall of the same type (6.3 m long). This east-west\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twall bounds the south side of the pillar array. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<hr class=\"footnote-divider\" />\n"},{"title":"Notes","index":9,"parent_index":0,"body":"\n<div class=\"footnote\">\n<a name=\"n54\" />\n<a href=\"#nb54\" class=\"note\">\n\t     \t\t\t\t[54] </a> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe border of Tibet (<span class=\"popular\">B&ouml;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bod</span>) and <span class=\"popular\">Zhang Zhung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Zhang zhung</span> is discussed using textual and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tarchaeological data in Bellezza, &ldquo;Territorial\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCharacteristics of the Archaic Zhang-zhung Paleocultural Entity.&rdquo;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n"}]}
