Many of the tombs were either destroyed\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tor structurally modified, obliterating most original design features of these monuments. None of them have fully\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tintact central depositories (reliquaries). These structures are of typical size, measuring 1.8 m to 2.5 m on each\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof their four sides. Primarily blocks 30 cm to 80 cm in length and 10 cm to 20 cm in thickness were used to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconstruct the tombs.

The relatively\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\theavy traffic through the region and the zeal of Buddhist pilgrims and clerics over the centuries may well have\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tplayed a role in the degradation of the tombs of <span class=\"popular\">Dzari Rakpa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdza ri rag pa</span>. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>According to some local sources, the mountain of <span class=\"popular\">Dzari Rakpa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdza ri rag pa</span> was once a <span class=\"popular\">Singpa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sing pa</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(invaders from the northwest) stronghold.
