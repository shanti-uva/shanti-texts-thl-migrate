At this location there is a single gutted cubic tomb. Its east wall still attains 1.5 m in height but very little else remains intact. Below the knob of rock there are the remains of a quadrate slab-wall enclosure (3.7 m x 3.7 m). This structure was built of slabs up to 80 cm in length that protrude as much as 30 cm above ground level. Another fragmentary enclosure (5 m across) is situated on a rocky slope 28 m to the south. <\/p> "},{"title":"North central sector","index":9,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p>Located higher up the ridgeline, the north central sector contains the highest elevation tombs at <span class=\"popular\">Dzari Rakpa<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdza ri rag pa<\/span> (43.522&#900; \/ 09.719&#900; 5080 m). The central sector hosts at least one dozen highly deteriorated tombs that were built on a rocky outcrop. On the east side of the north central sector there are three somewhat better-preserved specimens that form a row along he ridgeline. These three larger specimens measure about 2.5 m on each side. Traces of what appears to have been the central depository (1.8 m x 40 cm x 50 cm [depth]) have survived in the highest tomb among them. The stone blocks along the edge of this central chamber form less than perfectly straight walls. In the lowest specimen of the three tombs, there are three in situ blocks forming one corner of the central depository. From he stones of other north central sector tombs, a cairn, a shepherd&rsquo;s shelter and the base of a prayer flag mast were built. <\/p> "},{"title":"Northwest sector","index":10,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p>The northwest sector is situated below and to the west of the north central sector (43.518&#900; \/ 09.650&#900; \/ 5060 m).
