Many Tibetan communities and monasteries around <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Lake Kokonor<\/span> were destroyed and Mongolians began arriving in <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15348\">Amdo <\/span>(<em>a mdo<\/em>). In 1257, three divisions of the Mongol army attacked the Song Dynasty. At the time, a group called Tum\u00e9 Darbho (<em>thu med dar bho<\/em>) came to <span class=\"place\" title=\"F23750\">Tsezhung<strong> <\/strong><\/span>(<em>rtse gzhung<\/em>) and they were responsible for providing army supplies, which were mainly horses.

A year later, most troops left and only two Mongolian groups, under Ho lo chi and Yung hro pu, stayed behind. In 1588, Ho lo chi ruled <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Repgong <\/span>(<em>reb gong<\/em>) and the areas around <span class=\"place\" title=\"F1179\">Mangra <\/span>(<em>mang ra<\/em>) with force. In 1636, Gushri Khan arrived in <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dom\u00e9<\/span>. His fifth son, Dargy\u00e9 Poshoktu (<em>dar rgyas po shog thu<\/em>) ruled a part of <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dom\u00e9 <\/span>and his third son Tsewang Tendzin (<em>tshe dbang bstan 'dzin<\/em>, 1699-1735), who was popularly known as Gyelpo Junang (<em>rgyal po ju nang<\/em>), was considered the first Chin wang, even though he was given the Jun wang title by the Qing emperor.
