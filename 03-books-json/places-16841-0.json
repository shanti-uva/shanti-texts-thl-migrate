It is built above a small watercourse. The entire structure is somewhat elevated above the surrounding plain. It seems to have single-course perimeter walls, but many of the stones have been pulled out of the ground. Some of the extracted stones now sit inside the enclosure. Dark-colored stones, 40 cm to 60 cm in length, which project as much as 30 cm above the surface, were used in construction. There is a double-course slab-wall fragment (3.8 m long) situated 18 m northwest of FS1. The parallel lines of upright slabs (10 cm to 30 cm long) are spaced 30 cm apart from one another. These slabs are level with the ground surface or project slightly above it.<\/p> "},{"title":"Funerary Structure FS2","index":8,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p>Funerary structure FS2 (7 m x 5.6 m), another quadrate enclosure, is situated 105 m north of FS1 (11.736΄ \/ 23.287΄).

Stones 40 cm to 60 cm in length were used in the construction of FS2. <\/p>  "}]}
