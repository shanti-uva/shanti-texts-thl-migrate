On the outcrop, which rises 4 m to 10 m above the surrounding slopes, are the remnants\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof a small residential complex. Its siting on an isolated prominence suggests that it belonged to the upper\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstratum of archaic society. The summit of the outcrop measures 11.7 m (north to south) x 2.5 m to 7 m. There has\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen much erosion of this natural feature and it may have been considerably larger at one time.

This revetment sheathes a vertical expanse of the outcrop up to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1.5 m in height. It has a cobble base and blocks laid in two diagonal courses near the top.

Certainly, this\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttroglodytic site is the largest of its kind in the environs of <span class=\"popular\">Bar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bar</span>. Nevertheless, all that can now be detected is a Buddhist installation\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(4370 m to 4450 m), which sits on a formation 110 m in height. This is said to have been a castle that met its\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tend long before living memory. <span class=\"popular\">Bardzong</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bar rdzong</span> was\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\talso clearly the site of an important Buddhist religious center, founded no later than circa\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1300 CE, as indicated by murals found in old cave temples at the site. The high point of <span class=\"popular\">Bardzong</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bar rdzong</span>, the east summit (41m x approximately 30 m),\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsupported a tight knit group of adobe buildings as well as four <span class=\"popular emph\">Ch&ouml;rten</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mchod rten</span>. The buildings were deeply inset (up to 3 m) into the central rib of formation and appear\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto have been largely secular structures rather than religious edifices per se. There are no explicit signs of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tchapels (<span class=\"popular emph\">lhakang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">lha khang</span>) among the ruins. Many timbers are\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstill an integral part of the east summit (as lintels, posts, beams, wall bonding, and substructures of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twalkways). There are four or five caves just below the east summit. What remains of the access route up to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\teast summit passes along the north side of the formation. A few caves are found along this trail just before\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\treaching the summit. A passageway off this trail leads to a single row of at least five caves. The same trail\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\taccesses the smaller west summit, which hosts at least ten caves. Various buildings are found here, particularly\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\talong the 20-m long western extremity of the summit. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>A trail from the west summit winds down to a ridgeline (35 m x 10 m) with a least ten more caves and a dense\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcluster of adobe building carcasses. In two other locations there are eight caves and four caves, respectively.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the most westerly cave of the latter group there is a large mural (2.4 m x 2 m) of what appears to be the god\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"popular\">Dzambhala</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dzam bha la</span>.

A steeply inclined tunnel 15 m in length leads up from the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbase of the formation (4340 m) to the first caves.
