No one knows the exact date of its foundation, but it is said to have been founded during the royal period (7th-8th centuries). The monastery was later moved to a place called Dar lung. The farmers who cultivate the land on both former sites have come across the ruins of the monastery. <\/p><p>In the 18th century, Kun grol \u2019Ja\u2019 tshon snying po (b.1700) moved the monastery to its present site with the financial support of the sMon rgyal family and spent the first half of his life at the monastery.

The last master of the monastery still remembered by the local people was A khu sPrul sku (1876-1943). He was a member of the sMon rgyal family and a disciple of Shar rdza bKra shis rgyal mtshan.
