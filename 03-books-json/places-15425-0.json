According to the 2001 census of Nepal, there are 359,379 ethnic Limbu who account for 1.58 percent of Nepal&rsquo;s total population, of whom 333,633 speak the Limbu language as a mother tongue. Limbu villages are found 2,500 to 4,000 feet (800 to 1,200 m) above sea level and consist of 30&ndash;100 stone houses surrounded by dry-cultivated fields. Divided into patrilineal clans, the families were traditionally led by a headman, or subba, who is often a returned Gurkha soldier. Maintaining a self-sufficient economy, the Limbu grow rice, wheat, and corn (maize) on terraced and irrigated fields; land is planted once a year.
