It is situated directly south of <span class=\"popular\">Dawen Rolpa Kyadün</span><span class=\"scholar\">Da dben rol pa skya bdun</span>, a lofty and important territorial deity (<span class=\"popular\">yüllha</span><span class=\"scholar\">Yul lha</span>) in the adjacent <span class=\"popular\">Zhungpa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gzhung pa</span> region. A rocky ridge encloses the north side of the site, while the views are quite open o the east and south. The terrain is fairly level, sandy and gravelly. <span class=\"popular\">Chutiku Mönkhang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Chu thig’u mon khang</span> consists of two large heaped-stone wall funerary enclosures. The perimeter walls are composed of uncut blocky pieces of white granite (10 cm to 80 cm long). The wo enclosures appear to have interiors devoid of structural elements. Like other sites of this typology, the perimeter walls have undergone a considerable degree of subsidence and dissolution. The many dislodged stones on he site indicate that these funerary enclosures were considerably more substantial than they now appear. </p><p>The relative locations of <span class=\"popular\">Chutiku Mönkhang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Chu thig’u mon khang</span> and the <span class=\"popular\">Dawen Rolpa Kyadün</span><span class=\"scholar\">Da dben rol pa skya bdun</span> range (maximum elevation 6282 m) may have had eschatological significance for the builders and users of the archaeological site. Perhaps <span class=\"popular\">Dawen Rolpa Kyadün</span><span class=\"scholar\">Da dben rol pa skya bdun</span> was seen as a protector of the funerary monuments and/or of those interred in them. The range may also have functioned as the celestial final resting place of the dead. </p>",
