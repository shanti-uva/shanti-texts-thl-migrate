The upper half of the rampart is composed of highly\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\teroded sod blocks at least 50 cm in length. This part of the retaining wall appears to have been around 1.5 m\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthick. The south rampart was entirely built of stone, and is 1.1 m thick and about 1 m in height. The remaining\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttraces of the east and west walls are of similar construction. On the south flank of the hill there are faint\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tremains of other walls. On the southwest side of the hill, a highly deteriorated defensive wall extends for 20 m\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tup to the summit. About 10 m below the east and north sides of the summit, a continuous level band (100 m long\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand around 5 m wide) was excavated from the hillside.

Foundations of small houses of unknown age are found in the valley bottom. Currently, the upper extent\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof cultivation (where barley fully matures) is found a few kilometers to the southeast, in the village of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"popular\">Drungkho</span><span class=\"scholar\">Drung kho</span>. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>On the very peak of <span class=\"popular\">Riwo Trazang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ri bo bkra bzang</span>,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trising 400 m above the valley, there is the temple of <span class=\"popular\">Lhakhang Ts&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Lha khang rtse</span> (4950 m). Between it and the lower but larger temple complex of <span class=\"popular\">Bar Lhakhang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bar lha khang</span>, there are a number of wall remnants\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat appear to have been part of an archaic rampart network. These traces of a stronghold are not connected to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBuddhist deeds or buildings in the sacred geographic tradition of <span class=\"popular\">Trazang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bkra bzang</span>. Although there is no local tradition\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tregarding <span class=\"popular\">Riwo Trazang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ri bo bkra bzang</span> being inhabited\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbefore the time of <span class=\"popular\">Guru Rinpoch&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ru rin po che</span> (8th\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcentury CE), the close proximity of a &lsquo;<span class=\"popular\">Hor</span><span class=\"scholar\">Hor</span>fortress&rsquo; suggests that it also may have been an important site before the period of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBuddhist occupation. The summit at <span class=\"popular\">Lhakhang Ts&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Lha khang rtse</span> has a much better panorama than <span class=\"popular\">Drakla Dzong</span><span class=\"scholar\">Brag la rdzong</span>; therefore, it seems likely that, at the very least, it\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfunctioned as a surveillance post for the fortress. The most prominent of the old defensive walls is found on a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tformation called <span class=\"popular\">Drak Buchung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Brag bu chung</span> (Little\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChild Rock), which is said to look like a mother holding a young child in her lap (4920 m). This structure\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconsists of two revetments interconnected by a parapet wall constructed above a rocky overhang (total length 7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tm). The two revetments each create a level area of approximately 25 m&sup2;. These structures were well built with\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthin pieces of masonry using no mortar, in the archaic technique of construction. They have undergone much\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\terosion and subsidence, which in itself is indicative of considerable age. Near <span class=\"popular\">Padma Druppuk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Padma sgrub phug</span> is a site called <span class=\"popular\">Tori K&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mtho ris skas</span> (Ladder of Heaven), a steeply inclined masonry ramp (1 m to 3\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tm wide and 10 m high) wedged into a notch in the formation. This also appears to have been a defensive feature\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfounded prior to <span class=\"popular\">Riwo Trazang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ri bo bkra bzang</span> becoming\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ta Buddhist center.
