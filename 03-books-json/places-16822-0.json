The site has fairly wide views in all directions, especially to the south. The terrain is level, well drained and sandy. <span class=\"popular\">Salung Möndur</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sa lung mon dur</span> consists of ten relatively well-preserved funerary structures that form a compact and integrated group. These structures are built of uncut light-colored pieces of granite of variable length (15 cm to 50 cm long). A number of different types of structures are found at <span class=\"popular\">Salung Möndur</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sa lung mon dur</span>, each of which is liable to have had highly specific funerary functions (both burial and ritual in nature). The various elements of the site are not symmetrically arrayed. The most elaborate and skillfully built structure is funerary structure FS1, a complex trapezoidal structure, which sits on the east end of the site. There are also five ovoid and sub-rectangular, heaped-stone wall enclosures (all with open interiors) (FS2, FS3, FS4, FS7, and FS8), and one quadrate enclosure with stones embedded along the perimeter (FS9). Additionally, there are three narrow rectangular structures of a type not encountered elsewhere (these structures are not aligned in the cardinal directions) (FS5, FS6 and FS10). Finally, here is a small ring of stones as well as obscured minor structural traces at <span class=\"popular\">Salung Möndur</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sa lung mon dur</span>. </p>",

In between the outer and inner courses, granite rubble was inserted as a filler to enhance the structural integrity of the walls. The interior of the enclosure is slightly higher than the adjacent terrain. In the middle of the enclosure there is a shallow rock-filled pit about 1.5 m in diameter. This depression may be the remains of a grave chamber. </p>",
