The undulating plateau is sandy\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand covered in turf and <span class=\"popular emph\">drama</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">gra ma</span> scrub. High mountains on three\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsides (including the Great Central Himalaya) constrain the view in these\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdirections. The southern vista, in the direction of <span class=\"popular\">puling</span><span class=\"scholar\">Spu gling</span>, is somewhat more open. gna&rsquo; ser thang consists of two large\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trectangular enclosures with predominantly heaped-stone wall perimeters. These walls are made of variable-length\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(10 cm to 40 cm long) uncut pieces of gray limestone and tan crystalline sandstone. This ostensible funerary site\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tis one of the few mortuary sites surveyed in the badlands of <span class=\"popular\">Gug&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ge</span>. Many <span class=\"popular\">Gug&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ge</span> funerary sites are\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlikely to have been covered by sedimentary deposits that dominate the geology of this region. Other burials may be\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconcealed in inaccessible caves. In any case, gna&rsquo; ser thang is the only example of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\theaped-stone wall enclosures found in <span class=\"popular\">Gug&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ge</span> to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdate. In addition to the structures themselves, the lofty aspect and physical conditions of the site resemble\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthose of the <span class=\"popular\">Jangtang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Byang thang</span>. These affinities are\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlikely to betoken cultural links between these two geographic regions and physiographic provinces. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>None was collected.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Site elements","index":6,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"West enclosure","index":7,"parent_index":6,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The west enclosure is generally aligned in the cardinal directions, and measures 13 m (north-south) x 29 m\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(east-west).
