At least in retrospect, two overarching classifications came to be the dominant subdivisions: the Four Cycles (<span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">skor bzhi</span>) and Three Piths (<span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ti gsum</span>). In contravention of the normative tendencies in Tibetan doxography, these two were not generally ranked hierarchically in relationship to each other, indicating distinct origins and development. Significantly, subdivisions increasingly were given abstract rubrics of identification rather than labels based on regional origins or personal names of founders, as was true for older Great Perfection traditions.</p> <p>In Experiential Precept Series texts we find in general a far greater role granted to death and intermediate process schemes than we do in earlier Great Perfection texts. The latter schemes play a central role, even to the point of having entire texts devoted to them. In particular, spontaneous visions of <em><span class=\"emph\">maṇḍala</span>s</em> dominate presentations of post-death experience, often under the rubric of the intermediate process of reality, which constitutes a fundamental transformation of Buddhist depictions of post-death processes. Other funerary issues also are dominant motifs, ranging from the ritual transformation of a corpse’s tongue to practices predicting impending death. The horrific environment of the Yoginī<span class=\"emph\">tantra</span>s is pervasive, and in addition there is a marked influx of presentations of ritual and contemplative techniques.</p> <p><span><br /><br /></span></p>","title":"An Overview of the Experiential Precept Series"}]}
