I was told that she was a Tibetan, from Chu chen in\n                        rGyal rong, and now she was the caretaker of the temple. The temple was\n                        rebuilt in the nineteen-eighties. It has close ties with gYung drung dar\n                        rgyas Monastery (No.170) in Rong brag county. The local people invite five\n                        monks from gYung drung dar rgyas Monastery to perfome an annual ritual on\n                        the 15th day of the 2nd month every year.</p>\n\n                  </blockquote>\n\n                  <p>Since there are no other religious activities apart from the ritual mentioned\n                     above, very few people come to the temple.
