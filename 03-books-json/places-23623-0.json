Sang rgyas dpal ldan, a Bonpo master from Central Tibet enshrined a statue of gShen rab Mi bo as the main statue of the temple together with two other statues --relegating the Guan di statue among the secondary deities-- and transformed the establishment into a Bonpo temple named mChog gsum lha khang.<\/p> <blockquote xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\"> <p>There were no lay devotees when I visited the temple in 1998, only an old lady looking after it.

It has close ties with gYung drung dar rgyas Monastery (No.170) in Rong brag county. The local people invite five monks from gYung drung dar rgyas Monastery to perfome an annual ritual on the 15th day of the 2nd month every year.<\/p> <\/blockquote> <p>Since there are no other religious activities apart from the ritual mentioned above, very few people come to the temple.
