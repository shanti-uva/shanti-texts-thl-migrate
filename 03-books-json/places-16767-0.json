It sits on clear, level ground. The probable double-course perimeter walls (around 50 cm thick) are flush with the ground surface, but only small traces remain. Sheep horns have been placed inside the fragmentary enclosure.

They were built on moderately sloping, rocky and gravelly terrain. These structures have been so heavily impacted that they could not be positively identified. Local residents deny their <span class=\"popular\">Mön</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span> associations, but their protestations do not seem very credible. It is said that this location was once inhabited by a woman from southern Tibet who built a corral here. FS3 consists of a dispersion that is 6 m across. A slight depression in the ground, encircled by dislodged stones, is all that remains. FS4 (5 m x 4.5 m) is situated 4 m south of FS3. Its downhill wall is elevated 1 m above the slope, while its upslope wall is elevated 50 cm above the slope. The remaining wall traces appear to be aligned in the cardinal directions. The middle of FS4 has been excavated to a depth of 1 m, probably in the search for valuable artifacts. Stones remaining in the vicinity of FS3 and FS4 are up to 40 cm in length. Larger stones have been carried off.</p>  "}]}
