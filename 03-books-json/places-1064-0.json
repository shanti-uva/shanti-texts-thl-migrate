There are 18 townships subdivided into 126 villages. The county covers\n                  an area of 3958.27 sq km. The population was 82,830 in 1980: 5,516 Tibetans and\n                  17,322 Qiang. The county town is located at Wei zhou Township 246 km from &rsquo;Bar\n                  khams, the capital of rNga ba Prefecture.

Wen chuan is a county\n                  of rNga ba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Sichuan Province. Since the Tibetans\n                  in the area are completely sinicized and no longer speak Tibetan, they use even\n                  Chinese names, although they acknowledge that they are Tibetans. The founder of\n                  the temple remains unknown. When I visited the site in 1998, the caretaker of the\n                  temple, an old Tibetan man called Ma Qingyun, who had been a soldier in the Long\n                  March, was the only person there who knew how to read some Tibetan. The temple was\n                  rebuilt in the 1980s. Only a small number of lay practitioners occasionally come\n                  to the temple to worship and make offerings. Ma Qingyun occasionally performs\n                  simple rituals for local families when requested. The temple has two copies of the\n                  gSer &rsquo;od nor bu &rsquo;od &rsquo;bar (xylographic edition), and one manuscript volume of\n                  various ritual texts. Economic circumstances of the temple depends on offerings\n                  from the faithful. Many people come to the temple to worship and make offerings\n                  although there is no local community as such. Occupation of the local population\n                  is farming.

In Xichang, the capital of Liangshan Prefecture, I met one aged\n                        woman from the village where the temple is located.

The\n                        devotees of this temple are mainly Mongolians but also include some Tibetans\n                        and Naki, and even some Yi, another ethnic group living in the area. The\n                        Mongolian army, of which the present Mongolians are said to be the\n                        descendants, arrived in the region in the 17th century with Gushri Khan.
