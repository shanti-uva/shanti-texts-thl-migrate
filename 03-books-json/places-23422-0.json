It is therefore apparent\n                        that the monastery was named Ser zhig after the family name of the lama who\n                        founded the monastery in 1405. Ser zhig Monastery is the biggest one in the\n                        Nag tshang Dwang ra g-yu mtsho area. Because of this, the Fifth Dalai Lama\n                        recognized it as a monastery of the government and permitted it to have a\n                        certain number of the local people as its retainers. The monastery is also\n                        called Se zhig skor lde, since it is one of the seven Nag tshang sger\n                        tsho.</p>\n\n                     <p>The monastery consisted of a two-storey temple, the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">bla\n                           brang</span> and monks&rsquo; quarters. There were many religious objects and\n                        books. Besides these, there were religious objects transferred from Nyi lung\n                        &rsquo;gram, the seat of &rsquo;Dzi bon dBang gi rgyal mtshan, when it was destroyed.\n                        However, invaded by the barbarous Mongolian forces of Jungar, Ser zhig\n                        Monastery was turned into a military camp, and the temple and monks&rsquo;\n                        quarters were soon destroyed.</p>\n\n                     <p>After that, a number of people launched themselves into its reconstruction,\n                        as well as maintaining the doctrine. They included the one called Zhang\n                        zhung Lama, a descendant of Gu ru lama, a lama of the Zhu family from &rsquo;Jed\n                        spang lung, a lama of the Shel zhig family and others. </p>\n\n                     <p>The main religious objects of the monastery were as follows: a black square\n                        stone called A ma sa gsum with the three white letters A, Ma and Sa on it; a\n                        small conch made of a devotee&rsquo;s teeth; a tooth of the sTon pa gShen rab&rsquo;s\n                        horse with a self-risen letter A on it; a Garuda&rsquo;s claw as big as a yak&rsquo;s\n                        horn; and a self-grown figure of Zhi ba Kun du bzang po within a crystal\n                        stupa.</p>\n\n                     <p>Besides these, the monastery had a small drum, which is said to be a present\n                        given to a Ser zhig lama by the local deity gDong dmar lha btsan of rTa sgo.\n                        Among the patrons of the monastery it used to be the custom for patrons to\n                        appeal to the abbot to let one of them beat the drum when the ritual Ma tri\n                        bum sgrub was performed, for it was said that if one could beat the drum\n                        three time, he might get rid of all the bad luck or misfortune of the whole\n                        year, and his wish might be fulfilled. The patron was expected to offer five\n                        silver tam kar and a ceremonial scarf for each beat. All the people in the\n                        neighbourhood, lay and clergy, both Buddhists and Bonpo, showed boundless\n                        respect for this drum. At mass meetings, three beats of the drum by the\n                        abbot preceded the chanting; only then was the prayer conductor to begin\n                        leading the chorus.</p>\n\n                     <p>In the protector&rsquo;s temple was a mask of the deity A bse, called Nga &rsquo;dra ma.\n                        This designation was derived from the words spoken by the deity to the mask\n                        maker, &ldquo;this mask looks like me&rdquo; (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">nga &rsquo;dra</span>), which\n                        turned the mask into an object of great rarity.</p>\n\n                     <p>It is said that there were many old, important religious objects in the\n                        monastery, such as the skull of sTon pa gShen rab with a self-produced\n                        letter A on it, his teeth with a self-produced Gu ru on them, a statue of\n                        sTon pa with a self-produced mantra <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">Om ma ti ma ye sa\n                           le&rsquo;du</span> on the upper right part of it, and armour that belonged to\n                        sTon pa (said to have been taken to Xian in China).</p>\n\n                     <p>The teaching and practice of this monastery have actually experienced rise\n                        and fall in every stage of its history. The recent significant figures of\n                        this monastery are as follows: Grags dbang Rinpoche of the Zhu family; sTag\n                        la dbang rgyal of the Zhu family; the lama called Zhang zhung mKhan po; &rsquo;Og\n                        tshom dkar po; and the young Shel zhig. The early ones are said to be in the\n                        &rsquo;Prang lugs lineage of Nag tshang.</p>\n\n                     <p>The monastery is administered by a lama, a prayer conductor, a <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">dge bskos</span>, a treasurer and an assistant. Besides them,\n                        two monks are charged, in turn, with the detailed tasks of religious\n                        activities, such as the accounts of Ma tri bum sgrub, and so on.</p>\n\n                     \n\n                        "},{"title":"Practice of Rituals and Religious Services","index":3,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n\n                        <p>Rituals are practised in the manner of the so-called sTod Nag tshang\n                           &rsquo;phrang tradition, prominent among other old traditions of Zhu.

At a good distance from the\n                           monastery, towards the range, at the foot of a hill, is a marvelous\n                           meditation cave called Shod tram phug pa. It was the abode of the master\n                           dMu Shod tram chen po, who was in the exalted <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">&rsquo;ja&rsquo;\n                              lus</span> lineage of Zhang zhung oral tradition. Near the cave is a\n                           spring filled with limpid water that is said to cleanse sins.</p>\n\n                        <p>At quite some distance up towards the rTa sgo mountain range, there is\n                           another meditation cave called rTa sgo rDzu &rsquo;phrul phug (the Miraculous\n                           Cave of rTa sgo); it is about the size of a two-pillared room and is\n                           shielded in the four cardinal directions by big rocks and overhead by a\n                           heap of big stones. It is also called rTa sgo gDong dmar lha btsan gyi\n                           phug pa, in which resided the yogi Nam mkha&rsquo; blo ldan, one of the three\n                           chief masters of gShen Nyi ma rgyal mtshan. There is a limpid spring\n                           beside the cave.</p>\n\n                        <p>Further up, at the top of the hill, is a lake called Nag mer mtsho, edged\n                           with piles of stones. It is a blessed holy lake with two different\n                           aspects: the external, which looks like the right eye of Dwang ra; and\n                           the internal, like the eye of mKa&rsquo; &rsquo;gro sKye ma &rsquo;od mtsho. Innumerable\n                           Buddhists and Bonpo, both lay and clergy, visit the lake to\n                           circumambulate it or to pay respect to it. It is believed that every\n                           pilgrimage site brings many blessings, especially in Tiger years.</p>\n\n                        <p>Climbing up into the mountain range, at a good distance from the hilltop,\n                           midway up the slope of the ice-capped mountain Ngo dmar lha btsan, there\n                           is an area where heaps of the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">btsag</span> (a kind of\n                           mineral used for medical purposes) can be found around the edge of the\n                           snow.
