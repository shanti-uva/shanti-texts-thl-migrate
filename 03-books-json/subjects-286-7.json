In cities, too, some youth sub-cultures have also developed their own sociolects.</p> <p class=\"Paragraph\">The term <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ལོགས་སྐད་</span> has a secondary meaning of “isolated” language, usually a Tibeto-Burman language that is close to, but mutually incomprehensible with, Tibetan.
