They begin with a collection of quite short texts known as The Eighteen Texts of the Mind Series (<span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">sems sde bco brgyad<\/span>, Semdé Chopgyé), and then subsequently proliferate into a large family of texts spawned by the original collection’s expansion, modification, and so forth, culminating in a series of texts centered on <em>The All-Creating King<\/em> (<span class=\"tibtext\" title=\"Type ID here\">kun byed rgyal po<\/span>, Kunjé Gyelpo). Most of the resultant sub-divisions of the Mind Series rubric have names based upon geographical regions, clans, or individual founders. Padmasambhava (eighth century) does not figure prominently – if at all – in these early Great Perfection traditions; rather, Śrīsiṁha (eighth century), Garap Dorjé (<span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">dga’ rab rdo rje<\/span>, seventh century?), and Vimalamitra (eighth-ninth century) are the main Indian figures cited as involved in their authorship, redaction, transmission, and translation.<\/p> <p>These texts exhibit a strict omission of all of the following elements pertaining to tantric Buddhism: ritual presentations, meditative systems with discrete prescriptive techniques, visionary practices of light images, mantric technology, subtle body practices and ideology, sexological rhetoric and practices, generation-phase texts and iconographic detail, and death\/funerary Buddhism with its associated violent, exorcistic ideology and praxis. These original Great Perfection texts are thus not death-centered; nor, in more general terms, do they provide much in the way of specification of actual praxis.<\/p>","title":"An Overview of the Mind Series"}]}
