   "body": "<p class=\"Paragraph\">Tibetan has several stative verbs or copulas corresponding to the verbs “to be” and “to have” in European languages. Two main categories may be distinguished: essential copulas, which denote an essential quality of the person or thing; and existential copulas, which express the existence of a phenomenon or a characteristic with the implication of an evaluation by the speaker.</p>
<p class=\"Paragraph\">The main essential copulas are <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">རེད་</span>, <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ཡིན་</span>, and <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">རེད་བཞག་</span>. The main existential copulas are <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">འདུག་</span>, <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ཡོད་རེད་</span>, <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ཡོད་</span>. Furthermore, these “essential” and “existential” stative verbs are associated with various evidential moods, as is shown in the table below. These are discussed in more detail below, in the individual sections dedicated to essential copulas and existential copulas.</p>
