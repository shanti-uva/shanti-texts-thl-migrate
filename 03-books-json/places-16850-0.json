Two specimens were rehabilitated to serve as <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma ṇi</span> walls. <span class=\"popular\">Gonkhor</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sgom ’khor</span> is well known in the <span class=\"popular\">Zhungpa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gzhung pa</span> region for its many <span class=\"popular emph\">ma i</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma ṃi</span> walls, built as acts of devotion by local residents in pre-modern times. Since the 1980s many of these shrines have been rebuilt. Uncut reddish and bluish volcanic stone slabs (mostly between 30 cm and 50 cm in length) were used to construct the tombs and to refurbish them for use as walls to support <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma ṇi</span> plaques. </p> "},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":" <p>According to elder residents of <span class=\"popular\">Gonkhor</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sgom ’khor</span>, these structures are the remains of ancient <span class=\"popular\">Mön</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span> tombs, which were converted into Buddhist shrines long before living memory. </p> "},{"title":"Site elements","index":6,"parent_index":2,"body":" "},{"title":"Middle summit","index":7,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p>In the middle of the flat summit there appear to be the remains of two cubic tombs spaced 6 m apart (31° 50.403΄ N. lat. / 82° 04.023΄ / E. long. / 4710 m). One of these specimens measures 2 m x 2 m x 50 cm.

These structures are situated about 3 m apart from one another. The largest specimen (2 m x 1.8 m x 1.2 m) appears to have some of its central depository intact. On top of this structure there are pieces of old plaques with worn <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma ṇi</span> inscriptions, creating a shrine that was built in pre-modern times. The design, construction and location of this structure corroborate its <span class=\"popular emph\">mön dur</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mon dur</span> attribution in the local oral tradition. It is longer and the stonework is of generally higher quality than the purpose-built <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma ṇi</span> walls of <span class=\"popular\">Gonkhor</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sgom ’khor</span>. The morphology of a second specimen, used to enshrine <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma ṇi</span> plaques, does not permit positive identification as a cubic tomb. The third specimen (1.6 m x 1.9 m) has been nearly leveled. </p>  "}]}
