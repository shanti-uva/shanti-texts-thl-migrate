There are also significant adobe wall segments on the site. The adobe blocks used possess the structurally sound dimensions of 40 cm x 20 cm x 10 cm. The adobe walls are around 50 cm thick and the stone walls are 30 cm to 50 cm in thick. Most of the 12-m wide east\/forward tier of the castle has been razed. Only sections of the downhill wall, near the north and south corners of the complex, are still intact. These wall fragments stand up to 3 m in height. <\/p> "},{"title":"Main tier","index":8,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p>The west\/main level of the castle is set at 5 m higher elevation than the forward tier. The 5-m high wall dividing the two tiers was built in two tiers, and appears to be over 1 m thick near its base. None of this wall is still freestanding. It must have once supported a substantial superstructure, adding at least another 2 m to he overall height of the complex. As much as 1.7 m of the upper section of this massive dividing wall is constructed of adobe blocks. The main level has a few remaining adobe and stone wall fragments scattered about, none of which stand more than 1.2 m above floor level. Most of the mortar and the adobe blocks have dissipated, obscuring much of the floor. The main level of the castle inclines towards the west\/rear, gaining approximately 5 m in elevation. This suggests that it may have contained different levels of structures. <\/p> "},{"title":"South wing","index":9,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p>On the south side of the main tier there is a separate south wing about 10 m in width (north-south). On its east or lower side this wing merges with the structures of the forward level of the installation, which is situated about 2 m lower in elevation. The upper portion of the south wing is set 3 m lower than the main level, and is bounded on the west and south by a lightly constructed masonry wall that rises 3 m to 3.5 m out of the ground. The floor of the south wing is largely obscured by rubble. Against the south and west wall are evenly spaced wall partitions, now no more than 1.5 m in length, which create the remains of a suite of five compartments. In the south wall there are the remains of three large windows with exterior masonry hoods built around them, sheltering their upper portions. Also in the south wall, about 1 m up from the ground, there is a small rectangular opening and a small triangular opening. <\/p> "},{"title":"Ramparts and revetments","index":10,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p>On the north and south sides of the mar dkar bya ru mkhar complex the ridge drops precipitously into the valley below. On these two flanks there are prominent revetments up to 3.5 m in height. Like the wall dividing the main and forward levels of the castle, the revetments were generally built in two steps, adding to the structural integrity of the complex. Below the west wall, natural rock spurs with the vestiges of ramparts extend into the adjoining chasm. The longest of these defensive wall fragments is around 20 m. Approximately 20 m below the north and west sides of the castle there is a sloping ledge several meters in width with traces of rampart walls (40 cm to 50 cm thick), which encircled its north and west flanks. On the north side of the castle, these rampart fragments stretch for 48 m and are as much as 2.3 m in height, 80 cm of which is freestanding. The remains of a 7-m long gateway wall protects the north ledge from the easy east slope access to the site. Given the substantial protective features found on the other approaches to <span class=\"popular\">Markar Juru Khar<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Mar dkar byu ru mkhar<\/span>, we might expect that a elaborate defensive bulwark once stood guard along the broad east slope as well. <\/p> <hr class=\"footnote-divider\" \/> "},{"title":"Notes","index":11,"parent_index":0,"body":" <div class=\"footnote\"> <a name=\"n54\" \/> <a href=\"#nb54\" class=\"note\"> [54] <\/a> Tucci, <em>Cronaca Della Missione Scientifica<\/em>. <\/div>  "}]}
