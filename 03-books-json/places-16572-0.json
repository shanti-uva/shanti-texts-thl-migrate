This limestone bulwark in the <span class=\"popular\">Arong</span><span class=\"scholar\">A rong</span> valley rises some 400 m above the east side of the <span class=\"popular\">Tri Tso</span><span class=\"scholar\">Khri tsho</span> basin. The high quality pasturage and plentiful\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twater of the <span class=\"popular\">Tri Tso</span><span class=\"scholar\">Khri tsho</span> basin and the adjoining\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlarger basin of <span class=\"popular\">Pangar Zhung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dpa&rsquo; ngar gzhung</span> (in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"popular\">Senge Tsangpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sengge gtsang po</span> flood plain) have been\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmagnets of settlement since early times.

The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttawny-colored formation of <span class=\"popular\">A Rong M&ouml;n Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">A rong mon mkhar</span> is very precipitous and inherently defensible. It has commanding views to the north in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdirection of the big basins. This site probably served as a refuge from attack and the final line of defense for\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe locality. Its inhabitants must have faced a very fierce enemy to have built such a high and isolated safehold.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIt is only accessible via the southeast branch of the <span class=\"popular\">Arong</span><span class=\"scholar\">A rong</span> valley via a steep and narrow slope. There are no signs of permanent dwellings at <span class=\"popular\">A Rong M&ouml;n Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">A rong mon mkhar</span>. The dry-mortar random-work\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tramparts were constructed using uncut hunks of limestone. They form a highly developed symmetrical defensive array\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ton the summit. It is unclear how the inhabitants of <span class=\"popular\">A Rong M&ouml;n Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">A rong mon mkhar</span> obtained drinking water. Presently, there is no water in the <span class=\"popular\">Arong</span><span class=\"scholar\">A rong</span> valley (except when there is snow melt or possibly\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tduring a heavy bout of summer rains). </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>According to local residents, <span class=\"popular\">A Rong M&ouml;n Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">A rong mon mkhar</span> was an ancient <span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfacility.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Site elements","index":6,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Upper summit","index":7,"parent_index":6,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The low end (4820 m) of <span class=\"popular\">A Rong M&ouml;n Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">A rong mon mkhar</span> is comprised of a breastwork that protected this constricted approach (only 3.5 m wide) to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe stronghold. Only two fragments of the wall built at this strategic juncture have survived (2.9 m long and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1.3 m high, 9.6 m long and 1.1 m high). This was the forward line of defense for <span class=\"popular\">A Rong M&ouml;n Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">A rong mon mkhar</span>. Above the breastwork the slopes rise to a saddle\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(4840 m) with a precipitous drop on its southwest side. The top end of this saddle connects to a narrow rib of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trock with the vestiges of a defensive wall and steps that lead up to the summit. This fortified access route\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinclined at 45&deg; is 21 m in length and reaches the southeast edge of the summit installation. The base of what\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tappears to have been a breastwork (3.8 m x 3.8 m) straddles the top at this spot. Although it is up to 2.5 m in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\theight (on its forward or southeast flank), no freestanding walls are left in this structure. This guarding\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgateway to the summit, the tallest structure remaining at <span class=\"popular\">A Rong M&ouml;n Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">A rong mon mkhar</span>, is likely to have been a significant defensive feature. It\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\taccesses the upper summit, which is up to 15 m wide. The remains of a parapet wall line the northeast edge of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe upper summit.
