The site is found on a wide open, grassy plain that gently declines in the direction of <span class=\"popular\">Drangné Tso</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sbrang sne mtsho</span>, a relatively small salt lake. Now reduced to fragmentary walls, <span class=\"popular\">Luma Drak Möndur</span><span class=\"scholar\">Lu ma brag mon dur</span> covers an area of 14 m x 20 m. The site can be divided into north and south sectors. The walls are made of variable length (primarily 30 cm to 70 cm long, maximum length 90 cm) light-colored calcareous blocks and slabs. These stones are level with the ground surface or project above it a maximum of 25 cm. </p>",

   "body": "<p>The north sector of lu ma brag dkar is comprised of a dense agglomeration of dissolving single-course walls that appear to have been part of two rows of small enclosures of various configurations. There were perhaps ten enclosures in a row, each of which measured in the vicinity of 1 m x 1.7 m. The south sector appears to consist of one large double-course enclosure subdivided into two or three cells. The north wall is the most intact feature in this enclosure. It is 12 m long and 90 cm thick. </p><p>In the vicinity there appears to be a wall remnant of another funerary superstructure (31° 29.845΄ / 87° 23.395΄ / 4660 m). Other minor structural remains may exist at this site. </p>",
