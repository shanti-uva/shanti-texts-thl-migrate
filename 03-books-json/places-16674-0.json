It is reported that the breakage of the pillar occurred in the last two decades. The broken part of the pillar is still found on the site. The sandstone pillar is highly eroded and has mineral depositions on its surface. A layer of conglomerate is cemented to one side of the stele, a highly unusual feature. The pillar stands 1 m east of the west wall of the enclosure.<\/p>  "}]}
