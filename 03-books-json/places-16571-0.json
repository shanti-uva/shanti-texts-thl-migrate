The core of the site consists of three highly dissolute wall fragments. Built at the base of crags, these walls extend for 30 m along the top of a small saddle. They appear to have been a frontline defensive feature for those stationed in the crags above. The random-work dry-mortar walls are constructed from uncut chunks of variable-length light-colored limestone. All that remains of the west wall is a small fragment (2 m long, 1.5 m high, 1 m thick). The central wall is 7.5 m long, around 50 cm high and 1.1 m wide. The east wall fragment (4 m long) is highly deteriorated. Above this series of three walls there are tiny races of other defensive walls in the crags. They reach a maximum height of 80 cm. On the north side of the saddle at the base of the crags there is what appears to be the foundation of a small defensive feature (1.5 m x 1.2). It is situated about 20 m higher than the three main walls. <\/p>"},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":"<p>Local residents call <span class=\"popular\">Dziden Chungba<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Brdzi gdan chung ba<\/span> an ancient <span class=\"popular\">M\u00f6n<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon<\/span> installation. <\/p>"}]}
