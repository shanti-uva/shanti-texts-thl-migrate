   "body": "<p>The minor fortifications of <span class=\"popular\">Dziden Chungba</span><span class=\"scholar\">Brdzi gdan chung ba</span> are found on a pyramidal limestone mount that divides the upper <span class=\"popular\">Dziden</span><span class=\"scholar\">Brdzi gdan</span> valley into two branches. This hidden location appears to have been constructed as a defensive refuge against attacks emanating from the valley below. <span class=\"popular\">Dziden Chungba</span><span class=\"scholar\">Brdzi gdan chung ba</span>, a place only of local importance, could only have accommodated a relatively small number of personnel. The core of the site consists of three highly dissolute wall fragments. Built at the base of crags, these walls extend for 30 m along the top of a small saddle. They appear to have been a frontline defensive feature for those stationed in the crags above. The random-work dry-mortar walls are constructed from uncut chunks of variable-length light-colored limestone. All that remains of the west wall is a small fragment (2 m long, 1.5 m high, 1 m thick). The central wall is 7.5 m long, around 50 cm high and 1.1 m wide. The east wall fragment (4 m long) is highly deteriorated. Above this series of three walls there are tiny races of other defensive walls in the crags. They reach a maximum height of 80 cm. On the north side of the saddle at the base of the crags there is what appears to be the foundation of a small defensive feature (1.5 m x 1.2). It is situated about 20 m higher than the three main walls. </p>
