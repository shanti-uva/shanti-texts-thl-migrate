The core of the site consists of three highly dissolute wall\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfragments. Built at the base of crags, these walls extend for 30 m along the top of a small saddle. They appear to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thave been a frontline defensive feature for those stationed in the crags above. The random-work dry-mortar walls\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tare constructed from uncut chunks of variable-length light-colored limestone. All that remains of the west wall is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ta small fragment (2 m long, 1.5 m high, 1 m thick). The central wall is 7.5 m long, around 50 cm high and 1.1 m\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twide. The east wall fragment (4 m long) is highly deteriorated. Above this series of three walls there are tiny\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttraces of other defensive walls in the crags. They reach a maximum height of 80 cm. On the north side of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsaddle at the base of the crags there is what appears to be the foundation of a small defensive feature (1.5 m x\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1.2). It is situated about 20 m higher than the three main walls. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Local residents call <span class=\"popular\">Dziden Chungba</span><span class=\"scholar\">Brdzi gdan chung ba</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tan ancient <span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span> installation. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n"}]}
