The site is located on a narrow bench, rising above the left side of the <span class=\"popular\">Ronggo<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Rong mgo<\/span> valley (a feeder of <span class=\"popular\">Tongtso<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Stong mtsho<\/span>), close to the <span class=\"popular\">Nakchu<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Nag chu<\/span> prefecture border. The sandy, partially turf-covered bench gently slopes down in a southerly direction, before dropping approximately 20 m to the valley floor. To the north, the site is hemmed in by a ridge, but in other directions there are wide vistas. To the south, <span class=\"popular\">Shel Gangcham<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Shel gangs lcam<\/span>, the principal sacred mountain in he region, is plainly visible. <span class=\"popular\">Khangmar Dzashak<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Khang dmar rdza shag<\/span> consists of three similarly sized and designed complexes: west, central, and east. There are also a few funerary structures dispersed between the west and central complexes. The three complexes are at a considerable distance from one another, an unusual spatial feature in this type of monument. This must be, in part, because the bench on which they were constructed is too narrow to accommodate the complexes side by side. <\/p> <p>As per the most common design parameters of this monument typology, both the edifices and concourses of pillars are aligned in the compass points. All structures are made from local brown sandstone. The exterior faces of the slabs and blocks used to build the temple-tombs were hewn flat, as were the faces of the standing stones in some cases. It would appear that the south side (down-slope side) of the three appended edifices was set on a plinth or underpinned by an apron wall. These supporting masonry masses are roughly 50 cm in height and perhaps extending 1 m laterally from the south side of each superstructure. Structural evidence for this constructional feature, however, is fairly obscure. The pillars are all naturally occurring pieces of sandstone that protrude a maximum of 80 cm above the surface. The pillars exhibit heavy weathering and support a considerable amount of orange climax lichen growth.<\/p> "},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":null},{"title":"Site elements","index":6,"parent_index":2,"body":" "},{"title":"West complex","index":7,"parent_index":6,"body":" "},{"title":"Appended edifice","index":8,"parent_index":7,"body":null},{"title":"Pillar array","index":9,"parent_index":7,"body":" <p>The most westerly pillar in the west complex array is found standing 5.5 m east of the appended temple-tomb. From that point, the dimensions of the array are approximately 26 m (east-west) x 12 m (north-south). Precise dimensions are unattainable because less than one-third of the original number of pillars are still planted in he ground. Structural evidence from other monuments of this type suggests that the rows of pillars probably extended in closer proximity to the funerary edifice. A portion of the southwest sector of the array has been destroyed by powerful erosive forces. There are a few dislodged pillars lying in the west complex array. As in he central and east complexes, the shorter pillars (15 cm to 25 cm in height) are squat and often pointed. The taller pillars are usually tabular but there are also some four-sided specimens. The average height of the pillars is between 35 cm and 40 cm. The broad sides of the tabular specimens are oriented north and south, in he normal fashion of the typology. Nine meters east of the current extent of the array there is a lone 60 cm high tabular pillar, perhaps indicating that the array was substantially larger than it now appears. In close proximity to this lone pillar there are small, highly fragmentary double-course slab walls. These are comprised of small stones set edgewise into the ground, which are more or less flush with the surface. These are the only slab walls visible in the pillar arrays of <span class=\"popular\">Khangmar Dzashak<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Khang dmar rdza shag<\/span>, although they appear with a fair degree of regularity at other large sites of this monument typology. <\/p> "},{"title":"Outlying funerary structures","index":10,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p>There are also more than four funerary structures at <span class=\"popular\">Khangmar Dzashak<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Khang dmar rdza shag<\/span>. The wide spacing of these structures, their limited number and their proximity to the west and central complexes of the necropolis has an exclusive air about it. This seems to suggest that they accommodated burials and\/or the contents of mortuary rites of individuals with a relatively high social position.<\/p> "},{"title":"Funerary Structure FS1","index":11,"parent_index":10,"body":" <p>Funerary structure FS1 is situated 70 m northeast of the eastern extent of the pillar array. Its superstructure consists of a slab-wall enclosure divided into two unequal-sized cells (5 m x 9 m and 5.7 m x 5 m). The slabs were laid in parallel courses to form walls 60 cm to 90 cm in thickness. Large stones, up to 90 cm in length and protruding a maximum of 40 cm above the surface, were employed in the construction of the enclosure. In close proximity there are the obscure remains of a smaller funerary structure. <\/p> "},{"title":"Funerary Structure FS2","index":12,"parent_index":10,"body":" <p>Funerary structure FS2 is situated 35 m east of FS I.

There is, however, a lone pillar situated 3.8 m east of the south side of the array, as well as a single small pillar well beyond the north side of the array. These outlying pillars probably signal that the concourse was at one time significantly larger than at present. The east array of pillars gently declines towards the east. The pillars are mostly tabular and have a mean height of around 35 cm. The shortest specimens are only 15 cm in height. By measuring the distances between extant stones in the rows, it can be estimated that only around one-third the total number of pillars are still standing in the east complex array.<\/p> <hr class=\"footnote-divider\" \/> "},{"title":"Notes","index":21,"parent_index":0,"body":null}]}
