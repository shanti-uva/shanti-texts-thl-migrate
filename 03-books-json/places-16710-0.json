The site is located on a narrow bench, rising above the left side of the <span class=\"popular\">Ronggo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rong mgo</span> valley (a feeder of <span class=\"popular\">Tongtso</span><span class=\"scholar\">Stong mtsho</span>), close to the <span class=\"popular\">Nakchu</span><span class=\"scholar\">Nag chu</span> prefecture border. The sandy, partially turf-covered bench gently slopes down in a southerly direction, before dropping approximately 20 m to the valley floor. To the north, the site is hemmed in by a ridge, but in other directions there are wide vistas. To the south, <span class=\"popular\">Shel Gangcham</span><span class=\"scholar\">Shel gangs lcam</span>, the principal sacred mountain in the region, is plainly visible. <span class=\"popular\">Khangmar Dzashak</span><span class=\"scholar\">Khang dmar rdza shag</span> consists of three similarly sized and designed complexes: west, central, and east. There are also a few funerary structures dispersed between the west and central complexes. The three complexes are at a considerable distance from one another, an unusual spatial feature in this type of monument. This must be, in part, because the bench on which they were constructed is too narrow to accommodate the complexes side by side. </p> <p>As per the most common design parameters of this monument typology, both the edifices and concourses of pillars are aligned in the compass points. All structures are made from local brown sandstone. The exterior faces of the slabs and blocks used to build the temple-tombs were hewn flat, as were the faces of the standing stones in some cases. It would appear that the south side (down-slope side) of the three appended edifices was set on a plinth or underpinned by an apron wall. These supporting masonry masses are roughly 50 cm in height and perhaps extending 1 m laterally from the south side of each superstructure. Structural evidence for this constructional feature, however, is fairly obscure. The pillars are all naturally occurring pieces of sandstone that protrude a maximum of 80 cm above the surface. The pillars exhibit heavy weathering and support a considerable amount of orange climax lichen growth.</p> "},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":" <p>The <span class=\"popular emph\">drok pa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">’brog pa</span> of the region report that <span class=\"popular\">Khangmar Dzashak</span><span class=\"scholar\">Khang dmar rdza shag</span> is the burial grounds of the ancient <span class=\"popular\">Mön</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span>.

The most intact wall segments are found on the south side of the structure; reaching a maximum height of 60 cm and are comprising four horizontal courses of masonry. Due to the very pronounced subsidence of the structure, the fabric of the walls is not discernable but they must have been of coursed-rubble, like the mortuary tombs of the central and east complexes. The stones used in construction are of variable length (10 cm to 50 cm in length) and are of the slab (3 cm to 10 cm in thickness) and block (thickness roughly equal to length and width) forms. On the east and north sides of the edifice, only wall footings have endured. On the west side of the temple-tomb, some wall fragments are still intact.</p> "},{"title":"Pillar array","index":9,"parent_index":7,"body":" <p>The most westerly pillar in the west complex array is found standing 5.5 m east of the appended temple-tomb. From that point, the dimensions of the array are approximately 26 m (east-west) x 12 m (north-south). Precise dimensions are unattainable because less than one-third of the original number of pillars are still planted in the ground. Structural evidence from other monuments of this type suggests that the rows of pillars probably extended in closer proximity to the funerary edifice. A portion of the southwest sector of the array has been destroyed by powerful erosive forces. There are a few dislodged pillars lying in the west complex array. As in the central and east complexes, the shorter pillars (15 cm to 25 cm in height) are squat and often pointed. The taller pillars are usually tabular but there are also some four-sided specimens. The average height of the pillars is between 35 cm and 40 cm. The broad sides of the tabular specimens are oriented north and south, in the normal fashion of the typology. Nine meters east of the current extent of the array there is a lone 60 cm high tabular pillar, perhaps indicating that the array was substantially larger than it now appears. In close proximity to this lone pillar there are small, highly fragmentary double-course slab walls. These are comprised of small stones set edgewise into the ground, which are more or less flush with the surface. These are the only slab walls visible in the pillar arrays of <span class=\"popular\">Khangmar Dzashak</span><span class=\"scholar\">Khang dmar rdza shag</span>, although they appear with a fair degree of regularity at other large sites of this monument typology. </p> "},{"title":"Outlying funerary structures","index":10,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p>There are also more than four funerary structures at <span class=\"popular\">Khangmar Dzashak</span><span class=\"scholar\">Khang dmar rdza shag</span>.

On its east and south sides, the edifice still attains a maximum height of 2 m. Given the fairly diminutive dimensions of the structure, its original elevation may have not been much higher than its current maximum extent. The coursed-rubble walls are 60 cm to 80 cm thick.

There is, however, a lone pillar situated 3.8 m east of the south side of the array, as well as a single small pillar well beyond the north side of the array. These outlying pillars probably signal that the concourse was at one time significantly larger than at present. The east array of pillars gently declines towards the east. The pillars are mostly tabular and have a mean height of around 35 cm. The shortest specimens are only 15 cm in height. By measuring the distances between extant stones in the rows, it can be estimated that only around one-third the total number of pillars are still standing in the east complex array.</p> <hr class=\"footnote-divider\" /> "},{"title":"Notes","index":21,"parent_index":0,"body":" <div class=\"footnote\"> <a name=\"n40\" /> <a href=\"#nb40\" class=\"note\"> [40] </a> The most important source for information on the oral traditions of <span class=\"popular\">Khangmar Dzashak</span><span class=\"scholar\">Khang dmar rdza shag</span> and nearby <span class=\"popular\">Ronggo Möndur</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rong mgo mon dur</span> (D-73) was <span class=\"popular\">Karma Tsültrim</span><span class=\"scholar\">Karma tshul khrims</span> (born Iron Dragon Year, circa 1940), the steward (<span class=\"popular emph\">gönnyer</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">dgon gnyer</span>) of <span class=\"popular\">Lowo Dechen</span><span class=\"scholar\">Lo bo bde chen</span> monastery.

In the local oral tradition, the <span class=\"popular\">Mön</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span>and <span class=\"popular\">Jangwa Hashé</span><span class=\"scholar\">Byang ba ha shes</span> are thought to have been closely related to one another, and to have long disappeared before the Tibetan <span class=\"popular emph\">drok pa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">’brog pa</span> of the region arrived. Given their northern designation and the orthography of the second word of the ethnonym, the <span class=\"popular\">Jangwa Hashé</span><span class=\"scholar\">Byang ba ha shes</span> are probably of north Inner Asian origin. A correlation with the ample archaeological and textual evidence demonstrating that Upper Tibet had manifold links with north Inner Asia in the prehistoric epoch (see Bellezza, <em>Zhang Zhung</em>.) may well be indicated. </div> <div class=\"footnote\"> <a name=\"n41\" /> <a href=\"#nb41\" class=\"note\"> [41] </a> Foot bones extracted from the FS2 tomb have yielded a radiocarbon age of circa 800 BCE. Tomb FS2: AMS analysis, sample no.

FS2 is interjacent to the east and central complexes, giving the impression that it was a constituent part of the necropolis. The relative location of the dated tomb remains suggests that the stelae and accompanying temple-tombs were an integral part of the same umbrella of funerary traditions. If so, it demonstrates that the Upper Tibetans were raising pillars contemporaneously with the Scythic tribes of north Inner Asia. This relatively early date (early <span class=\"emph\">Iron Age</span>) may also suggest that the arrays of pillars appended to edifices were built and maintained over many centuries. More chronometric data from such sites is needed in order to to refine our understanding of their origins, development and demise. </div>  "}]}
