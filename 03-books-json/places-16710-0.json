The site is located on a narrow bench, rising above the left side of the <span class=\"popular\">Ronggo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rong mgo</span> valley (a feeder of <span class=\"popular\">Tongtso</span><span class=\"scholar\">Stong mtsho</span>), close to the <span class=\"popular\">Nakchu</span><span class=\"scholar\">Nag chu</span> prefecture border. The sandy, partially turf-covered bench gently\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tslopes down in a southerly direction, before dropping approximately 20 m to the valley floor. To the north, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsite is hemmed in by a ridge, but in other directions there are wide vistas. To the south, <span class=\"popular\">Shel Gangcham</span><span class=\"scholar\">Shel gangs lcam</span>, the principal sacred mountain in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe region, is plainly visible. <span class=\"popular\">Khangmar Dzashak</span><span class=\"scholar\">Khang dmar rdza shag</span> consists of three similarly sized and designed complexes: west, central, and east. There are\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\talso a few funerary structures dispersed between the west and central complexes. The three complexes are at a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconsiderable distance from one another, an unusual spatial feature in this type of monument. This must be, in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpart, because the bench on which they were constructed is too narrow to accommodate the complexes side by side. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>As per the most common design parameters of this monument typology, both the edifices and concourses of pillars\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tare aligned in the compass points. All structures are made from local brown sandstone. The exterior faces of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tslabs and blocks used to build the temple-tombs were hewn flat, as were the faces of the standing stones in some\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcases. It would appear that the south side (down-slope side) of the three appended edifices was set on a plinth or\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tunderpinned by an apron wall. These supporting masonry masses are roughly 50 cm in height and perhaps extending 1\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tm laterally from the south side of each superstructure. Structural evidence for this constructional feature,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thowever, is fairly obscure. The pillars are all naturally occurring pieces of sandstone that protrude a maximum of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t80 cm above the surface. The pillars exhibit heavy weathering and support a considerable amount of orange climax\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlichen growth.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The <span class=\"popular emph\">drok pa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">&rsquo;brog pa</span> of the region report that <span class=\"popular\">Khangmar Dzashak</span><span class=\"scholar\">Khang dmar rdza shag</span> is the burial grounds of the ancient <span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span>.

A correlation with the ample archaeological and textual evidence demonstrating that\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUpper Tibet had manifold links with north Inner Asia in the prehistoric\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tepoch (see Bellezza, <em>Zhang Zhung</em>.) may well be\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tindicated. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"footnote\">\n<a name=\"n41\" />\n<a href=\"#nb41\" class=\"note\">\n\t     \t\t\t\t[41] </a> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFoot bones extracted from the FS2 tomb have yielded a radiocarbon age of circa 800 BCE. Tomb FS2: AMS\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tanalysis, sample no. Beta-187501; Conventional radiocarbon age: 2740 +/- 40 BP; 2 Sigma calibrated result\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(95 percent probability): Cal 2920 to 2760 BP; intercept of radiocarbon age with calibration curve Cal\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2840 BP; 1 Sigma calibrated result (68 percent probability): 2870 to 2780 BP. FS2 is interjacent to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\teast and central complexes, giving the impression that it was a constituent part of the necropolis. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trelative location of the dated tomb remains suggests that the stelae and accompanying temple-tombs were an\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tintegral part of the same umbrella of funerary traditions. If so, it demonstrates that the Upper Tibetans were raising pillars contemporaneously with the Scythic tribes of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnorth Inner Asia. This relatively early date (early <span class=\"emph\">Iron Age</span>) may also suggest that\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe arrays of pillars appended to edifices were built and maintained over many centuries. More\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tchronometric data from such sites is needed in order to to refine our understanding of their origins,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdevelopment and demise.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n"}]}
