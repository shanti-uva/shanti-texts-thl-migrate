The founder, <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dampa Deshek</span> (1122-1192), was a student of some of the most influential masters of the early <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Nyingma</span> and <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Sarma</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">gsar ma</span></em>) schools, including <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Gampopa</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">sgam po pa</span></em>), the first <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Karmapa</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">karma pa</span></em>), <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pakmo Drupa</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">phag mo gru pa</span></em>), and others. <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dampa Deshek</span> was born in a village called <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Belmo</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">'bel mo</span></em>; now called <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Serkhang</span> [<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">gser khang</span></em>]), close to where he would eventually found his monastery. All histories agree that <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dampa Deshek</span> was a blood relative of the important <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kagyü</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">bka brgyud</span></em>) master <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pakmo Drupa</span>, though there is disagreement as to their exact relation. The biography of <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dampa</span> composed by his close disciple <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dingpowa</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">lding po ba</span></em>; 12<sup>th</sup> cent.) says that they were born to the same parents, as do some later <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Nyingma</span>-authored works. Alternately, the <em><span class=\"tibtext\" title=\"Type ID here\">Blue Annals</span></em>, a <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kagyu</span>-authored work, acknowledges this claim but asserts that the two masters were only maternal cousins.</p> <p class=\"Dissnormal\">At age nine <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dampa</span> moved to <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pelkyi Chökhor</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">dpal kyi chos 'khor</span></em>) monastery in <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Ling</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">gling</span></em>), <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kham</span>, where <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pakmo Drupa</span> was also in residence. Between the ages of nineteen and thirty-six Dampa lived in Central Tibet and studied under many historically important lamas and learned <span class=\"topic\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dzokchen</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">rdzogs chen</span></em>), <span class=\"topic\" title=\"Type ID here\">Mahamudra</span>, <span class=\"topic\" title=\"Type ID here\">Lamdré</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">lam bras</span></em>), and <span class=\"topic\" title=\"Type ID here\">Zhiché</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">zhi byed</span></em>). Significant for <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Katok</span> were his studies in the 1140s and early 50s of the <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Nyingma</span> tantric traditions called the <span class=\"topic\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kama</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">bka' ma</span></em>). The <span class=\"topic\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kama</span> signifies the core scriptures belonging to the three “inner” tantras, and the commentarial, liturgical, and contemplative writings on them composed by Indian and Tibetan masters. <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dampa Deshek</span> also became a fully ordained monk. Notably, his biographies do not record him having any involvement in the treasure (<span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Terma</span>; <em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">gter ma</span></em>) tradition, which at this time was in an early stage of development.</p> <p class=\"Dissnormal\">At the conclusion of his training in Central Tibet two of <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dampa</span>’s masters gave him a prophetic order to establish a monastery on the site of a geographic formation resembling the Tibetan letter Ka. The name <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Katok</span> means, “above (the letter) ka,”  as the earliest structures of the monastery were built upon a cliff that is said to have a letter ka magically inscribed upon it. <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dampa</span>’s “eclectic” training was transferred to the monastery, where he taught meditation and scriptural traditions associated with the older and newer schools. For example, in addition to <span class=\"topic\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dzokchen</span>, <span class=\"topic\" title=\"Type ID here\">Mahamudra</span> was also a prominent part of the earliest training program at <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Katok</span>. It may be suggested that under <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dampa Deshek</span> <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Katok</span> Monastery had a pronounced <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Nyingma</span> cast but was not exclusively so. It appears that <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dampa</span>’s two main students – <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Tsangtön Dorjé Gyeltsen</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">gtsang stong rdo rje rgyal mtshan</span></em>) and <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Jampa Bum</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">byams pa ’bum</span></em>) – played formative roles in making <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Katok</span> unambiguously <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Nyingma</span> in character by elevating the <span class=\"topic\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kama</span> above all other traditions transmitted by <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dampa</span>.</p> <p class=\"Dissnormal\">At <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Katok</span> the <span class=\"topic\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kama</span> was strongly linked to the two institutional trends of monasticism and scholastic study. Proof that this constellation of elements – <span class=\"topic\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kama</span>, monastic discipline, and scholastic study – was chief to <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Katok</span>’s image long after its founding is found in the following quote about the monastery in the sixteenth-century classic of Tibetan history, <span class=\"tibtext\" title=\"Type ID here\">Scholar’s Feast of Doctrinal History</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">chos 'byung mkhas pa'i dga' ston</span></em>), composed by a <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kagyü</span> lama four centuries after <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Katok</span> was first established. This profile of <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Katok</span> appears at the end of the section on the <span class=\"topic\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kama</span> and is the only <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Nyingma</span> monastery profiled in that section. The final statement about the monastery reads,<a name=\"n1\" href=\"#fn1\">[1]</a></p> <p class=\"Indentedexcerpt\">“As for (the tradition of) these <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Katok</span> (lamas), because they primarily practiced the morality of the <em><span class=\"tibtext\" title=\"Type ID here\">Vinayavastu</span></em>, the monastery was kept clean and pure; because they propagated the conduct class (of scriptures), such as the <em><span class=\"tibtext\" title=\"Type ID here\">Bodhicāryavatāra</span></em>, they rectified (the study of) texts about the <span class=\"topic\" title=\"Type ID here\">Mahāyāna</span> path; and propagated all of the (teachings of the) authentic mantra. In particular the main (<span class=\"topic\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kama</span>) teaching of the <em> </em><span class=\"tibtext\" title=\"Type ID here\"><em>Triad of Sūtra, Illusion, </em><em>and</em><em> Mind</em></span><em> </em> abide here (at <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Katok</span>).”</p> <p class=\"Dissnormal\">Under <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dampa</span>, <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Tsangtön Dorjé Gyeltsen</span>, and <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Jampa Bum</span>, <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Katok</span> became a regionally important monastery. Thus when it came time for the <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kham</span>-born second <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Karmapa</span> to be ordained and educated his master <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pomdrakpa</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">spom brag pa</span></em><em>;</em> 1170-1249) sent him to <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Katok</span> for higher training. In fact, throughout much of the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth centuries <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Katok</span> maintained its scholastic and monastic vitality. This can be determined, in part, through the volume and quality of the extant writings of <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Katok</span> lamas from these centuries and the role of <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Katok</span> in histories from this period. During this time no other <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Nyingma</span> institution seems to have been as productive and well regarded as <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Katok</span>.</p> <p class=\"Dissnormal\">The biography of <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dampa</span> mentioned above does not attempt any general descriptions of the monastery as it was during <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dampa</span>’s time, but many of the details it records help the reader get a picture of the size of the monastery, its study programs, and bases of patronage. For instance, the biography mentions that at one summer rains retreat (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">dbyar gnas</span></em>) 900 fully ordained monks and 200 novice monks were in attendance. It is safe to assume that a percentage of these monks were not full-time residents of <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Katok</span> but were at the monastery only for the duration of the retreat, during which <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dampa Deshek</span> would give numerous teachings for over one month. The biography also mentions in passing that every summer <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dampa</span> convened a “commentarial institute” (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">bshad grwa</span></em>) for the study of the classics of sutra and tantra, and in the winter convened a “meditation institute” (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">sgom grwa</span></em>) wherein <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dampa</span> bestowed tantric initiations, instructions, and oral advice. The work portrays <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dampa</span> as a tireless teacher, which was clearly true, but goes so far as to claim that he taught thirteen individual sessions each day! The list of regional leaders who made donations for <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dampa</span>’s funeral ceremony suggest that he was well known throughout all of <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kham</span> and <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Amdo</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">a mdo</span></em>). The list includes the kings of <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Horpo</span>, <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Menyak</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">me nyag</span></em><em>; </em><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Tangut</span>), <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Jang</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">'jang</span></em>; ch. <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Lijiang</span>), <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Ling</span>, <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Tsongkha</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">tsong kha</span></em>), and <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Gyelmorong</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">rgyal mo rong</span></em>).</p> ","title":"Katok Monastery"},{"title":"Periodization of Early and Later Periods at Katok","index":1,"parent_index":0,"body":" <p class=\"Dissnormal\">Over its long history, a few different periodization schemes have been formulated to chronicle <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Katok</span>’s history. One explains the first few centuries as dominated by three staggered but partly overlapping lines of leading lamas: the thirteen lamas (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">bla rabs bcu gsum</span></em>), the thirteen abbots (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">mkhan rabs bcu gsum</span></em>), and the thirteen “Drung” (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">drung rabs bcu gsum</span></em>). The coherence of each lineage, and even the identity of its members are sketchy, but from a thematic perspective this historical model is quite helpful. Included among the so-called thirteen lamas are the founding lamas and certain later hierarchs of the monastery. The line of abbots refers to the great scholars from the twelfth through sixteenth centuries. It appears that both of these lines of lamas were meritocratic; neither familial nor based on reincarnation. In the fifteenth century a new line of leaders emerged at <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Katok</span>. They came to be known as the <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Drung</span> line (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">drung rabs</span></em>), with “<span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">drung</span>” being an honorific title of authority. The first <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Drung</span> lama lived in the fifteenth century and established at <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Katok</span> a hereditary line of uncles and nephews who maintained the monastic customs but under whose reign the scholarly traditions suffered. Post-seventeenth century <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Katok</span> lamas refer to the period spanned by these three lines as the “early period” (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">snga rabs</span></em>).</p> <p class=\"Dissnormal\">The traditional, emic periodization scheme of early and later periods, based as it is on lines of ruling lamas and their associated scriptural traditions, can be augmented with reference to contemporaneous regional political conditions. During the entirety of the early period <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Katok</span> does not seem to have been under the control of powerful local polities. During much of the early period there were several powerful political entities in <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kham</span>, such as <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Gonjo</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">go ’jo</span></em>) and <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Lingtsang</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">gling tshang</span></em>), but the histories do not place <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Katok</span> within either of their domains. Thus, although the traditional <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Katok</span> histories are based on internal concerns, we may note that the early period was also marked by a socio-political continuity in which <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Katok</span> was never the “state monastery”  of a local polity. Alternately, the beginning of the so-called later period coincides with tremendous political changes in the region; e.g., the rise of the Dalai Lama’s Ganden Palace government in Central Tibet and the local kingdom of <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Degé</span> – both in the early 1640s. <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Degé</span> quickly became one of the two or three most important political and cultural centers in <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kham</span> until the early twentieth century.</p> <p class=\"Dissnormal\">According to traditional histories the later period began after a decline in both the scholarly vigor of the lamas and upkeep of the temples at the monastery. Two lamas are said to have ushered in the later period: <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dundül Dorjé</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">bdud ‘dul rdo rje</span></em>, 1615-1672) and <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Longsel Nyingpo</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">klong gsal snying po</span></em>, 1625-1692). Both were treasure revealers and this is significant because prior to their arrival at <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Katok</span> the monastery treasure revealers had never occupied leadership positions at the monastery, although treasure traditions had been incorporated into the liturgies and contemplative practices at <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Katok</span>. <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dundül Dorjé</span> only stayed at <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Katok</span> a brief time whereas <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Longsel</span> lived at <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Katok</span> for perhaps twenty years and was by far the more consequential of the two lamas. Both <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dundül</span> and <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Longsel</span> were sent to <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Katok</span> by kings of the <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Degé</span> kingdom. An eighteenth century document clearly states that <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Degé</span> took half of <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Katok</span>’s farms and left the rest with <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Longsel Nyingpo</span> and <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Katok</span>, and suggests that <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Degé</span> was interested in imposing its own lamas on <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Katok</span> because the <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Drung</span> lamas were resisting paying taxes levied by the new kingdom on the monastery’s landholdings.</p> <p class=\"Dissnormal\">Several major changes ensued from the arrival of the treasure revealers at <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Katok</span> and the rise of <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Degé</span>. For one, there was a major administrative shakeup at the monastery such that the reign of the <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Drung</span> line came to an end, replaced first by <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Longsel Nyingpo</span> and his son and other descendents, and later by a number of reincarnate lamas (<span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">trülku</span>; <em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">sprul sku</span></em>). By the end of the eighteenth century, five or more reincarnate lamas originating from this period had risen to prominence at <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Katok</span>. They dominated the monastery for all of the nineteenth century and beyond.</p> <p class=\"Dissnormal\">Secondly, in the early decades of the later period <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dundül</span> and <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Longsel</span>’s revealed treasures eclipsed the <span class=\"topic\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kama</span> traditions that had been so prevalent at <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Katok</span> during the early period. Subsequently, in the last quarter of the eighteenth century and the first quarter of the nineteenth century the scholastic, liturgical, and meditative traditions of the <span class=\"topic\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kama</span> were reestablished at <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Katok</span>, albeit in new arrangement alongside the treasures. <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Getsé Mahapandita Gyurmé Tsewang Chokdrup</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">dge rtse ma Ha paN+dita ‘gyur med tshe dbang mchog grub</span></em>, 1761-1829) was the key agent behind this development at <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Katok</span>. In brief, <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Getsé</span> reformulated the overall religious program at <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Katok</span> by 1) reviving the <span class=\"topic\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kama</span>-based study program at <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Katok</span> (which had been more-or-less lost for over a century), and 2) composing new liturgies for <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dundül</span> and <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Longsel</span>’s treasures that fully domesticated them to mainstream <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Nyingma</span> monastic rituals. After <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Getsé</span>, scholastic studies at <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Katok</span> were dedicated to the <span class=\"topic\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kama</span> and the literary arts, the overall liturgical program was split equally between <span class=\"topic\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kama</span>- and treasure-based traditions, and the contemplative program at <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Katok</span> was primarily grounded in treasure traditions (especially <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Longsel</span>’s).</p> <p class=\"Dissnormal\">When the <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Nyakrong</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">nyag rong</span></em><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\"> </span>) warlord <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Gönpo Namgyel</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">mgon po rnam rgyal</span></em>, d. 1865) successfully occupied <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Degé</span> in the 1860s he wrought destruction on many monasteries and executed a number lamas. Perhaps because <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Nyarong</span> is home to many branch monasteries of <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Katok</span> <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Gönpo Namgyel</span> did not sack <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Katok</span> monastery, but he did take the main <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Katok</span> incarnate lamas hostage and imprisoned each one in different monasteries in <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Nyakkrong</span>. In the latter decades of the nineteenth century and early twentieth century <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Katok</span> monastery fully participated in the remarkable ecumenical (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ris med</span></em>) “movement” that issued from nearby <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pelpung</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">dpal spungs</span></em>) and <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dzongsar</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">rdzong sar</span></em>) Monasteries. Two lamas stand out from this period, <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Katok Situ Chökyi Gyatso</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">kaHtog si tu chos kyi rgya mtsho</span></em>) and <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Khenpo Ngakchung</span> (<span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\"><em>mkhan po ngag chung</em></span>). <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Katok Situ</span> is remembered in part for helping make the library and printing house at <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Katok</span> one of the main centers of <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Nyingma</span> literature in all of Tibet. He was also committed to improving the state of formal seminary studies at <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Katok</span> and invited the foremost scholar of his day, <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Mipam Choklé Namgyel</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">mi pham phyogs las rnam rgyal</span></em>, 1846-1912), to found a seminary at <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Katok</span>. <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Mipam</span> lived at <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Katok</span> for two years to train <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Situ</span> to be the founding abbot of the seminary, which was opened in 1906. <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Situ</span>’s <em><span class=\"tibtext\" title=\"Type ID here\">Collected Works</span></em> total 7 volumes and his literary output also includes his editorial work on several important texts in the<em> </em><span class=\"tibtext\" title=\"Type ID here\"><em>Collected Works</em> </span>of <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Mipam</span>.</p> <p class=\"Dissnormal\"><span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Khenpo Ngakchung</span>, also known as <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Ngakkyi Wangpo</span>, succeeded <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Situ</span> and was the abbot of the seminary for multiple terms, spending 13 years total on the abbot’s throne. Additionally, <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Khenpo Ngakchung</span> served as the abbot of the seminary at <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dzokchen</span> Monastery and other institutes. <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Khenpo Ngakchung</span> was also a notable teacher of <span class=\"topic\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dzokchen</span> meditation and several of his younger students lived into (or beyond) the late twentieth century and were important for keeping this tradition alive through the turmoil of the Maoist period. <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Khenpo Ngakchung</span>’s widely read autobiography is one of the primary historical documents for this period, as well as an inspiring guidebook to <span class=\"topic\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dzokchen</span> practice (the latter of which has been translated into multiple languages). In the teens and twenties of the twentieth century several Euro-Americans ventured through <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kham</span> as explorers, diplomats, or missionaries, but as <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Katok</span> is not on a major trade route and sits high atop a mountain, it appears that only one or two foreigners ever reached it. One of them was the missionary Dr. Albert Shelton and the lone photograph he took of <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Katok</span> is now part of the permanent collection at the Newark Museum and has been reproduced in David Jackson’s <em><span class=\"tibtext\" title=\"Type ID here\">A Saint in Seattle: The Life of the Tibetan Mystic Dezhung Rinpoche</span></em> (Wisdom, 2003).</p> <p class=\"Dissnormal\"><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Katok</span> was completely destroyed during the Cultural Revolution. It appears that the main temples were looted then dynamited, and the rubble was left to lie for perhaps two decades. When permission was granted to rebuild the monastery the rocks and salvageable materials from the old structures were reused to reconstruct the monastery. The driving force of the reconstruction efforts – which required considerable political and fundraising skills – was <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Moktsa Trülku</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">rmog rtsa sprul sku</span></em>), a high-ranking reincarnate lama of the monastery. After years in prison during the Maoist period he was “rehabilitated” and made an officer in the local religious affairs bureau, as was the reincarnation of <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Khenpo Ngakchung</span>, from which post he was able to secure the permits needed to rebuild the monastery to its former glory. Han Chinese disciples of Moktsa and the many other <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Katok</span> lamas have donated the majority of the funds for the rebuilding and unending expansion of the monastery. At present <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Katok</span> boasts an excellent seminary and more than three retreat centers, plus a vibrant festival calendar that features a very well-attended <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Padmasambhava</span> celebration on the tenth day of the sixth lunar month each summer.</p> <p> </p> <hr size=\"1\" /> <p><a name=\"fn1\" href=\"#n1\">[1]</a><span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pawo Tsuklak Trengwa</span>, <em><span class=\"tibtext\" title=\"Type ID here\">Scholar’s Feast</span></em>, (630.7): <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ka thog pa 'di rnams ni gzhi 'dul ba'i tshul khrims gtso bor mdzad pas dgon pa gtsang zhing dag/ spyod 'jug sogs spyod phyogs dar bas theg chen gyi lam gyi gzhung bsrongs/ sngags mtshan nyid mtha' dag dar zhing khyad par mdo sgyu sems gsum gyi bstan pa dngos gzhi 'dir gnas pa yin no/ spyir zur che chung las 'phros pa'i sngags pas bod khams gang zhing bshad nyan shin tu dar bas sngon bod tu mdo sgyu sems gsum las dar ba'i chos ma byung ba snyam ste</span>.</p>"}]}
