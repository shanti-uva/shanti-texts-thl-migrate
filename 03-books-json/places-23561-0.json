His son, Blo gros rgyal mtshan,\n                        succeeded him as head of the monastery, but the monastery was destroyed by\n                        fire in the second half of Nam mkha&rsquo; grags pa&rsquo;s life, (another famous head\n                        of the monastery). It was rebuilt during the life-time of Tshul khrims bstan\n                        rgyal. The monastery is believed to have been moved during bSod nams dbang\n                        rgyal&rsquo;s time and was renamed dBal khyuung gYung drung mthong smon gling. </p>\n\n                     <p>Here is a list of the subsequent masters of the dBal khyung lineage: dBon po\n                        A kru, lHun grub tshul khrims, bstan &rsquo;dzin rgya mtsho, Bla ma tshul khrims,\n                        O rgyan rnam grol, Bla ma blo bzang, Karma ye shes, bsTan pa rgyal mtshan\n                        and gSang sngags gling pa (1864-?).
