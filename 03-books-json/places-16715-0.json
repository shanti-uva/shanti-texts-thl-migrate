The view to the west is the most open at the site, but the southern and eastern vistas are also encompassing. The well-drained terrain is broad, level, sandy, and with some grasses. A small stream flows very close to the south and west flanks of <span class=\"popular\">Nyungkar Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Nyung dkar rdo ring</span>. The site consists of a small example of a single pillar erected inside a rectangular enclosure. It is very unusual to find this type of monument so close to running water. </p>",

These small stones were laid in multiple parallel courses in order to traverse the full width of the walls. There are also double-course wall sections (such as the east wall) made up of larger stones (up to 70 cm long). </p>",
