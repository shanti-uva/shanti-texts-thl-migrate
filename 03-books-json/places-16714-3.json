An attempt was made in the Chinese Cultural Revolution to restore water to <span class=\"popular\">Ng&ouml;yu</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dngos g.yu</span> but this project proved a failure. The loss of water resources for\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tirrigation can largely be attributed to the long-term desiccation of the <span class=\"popular\">Gug&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ge</span> region. Recently, two houses were built by herders amid the old\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tagricultural holdings. In close proximity to these houses there is a rammed-earth residential carcass (13 m x 7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tm) that has been converted into a livestock pen. Downstream of the benches on which the defunct farm fields lie\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthere is a bifurcation in the canyon.

Above the rammed-earth structure there is a stone building foundation (15 m x 5 m). These\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tresidential structures straddling the spur are said to be the castle ruins of a local chieftain, who had the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttitle of <span class=\"popular emph\">ng&ouml;yu chup&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">dngos g.yu bcu dpon</span>.

No authoritative oral tradition about <span class=\"popular\">Shedi</span><span class=\"scholar\">Shel did</span> could be collected.

The site was\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconstructed from red, blue and gray cobbles. <span class=\"popular\">Shedi</span><span class=\"scholar\">Shel did</span> can be divided into two sectors: northwest (170 m x 200 m) and southeast (90 m x 100 m). </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The northwest sector dispersion of <span class=\"popular\">Shedi</span><span class=\"scholar\">Shel did</span> is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdevoid of stone wall fragments. There is, however, a rammed-earth carcass (5 m x 13 m x 3.5 m) in the northwest\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsector. It is built on a prominence that overlooks the <span class=\"popular\">Dongpo Tsangpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gdong spo gtsang po</span>. The long straight walls and truncated west end of this\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstructure are in conformance with Buddhist temple construction, particularly that of the 11th to 15th century\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCE. The existence of this ruin confirms the testament of one elderly resident, claiming that a Buddhist facility\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tonce existed at <span class=\"popular\">Shedi</span><span class=\"scholar\">Shel did</span>. This high elevation\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tedifice appears to belong to a latter phase of construction than the superficial stone dispersions surrounding\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tit. The main link road in <span class=\"popular\">Dongpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gdong spo</span> cuts right\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthrough the northwest sector, and stones taken from it were used to line the roadbed.
