It has four sides hat are generally aligned in the intermediate points. The tip of the pillar has been partially broken. A few stones are scattered around its base. The base of a second, much smaller pillar (15 cm x 18 cm) is situated 1.45 m o the north. Reportedly, this pillar was broken by a youth in the early 1960s. A tabular stone (50 cm basal girth) that projects 20 cm above ground level is situated 75 cm north of the broken pillar. There are also two slabs fixed in the ground 90 cm north of the tabular stone. These slabs are 20 cm and 40 cm in length and protrude about 10 cm above ground level. The three projecting stones were deliberately planted in the ground. Given the scant structural evidence, however, it is not clear what type of structure these and other stones on the site may have constituted. <\/p> "},{"title":"Affiliated sites","index":7,"parent_index":2,"body":" "},{"title":"dNgos g.yu","index":8,"parent_index":7,"body":null},{"title":"Shel did","index":9,"parent_index":7,"body":null}]}
