Pirie translates <em>dewa</em> as &ldquo;tribal group&rdquo; or &ldquo;tribe&rdquo;; the term <em>dewa</em> is also used to refer to more recently established pastoral townships (Chi. <em>xiang</em>).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Sources:</p>\n<p>Fernanda Pirie, &ldquo;Violence and Opposition among the Nomads of Amdo: Expectations of Leadership and Religious Authority,&rdquo; in <em>Conflict and Social Order in Tibet and Inner Asia, </em>ed.
