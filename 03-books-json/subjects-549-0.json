<p>In pastoral (<em>’brog</em>) contexts, <em>dewa</em> is possibly used in more diverse ways. Charlene Makley, in the context of the Labrang cultural region in Gansu Province, suggests a rough equivalence with “nomad encampment.” However, Fernanda Pirie, who has worked in the Golok cultural region in Sichuan Province, reports that “nomad encampments,” as smaller residential groupings, are known there as <em>repkor/</em><em>rukor</em> (<em>ru skor</em>); the term <em>dewa</em> is used for larger groups, which are “united on the basis of territory, rather than according to a descent ideology” (larger groups that according to other authors such as Ekvall or Gelek are also called for instance <em>tsowa</em> or <em>shokwa</em>). Pirie translates <em>dewa</em> as “tribal group” or “tribe”; the term <em>dewa</em> is also used to refer to more recently established pastoral townships (Chi. <em>xiang</em>).</p>
