The terrain is comprised of a rocky limestone slope with around a 10° gradient. <span class=\"popular\">Sholopuk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sho lo phug</span> consists of three rocky tumuli, which appear to be funerary in nature. For one thing, their lofty and isolated location is characteristic of many Upper Tibetan funerary sites. These three conical mounds (1.2 m to 1.5 in height) form a north-south row that runs perpendicular to the axis of the slope. The amount of loose stones lying on each monument indicates that they had fairly high elevation superstructures. These appear to represent prominently elevated enclosures or small <span class=\"popular emph\">bangso</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">bang so</span>. They are composed of variable-length chunks of light-colored limestone.
