In addition, there are other \"knowledge maps\" which are just simple lists of items used as controlled vocabulary in such applications.Â  These may involve only a few options in one level, and so are not knowledge maps proper. Thus we have categorized those shallow controlled vocabulary schemes under a single header called \"Controlled Vocabulary Schemes\".</p>",
