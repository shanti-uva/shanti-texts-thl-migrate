However, even though ergative-absolutive constructions are not familiar to speakers of European languages, they are as logical as accusative constructions. The main point is that all languages need a mechanism or device to distinguish \u201cwho does what to whom,\u201d or, in other words, to distinguish between the Subject and the Object of a transitive verb. In nominative-accusative European languages, as well as in Chinese, it is not the subject that is marked, but the object, either by using a distinct accusative case marker (as in Latin and Russian), or by opposition in the sentence, i.e., being placed after the verb (as in French, English, and Chinese). In English, for example, word order is used to distinguish between \u201cthe <em>policeman<\/em> killed the <em>fugitive<\/em>\u201d and \u201cthe <em>fugitive <\/em>killed the <em>policeman<\/em>.\u201d<\/p><p class=\"Paragraph\">Tibetan chooses to mark not the object, but the transitive subject, by using a distinct case marker\u2014the ergative.
