FS1 is not aligned in the cardinal directions. It has unusually designed perimeter walls composed of small pieces of white limestone and a brown sedimentary rock (8 cm to 15 cm long), which were set in the ground edgewise. The perimeter walls are of the multiple-course variety and still exhibit quite a bit of structural coherence. Most of the stones in the perimeter walls are even with the ground surface, while some project above it as much as 10 cm. The two shorter walls of the enclosure appear to consist of four parallel rows of stones, while the two long sides have as many as seven rows of parallel stones. The central portions of the two long walls bulge out. </p> <p>Funerary structures FS2 and FS3 are situated under twin rocky mounts.

Variable-length (20 cm to 75 cm long) stones were used to construct the enclosure walls. These stones are even with the ground surface or project above it to a maximum height of 20 cm. </p>  "}]}
