This isolated hilltop has unobstructed views across the extensive <span class=\"popular\">Nyawo Tsangpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Nya bo gtsang po</span> basin. On its summit there is a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsymmetrical arrangement of substantial rectilinear footings aligned in the cardinal directions. These footings are\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdistributed over an area of 1000 m&sup2;. The symmetrical layout of these structures, their uniform design elements and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tanalogous erosive qualities indicate that they were built in the same general time period. Four rectangular\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstructures set in the compass points surround a much larger central structure. The well-built footings must have\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\toriginally supported significant superstructures. The regular alignment and straightness of the foundations\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tindicates the superstructures could only have supported wooden or semi-permanent roofs. The founding of an ancient\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfacility at <span class=\"popular\">Domra</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sdom ra</span> can probably be explained by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe presence of ideal winter grazing grounds and ample fresh water in the vicinity. Such natural endowments remain\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvery important to the contemporary settlement. Stones used for construction were finished and are between 20 cm\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand 1 m in length.
