   "body": "<p>In the middle of a large basin, just outside the <span class=\"popular\">Drowa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gro ba</span> township headquarters, there is a 120 m tall, flat-topped hill known as <span class=\"popular\">Domra</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sdom ra</span>/<span class=\"popular\">Tönra</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mthon ra</span>. This isolated hilltop has unobstructed views across the extensive <span class=\"popular\">Nyawo Tsangpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Nya bo gtsang po</span> basin. On its summit there is a symmetrical arrangement of substantial rectilinear footings aligned in the cardinal directions. These footings are distributed over an area of 1000 m². The symmetrical layout of these structures, their uniform design elements and analogous erosive qualities indicate that they were built in the same general time period. Four rectangular structures set in the compass points surround a much larger central structure. The well-built footings must have originally supported significant superstructures. The regular alignment and straightness of the foundations indicates the superstructures could only have supported wooden or semi-permanent roofs. The founding of an ancient facility at <span class=\"popular\">Domra</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sdom ra</span> can probably be explained by he presence of ideal winter grazing grounds and ample fresh water in the vicinity. Such natural endowments remain very important to the contemporary settlement. Stones used for construction were finished and are between 20 cm and 1 m in length.
