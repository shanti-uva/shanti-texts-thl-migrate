The site occupies a sandy flat in the valley bottom. On a formation at the edge of the valley is <span class=\"popular\">Kolog Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ko logs mkhar</span> (A-125), the ruins of an archaic stronghold. <span class=\"popular\">Kolok</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ko logs</span> consists of five double-course enclosures, which are not aligned in the cardinal directions. These enclosures were primarily built of unhewn light-colored pieces of granite of variable length. The enclosures are all very fragmentary, which is probably linked to the construction of an old pastoral camp at the site (it appears to contain stones extracted from the funerary structures). The site is now endangered again by the reestablishment of a pastoral camp by two families, which recently emigrated here from <span class=\"popular\">Gyamuk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rgya smug</span>.</p>",
