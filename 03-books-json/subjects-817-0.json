The Four Noble Truths are: suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path. The aim is that sentient beings should seek liberation from cyclical existence. While teaching that all people lack any inherent self, these texts do not critique the notion that phenomena can be established in their own right as the base of linguistic reference and conceptualization.
