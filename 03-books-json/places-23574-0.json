The\n                        monastery was moved to its present site by a master called gDan khri for an\n                        unknown reason. According to a legend recorded by gNyags Chos nyid rdo rje\n                        (gYung drung bde ldan gling, MS., p.1), in the thirteenth Rab byung\n                        (1747-1806), dGongs rtse gYung drung tshul khrims, who had studied at sMan\n                        ri, occupied the monastery&rsquo;s throne. One night, one of his boots disappeared\n                        and was found on a dune on the bank of the Yangtze river. dGongs rtse gYung\n                        drung tshul khrims took this as a prophecy and thus moved the monastery to\n                        the place where the boot was rediscovered, which is the present site of the\n                        monastery.
