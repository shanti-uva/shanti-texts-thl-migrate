It consists of two highly eroded exterior walls of a building, which run the breadth of a narrow shelf. Undoubtedly, much of this structure has long since disappeared down the steep slopes of the mountainside. The site is interconnected to an esplanade called <span class=\"popular\">Buk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sbug</span>, which is elevated above a long stretch of the <span class=\"popular\">Dosham</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mdo gsham</span> valley. <span class=\"popular\">Dosham Mön Gi Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mdo gsham mon gyi mkhar</span> has a fairly good defensive position overlooking agricultural lands on the opposite side of the valley. The so-called <span class=\"popular emph\">khar</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mkhar</span> is also located on the opposite side of the valley from a ruined Buddhist monastery known locally as <span class=\"popular\">Jampa Teluk</span><span class=\"scholar\">’Byams pa lte lugs</span> (said to be named for a large <span class=\"popular\">Jampa</span><span class=\"scholar\">’Byams pa</span> statute with a prominent navel that was once enshrined here). </p>

The highest exterior point of the walls is 2.5 m and the highest interior face rises 1.5 m. The walls have been reduced to 20 cm or less in thickness near the top and 40 cm or less at the base. The adobe contains a high proportion of gravel and small cobbles. The joints of the adobe blocks are still visible in a few places. These small building blocks are just 20 cm long and 10 cm high. </p>
