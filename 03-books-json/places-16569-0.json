   "body": "<p>The single earthen hulk of <span class=\"popular\">Kharchung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mkhar chung</span> is situated on a relatively flat summit suspended 130 m above the <span class=\"popular\">Drel Dongpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bral gdong po</span> valley floor. The access routes to the site must pass through the difficult earthen and gravel formations that surround it. The north and west sides of <span class=\"popular\">Kharchung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mkhar chung</span> are protected by steep gullies and other sides by sheer drops. To the north a flat-topped ridgeline is connected to the steep slopes that rise out of the badland canyons to the broad esplanade abutting the <span class=\"popular\">Ayi La</span><span class=\"scholar\">A yi la</span> Transhimalayan range. <span class=\"popular\">Kharchung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mkhar chung</span> is invested with a commanding position in that all of the surrounding esplanade is visible from this vantage point. Unlike Buddhist sites in the <span class=\"popular\">Drel Dongpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bral gdong po</span> valley, <span class=\"popular\">Kharchung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mkhar chung</span>appears to have had a defensive function, just as its name suggests. It is a long, narrow structure reminiscent of the lone buildings of <span class=\"popular\">Manam Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ma nam mkhar</span> (West) (B-77) and <span class=\"popular\">Ha La Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ha la mkhar</span> (West) (A-58). All three of these sites feature two or three long rows of small rooms oriented along he axis of the building. <span class=\"popular\">Kharchung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mkhar chung</span> is likely to be an archaic cultural site because of the oral tradition associated with it, the lack of Buddhist emblems, the high elevation location, the highly disintegrated state of the ruins (it is much more degraded than the Buddhist structures in the area), and its unusual design characteristics. </p>",

   "body": "<p> <span class=\"popular\">Kharchung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mkhar chung</span> measures 55 m (east-west) x 7 m (north-south) and is quite closely aligned in the compass points. Its width is hard to determine as only a 2.5-m long segment of the south wall is still intact. The edifice dips slightly in elevation from east to west. Standing walls reach a maximum height of 3 m and are highly eroded to 50 cm or less in thickness. They appear to be constructed of rammed-earth (traces of the orifices used to hold the shuttering pins are visible). The walls of <span class=\"popular\">Kharchung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mkhar chung</span> contain copious amounts of a stone matrix. The base of the walls is comprised of several vertical courses of multicolored cobbles and brown sandstone blocks and slabs (10 cm to 50 cm in length). The revetment on the north side of the edifice is of the same type of stonework and is around 1 m in height. </p><p>The north wall of <span class=\"popular\">Kharchung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mkhar chung</span> is fairly continuous except for a gap 15 m wide near its west end. The traces of the stone revetment embedded in the north rim of the formation near this gap, however, shows that the north wall was originally continuous. Near the east end of the gap the north wall makes two 90° bends to the south, each 1.3 m in length. At the east end of <span class=\"popular\">Kharchung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mkhar chung</span>, along the rim of the formation, here are the faint remains of a wall that appears to have protected this flank of the installation from the gully below. A tiny extant segment of this wall suggests it was around 75 cm thick. Little of the west wall of <span class=\"popular\">Kharchung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mkhar chung</span> is still intact. Much earth is heaped up against the east wall, obliterating any traces of room partitions that might have survived. The only surviving south wall segment is a masonry structure that was heavily mud mortared. This fragment (2.5 m long and 1.5 m in height) is composed of sandstone blocks and metamorphic cobbles. </p>",

   "body": "<p>There are two ruined Buddhist complexes in the <span class=\"popular\">Drel Dongpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bral gdong po</span> valley, north and south. The oldest one,<span class=\"popular\">Drel Dongpo Gönpa Lhoma</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bral gdong po dgon pa lho ma</span>, is situated on the south side of the valley (31° 31.8΄ N. lat. / 79° 54.5΄ E. long. / 4120 m). It is perched on a series of benches elevated 30 m above the valley floor. An older foundation date for the south monastic complex is supported by the local oral tradition. The largest group of ruined <span class=\"popular emph\">Chörten</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mchod rten</span> and the main temple of the south site appear to date to the <span class=\"popular emph\">tenpa chidar</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">bstan pa phyi dar</span> (or shortly thereafter). The temple, with its multiple transverse spans, is of a design typical of early <span class=\"popular\">Gugé</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ge</span> Buddhist architecture. There are also a number of outlying <span class=\"popular emph\">Chörten</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mchod rten</span> complexes at <span class=\"popular\">Drel Dongpo Gönpa Lhoma</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bral gdong po dgon pa lho ma</span>. The most unusual feature of this Buddhist center is that it is surrounded on three sides by stone walls (built primarily of sandstone blocks), which are topped by a series of rounded masonry structures similar in shape to the <span class=\"popular emph\">bhumpa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">bum pa</span> of <span class=\"popular emph\">Chörten</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mchod rten</span>. There are scores of these interconnected structures extending for hundreds of meters. None of the surmounting structures are complete (total height of the walls has been reduced to 1.5 m or less). We might conjecture that the walls of <span class=\"popular emph\">Chörten</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mchod rten</span>-like structures were covered in a mud veneer and lavishly painted. These walls are situated behind (to the south of) <span class=\"popular\">Drel Dongpo Gönpa Lhoma</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bral gdong po dgon pa lho ma</span> and to its east and west. An analogous wall is found further west. The axes of these walls are oriented parallel to the slope of the benches upon which they were built, that is, towards the north Buddhist complex of <span class=\"popular\">Drel Dongpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bral gdong po</span>. The <span class=\"popular emph\">Chörten</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mchod rten</span>-like walls are arrayed in such a way that from <span class=\"popular\">Drel Dongpo Gönpa Lhoma</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bral gdong po dgon pa lho ma</span> they seem o embrace both formations of the north Buddhist complex. These intricately constructed walls, at least in part, may have been built to subdue inimical influences coming from the direction of what became the north Buddhist complex, the original nucleus of settlement in <span class=\"popular\">Drel Dongpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bral gdong po</span>. </p>",

In the earthen formation bounding he right side of the valley there are around 100 caves, which were probably the original locus of settlement at <span class=\"popular\">drinsa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Drin sa</span>. It would appear that at some point in time, this preexisting cave complex was transformed into a Buddhist center. On the summit of the formation with the caves there is a significant rammed-earth shell with tall, straight walls. The Buddhist hierarch or chieftain of the locale may have occupied this high status redoubt. In a cave near the base of the <span class=\"popular\">drinsa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Drin sa</span> formation here are murals dating to circa 1000 to 1200 CE (painted in a provincial and somewhat naive style probably by native Tibetan artists).
