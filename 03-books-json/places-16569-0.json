The access routes to the site must pass through the difficult earthen and gravel formations that surround it. The north and west sides of <span class=\"popular\">Kharchung<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Mkhar chung<\/span> are protected by steep gullies and other sides by sheer drops. To the north a flat-topped ridgeline is connected to the steep slopes that rise out of the badland canyons to the broad esplanade abutting the <span class=\"popular\">Ayi La<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">A yi la<\/span> Transhimalayan range. <span class=\"popular\">Kharchung<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Mkhar chung<\/span> is invested with a commanding position in that all of the surrounding esplanade is visible from this vantage point. Unlike Buddhist sites in the <span class=\"popular\">Drel Dongpo<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Bral gdong po<\/span> valley, <span class=\"popular\">Kharchung<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Mkhar chung<\/span>appears to have had a defensive function, just as its name suggests.
