The revetment on the north side of the edifice is of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsame type of stonework and is around 1 m in height. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The north wall of <span class=\"popular\">Kharchung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mkhar chung</span> is fairly\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcontinuous except for a gap 15 m wide near its west end.

Near the east\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tend of the gap the north wall makes two 90&deg; bends to the south, each 1.3 m in length.

It is perched on a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tseries of benches elevated 30 m above the valley floor. An older foundation date for the south monastic complex\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tis supported by the local oral tradition. The largest group of ruined <span class=\"popular emph\">Ch&ouml;rten</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mchod rten</span> and the main temple of the south site appear to date to the <span class=\"popular emph\">tenpa chidar</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">bstan pa phyi dar</span> (or shortly thereafter). The temple, with its\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmultiple transverse spans, is of a design typical of early <span class=\"popular\">Gug&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ge</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBuddhist architecture.
