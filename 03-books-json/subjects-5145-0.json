In the former case, the tense-aspect of the verb is unspecified, and must be deduced from the context. Thus the sentence &ldquo;Who is the person who is smoking (or who smokes)&rdquo; could just as well be translated by the imperfective past as &ldquo;Who is the person who was smoking? (or who used to smoke?)&rdquo; or the past perfective, &ldquo;Who is the person who (has) smoked?&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"Paragraph\">By contrast, when the nominalizer is used with an intransitive verb, it indicates the present or the future (or else the imperfective past). To indicate the past (perfective) corresponding to the English perfect or preterite, Tibetan uses the nominalizer <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">པ་</span>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"\\\">འགྲོ་མཁན་</span> &ldquo;The person who is going, goes, will go, was going&rdquo;</li>\n<li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">བསྡད་མཁན་</span> &ldquo;The person who is staying, who stays, will stay, was staying&rdquo;</li>\n<li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ཕྱིན་པ་</span> &ldquo;The person who went, has gone&rdquo;</li>\n<li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">བསྡད་པ་</span> &ldquo;The person who stayed, has stayed&rdquo;</li>\n</ul>","title":""}]}
