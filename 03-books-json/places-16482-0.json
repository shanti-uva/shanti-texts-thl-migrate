The existence of a stone-roof in one section of the building and its general design and constructional characteristics indicate that it was an all-stone corbelled structure. The four main walls of rdzong pi phi are quite closely aligned in the cardinal directions and each measure 4.5 m in length. A fifth or southwest wall facet is 2.2 m in length. The random-rubble block-work walls (50 cm to 60 cm thick) appear to have been lightly mortared. Variable-sized slabs were used to build the walls, a common archaic style of construction. The walls rise up to a height of 3 m to 4 m on the exterior side and 2 m to 2.5 m internally. The entranceway was in the south. There are windows in the north wall (20 cm x 30 cm) and east wall (30 cm x 35 cm). A southwest room has survived largely intact while other internal partitions have been nearly effaced. The southwest room (outer dimensions: 2 m x 2.5 m) is set 50 cm below the rest of the floor level. An opening in the lower portion of its outer wall may indicate hat it functioned as a lavatory. The roof of the southwest room is entirely intact: two bridging stones (each more than 1.5 m long) support the stone-slab roof sheathing.</p>",

Approximately 200 m southwest of the summit edifice there is a cave (3.5 m deep) with the remnants of a stone façade (3 m long). In the rear of this cave there are niches and a stone bench hat could have had either utilitarian or ritual functions. The cave is now used to store the belongings of a local <span class=\"popular emph\">drok pa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">’brog pa</span> family such as winter coats. Long ago a hole was bored into the roof of this cave, ostensibly as a smoke vent.

  {
   "body": "<p>The lower site of <span class=\"popular\">Dzong Pipi</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdzong pi phi</span> is situated below the stronghold, on the east side of the formation. It is dominated by a narrow cave (6.5 m deep), which has a three-story stonewall built around its mouth. This structure was made of variable-sized stone slabs laid in random-work courses, which appear to have been lightly mortared. The lowest tier of the outer wall incorporates a stairway that is now almost completely destroyed. At the base of the stairway there is a landing. The middle level of the façade contains the entranceway, which is 1.7 m in height and 60 cm wide on its exterior side. There are several steps set inside the entranceway (1 m long), which access a much smaller inner portal. The 1-m long lintel over the entranceway is the largest stone used in the construction of the façade. The upper level of the façade encloses much of the cave and supports a small window. The middle and upper levels of the façade form a single masonry expanse 5.4 m in height and nearly 3 m in width.</p><p>Near the entranceway of the cave, <span class=\"popular emph\">Om A Hum</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">oṃ a hum</span> and a counterclockwise swastika were inscribed in red ochre in a vertical row. Nearby there is another red ochre counterclockwise swastika. In the formation above the façade there is a red ochre clockwise swastika, and a <span class=\"popular emph\">Wuchen</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">dbu can</span> inscription that seems to read: <span class=\"popular emph\">Jenso nampé chi</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">jan gso nam pa 'chi</span>. This inscription appears to convey the Buddhist depreciation of the site. In the rear of the cave there is a panel consisting of a red ochre sun and moon, a tree-like depiction, two rudimentary specimens of the letter <span class=\"popular emph\">a</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">a</span>, and several heavily obscured compositions, all of which form a horizontal array. Like the letters and swastikas near the entrance, this panel was almost certainly painted by the Bonpo. The motifs on the panel, on the basis of style and paleography, however, seem significantly older than the pictographs near the entrance. The existence of these letters and symbols establishes the Bon occupation of <span class=\"popular\">Dzong Pipi</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdzong pi phi</span>, a period of tenure that must be related to the local tale of the <span class=\"popular emph\">sinmo</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">srin mo</span>.</p>",
