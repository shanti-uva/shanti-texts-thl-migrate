Because it lacks a formal mark, the absolutive in Tibetan isn’t always easy to identify at first. Remember that a case marker is always to be found at the end of any noun group (or phrase).</p> <p class=\"Paragraph\">The absolutive indicates the grammatical <strong>role of patient</strong>. This role typically refers to the animate or inanimate participant that undergoes or suffers a given action performed by an agent (in the case of transitive verbs), or a single participant in a process (in the case of intransitive verbs). The role of patient also includes the experiencer of an emotion.</p> <p class=\"Paragraph\">In syntactic or relational terms, the absolutive designates both <strong>the object of a transitive verb</strong> and <strong>the subject of an intransitive verb</strong>.</p> <ul> <li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ཇ་འཐུངས།</span> “Drink the tea.” </li> <li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ཇ་ཚ་པོ་འདུག</span> “The tea is hot.”</li> </ul> <p>In both these examples, the “tea” (<span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ཇ་</span>) is in the absolutive case. However, in the first sentence it is a direct object, while in the second it is the subject of the verb. By contrast, the subject of a transitive verb would be marked by the agentive case.</p>","title":""}]}
