However, during the time of Tanglung Gorgen (mgo rgan), who was the leader of Tanglung in the early twentieth century, they became hostile to each other due to a conflict between Mokri (rmog ri) Monastery in Zamtsa and the Zamtsa P\u00f6npo. Shitsang and Tanglung took the side of Mokri Monastery, which forced the Zamtsa P\u00f6npo to seek support from the local Guomindang officials. The Guomindang officials sent an army against Shitsang and Tanglung, and Shitsang Monastery was burned down. Because Tanglung Gowa and the king of M\u00e9 (dme) in Ngawa (rnga ba) were sworn brothers, the king of M\u00e9 (dme) sent his army to help, but it was too late. This conflict was resolved finally by the Guomindang officials in Lanzhou and Awa Aplo (a ba a blo) from Labrang (bla brang).<\/p><p>It seems that Tanglung Gorgen was not on friendly terms with Labrang. Gopo Trashi (mgo po bkra shis), the father of the fifth K\u00fcnkhyen (kun mkhyen), claimed control over Tanglung because Tanglung Monastery was under Labrang Monastery. But Tanglung Gorgen refuted the claim. Interestingly, Tanglong Gorgen enjoyed a close relationship with Ma Bufang and his officials.<\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><hr size=\"1\" \/><p><a href=\"#_ftnref1\">[1]<\/a> P\u00f6npo (dpon po) is a general Tibetan term and it means leader, but it is attached with official authority.<\/p><p><a href=\"#_ftnref2\">[2]<\/a> Gowa (mgo ba) is a general Tibetan term, which simply means leader (\u201cheadman\u201d).
