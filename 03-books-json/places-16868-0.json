The site overlooks the <span class=\"popular\">Maja Tsangpo<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Rma bya gtsang po<\/span> (Karnali river) valley to the south and east. A sheer drop of as much as 100 m begins near the site in both of these directions. To the north and west there is rolling country with some arable plots situated at about the same elevation as <span class=\"popular\">Guru Bumpa<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ru \u2019bum pa<\/span>. <span class=\"popular\">Guru Bumpa<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ru \u2019bum pa<\/span> consists of wo stepped platforms of seven graduated tiers each. These dry-mortar structures are aligned in the cardinal directions. They are built of stones (mostly of cobbles), 20 cm to 80 cm long, which have been tinted red with ochre. There are many old <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma \u1e47i<\/span> stones at <span class=\"popular\">Guru Bumpa<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ru \u2019bum pa<\/span>, as well as simply built <span class=\"popular emph\">Ch\u00f6rten<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mchod rten<\/span>,<span class=\"popular emph\">tenkhar<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\"> rten mkhar<\/span> and <span class=\"popular emph\">mani khorlo<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma \u1e47i \u2019khor lo<\/span> shrines.
