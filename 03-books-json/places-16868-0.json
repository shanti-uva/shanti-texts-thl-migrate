The site overlooks the <span class=\"popular\">Maja Tsangpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rma bya gtsang po</span> (Karnali river) valley to the south and east. A sheer drop of as much as 100 m begins\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnear the site in both of these directions. To the north and west there is rolling country with some arable plots\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsituated at about the same elevation as <span class=\"popular\">Guru Bumpa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ru &rsquo;bum pa</span>. <span class=\"popular\">Guru Bumpa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ru &rsquo;bum pa</span> consists of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttwo stepped platforms of seven graduated tiers each. These dry-mortar structures are aligned in the cardinal\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdirections. They are built of stones (mostly of cobbles), 20 cm to 80 cm long, which have been tinted red with\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tochre. There are many old <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma &#7751;i</span> stones at <span class=\"popular\">Guru Bumpa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ru &rsquo;bum pa</span>, as well as simply built <span class=\"popular emph\">Ch&ouml;rten</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mchod rten</span>,<span class=\"popular emph\">tenkhar</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trten mkhar</span> and <span class=\"popular emph\">mani khorlo</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma &#7751;i &rsquo;khor lo</span> shrines. On the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttop of each stepped <span class=\"popular emph\">bum pa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">&rsquo;bum pa</span> there is a prayer flag mast connected to one\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tanother by a line of prayer flags. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The twin structures of <span class=\"popular\">Guru Bumpa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ru &rsquo;bum pa</span> closely\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tresemble numerous rock art (both petroglyphs and pictographs) compositions depicting stepped shrines of the <span class=\"popular emph\">tenkhar</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rten mkhar</span>, <span class=\"popular emph\">lhaten</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">lha\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trten</span> and <span class=\"popular emph\">sekhar</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">gsas mkhar</span> classes. Much of this rock art\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcan be attributed to the early historic period, lending credence to the belief that <span class=\"popular\">Guru Bumpa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ru &rsquo;bum pa</span> was created in antiquity.<a href=\"#n90\" name=\"nb90\" class=\"note\">90</a> Nevertheless, the style of construction is rudimentary and easily amenable to modification, which may have\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tled to many instances of reconstruction and refurbishment over the centuries.
