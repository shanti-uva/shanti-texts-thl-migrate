The site overlooks the <span class=\"popular\">Maja Tsangpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rma bya gtsang po</span> (Karnali river) valley to the south and east. A sheer drop of as much as 100 m begins near the site in both of these directions. To the north and west there is rolling country with some arable plots situated at about the same elevation as <span class=\"popular\">Guru Bumpa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ru ’bum pa</span>. <span class=\"popular\">Guru Bumpa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ru ’bum pa</span> consists of wo stepped platforms of seven graduated tiers each. These dry-mortar structures are aligned in the cardinal directions. They are built of stones (mostly of cobbles), 20 cm to 80 cm long, which have been tinted red with ochre. There are many old <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma ṇi</span> stones at <span class=\"popular\">Guru Bumpa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ru ’bum pa</span>, as well as simply built <span class=\"popular emph\">Chörten</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mchod rten</span>,<span class=\"popular emph\">tenkhar</span><span class=\"scholar emph\"> rten mkhar</span> and <span class=\"popular emph\">mani khorlo</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma ṇi ’khor lo</span> shrines. On the op of each stepped <span class=\"popular emph\">bum pa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">’bum pa</span> there is a prayer flag mast connected to one another by a line of prayer flags. </p>
<p>The twin structures of <span class=\"popular\">Guru Bumpa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ru ’bum pa</span> closely resemble numerous rock art (both petroglyphs and pictographs) compositions depicting stepped shrines of the <span class=\"popular emph\">tenkhar</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rten mkhar</span>, <span class=\"popular emph\">lhaten</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">lha rten</span> and <span class=\"popular emph\">sekhar</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">gsas mkhar</span> classes. Much of this rock art can be attributed to the early historic period, lending credence to the belief that <span class=\"popular\">Guru Bumpa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ru ’bum pa</span> was created in antiquity.<a href=\"#n90\" name=\"nb90\" class=\"note\">90</a> Nevertheless, the style of construction is rudimentary and easily amenable to modification, which may have led to many instances of reconstruction and refurbishment over the centuries. It may also be worth considering the possibility that <span class=\"popular\">Guru Bumpa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ru ’bum pa</span>was originally founded as an archaic religious monument (as was much of the analogous rock art). We must bear in mind that gu rin po che occupation myths veil or reconfigure the pre-Buddhist origins of many sites in the Tibetan cultural world. Remarkably, <span class=\"popular\">Guru Bumpa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ru ’bum pa</span> survived the Chinese Cultural Revolution largely intact, although the site was desecrated. It is reported that stones with <span class=\"popular\">Guru Rinpoché</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ru rin po che</span>’s footprint (<span class=\"popular emph\">Zhabjé</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">zhabs rjes</span>), enshrined at the site, were destroyed at that time. </p>
