The top of the pillar narrows until it has a girth of only 50 cm. The southeast and northwest faces of <span class=\"popular\">Domilang<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo mi lang<\/span> are somewhat broader than its other two sides. The pillar is surrounded by five cairns topped with pieces of milky quartz and a couple of plaques inscribed with the <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma &#7751;i<\/span> mantra, a shrine that is no longer maintained. The heads of goats and sheep are tied to the top one-third of the pillar. This is an apotropaic cult practice to protect the remaining animals of the herd from sickness. Butter and red ochre have also been applied to the pillar, a sign of its sacred status and the healing power it is supposed to possess. There are hree faint markings on the southeast face of the pillar, which look a little like Tibetan letters. The faint vestiges of a wall running east-west (15 m long) begins 14 m south of the pillar. On both ends it connects with even more obscure walls running north-south. Although no coherent fragments have survived, it could be determined hat these walls are generally aligned in the cardinal directions. A dark-colored metamorphic rock (10 cm to 35 cm long) was used in the construction of these walls. They may possibly represent the remains of a separate funerary enclosure. <\/p> <hr class=\"footnote-divider\" \/> "},{"title":"Notes","index":7,"parent_index":0,"body":null}]}
