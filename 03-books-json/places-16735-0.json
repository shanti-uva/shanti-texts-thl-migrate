This she goat passed by the <span class=\"popular\">Domilang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo mi lang</span> valley and pillar, an important location,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbut it was determined not to have the qualities needed for the founding of a great Buddhist temple. This location\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twas incomplete, like a monk without his robes (<span class=\"popular emph\">ch&ouml;g&ouml;</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">chos gos</span>). The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlocation also fell under the influence of the inauspicious mountain, <span class=\"popular\">Nakgu</span><span class=\"scholar\">Nag gu</span> (Blackness), the residence of an evil spirit (<span class=\"popular\">dr&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">&rsquo;Dre</span>), rather than the auspicious<span class=\"popular\">Karru Lhatso</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dkar ru lha mtsho</span> (White Divine Lake) locale.

Finally, the nearby mountain, <span class=\"popular\">Langchung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Glang chung</span> (Lesser Elephant), lacked kidney fat. The she goat left her droppings at\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"popular\">Karru Lhatso</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dkar ru lha mtsho</span>, causing a scrub willow\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tforest to appear there. According to this well-developed legend, the <span class=\"popular\">Domilang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo mi lang</span> pillar was already erected by the early seventh century CE. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Site elements","index":6,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The four-sided blue-gray igneous pillar is slightly inclined to the northwest (1.85 m [height] x 1 m [basal\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgirth]). The top of the pillar narrows until it has a girth of only 50 cm. The southeast and northwest faces of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"popular\">Domilang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo mi lang</span> are somewhat broader than its\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tother two sides. The pillar is surrounded by five cairns topped with pieces of milky quartz and a couple of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tplaques inscribed with the <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma &#7751;i</span> mantra, a shrine that is no\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlonger maintained. The heads of goats and sheep are tied to the top one-third of the pillar. This is an apotropaic\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcult practice to protect the remaining animals of the herd from sickness. Butter and red ochre have also been\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tapplied to the pillar, a sign of its sacred status and the healing power it is supposed to possess. There are\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthree faint markings on the southeast face of the pillar, which look a little like Tibetan letters. The faint\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvestiges of a wall running east-west (15 m long) begins 14 m south of the pillar. On both ends it connects with\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\teven more obscure walls running north-south. Although no coherent fragments have survived, it could be determined\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat these walls are generally aligned in the cardinal directions. A dark-colored metamorphic rock (10 cm to 35 cm\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlong) was used in the construction of these walls. They may possibly represent the remains of a separate funerary\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tenclosure. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<hr class=\"footnote-divider\" />\n"},{"title":"Notes","index":7,"parent_index":0,"body":"\n<div class=\"footnote\">\n<a name=\"n42\" />\n<a href=\"#nb42\" class=\"note\">\n\t     \t\t\t\t[42] </a> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis tale about the magical she goat was collected from <span class=\"popular\">Lozang Tenpa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Blo bzang bstan pa</span> (born in Fire Tiger Year, circa 1926), a former chief\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trepresentative of the <span class=\"popular\">Namru</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gnam ru</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"popular emph\">dzongp&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rdzong dpon</span> (district head) under the old <span class=\"popular\">Lhasa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Lha sa</span> government and a member of the <span class=\"popular\">Nakchu</span><span class=\"scholar\">Nag chu</span> Political Consultative Committee under the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChinese Communists.
