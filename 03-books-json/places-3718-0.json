During the Ming dynasty of China it was\n                     incorporated into Sichuan province, and during the Manchu rule it was one of\n                     the Thirty-nine Tribes (Tsho ba so dgu).

Before the democratic reform was carried out, Bonpo monasteries\n                     were not allowed to tile their roofs and, they did not have anything like real\n                     estate, farmland, taxpayers or servants, but just a few livestock that could\n                     not even cover living expenses.

It was founded in 1847 by sPa ston gYung drung nam\n                        bzang, who was of the holy sPa lineage. The sPa is one of the six sacred\n                        families: Bru, Zhu, gShen, sPa, rMe&rsquo;u and Khyung. The Bon Sources and some\n                        other historical documents give reasons why the sPa family is important:</p>\n\n                     <p>lHa bu sPa ba spa thog, a son of Sangs po and Chu lcam, was born in heaven.\n                        He descended to earth from rTsa gsum lha and preached Bon.

At that time, in Zhang zhung, people used to say, &ldquo;In the\n                        sky the divine son is beautiful. On earth the king is great.&rdquo; Lha bu&rsquo;s\n                        descendants were ancestors of the sPa family and some of its members held\n                        the position of prelate at the court of kings of Tibet.</p>\n\n                     <p>sPa ston Khyung &rsquo;bar, who had obtained spiritual power of mysticism in the\n                        latter stage of Bon development, demonstrated his acquired abilities.

They proceeded from Amdo to the\n                        domain of the Hor Ye tha tribe and finally settled there.

After that, the centre of activities of the\n                        sPa family was shifted from west to east. All Bonpo sources agree that the\n                        monastery in Hor Ye tha constituted the most important monastic centre of\n                        the sPa lineage.</p>\n\n                     <p>Later, sPa ston gYung drung bstan pa &rsquo;brug grags had other assembly halls\n                        built, with passages around them, on the three storeys of a building that\n                        had one hundred pillars. He also had the following religious objects\n                        erected: a stupa of bDud &rsquo;dul sgra sgrags, and statues of sTon pa rdzogs sku\n                        and rNam par rgyal ba, all gilt-bronze works.

Concerning Sog gYung drung gling Monastery, the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">sKal bzang mgrin rgyan</span>, a<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"> </span>Bonpo\n                        work, describes it as follows:</p>\n\n                     <p>&ldquo;It is not certain when this monastery was founded, but it certainly existed\n                        in the Third Rab byung (1147-1206). There were four monastic colleges and\n                        more than two thousand monks. It is said that the establishment was so big\n                        that horn-calls for assemblies had to be blown in the four directions.</p>\n\n                     <p>After the destruction of Sog gYung drung gling by the barbarous Mongolian\n                        Jungar, the Mongol hordes plundered several important religious objects,\n                        which they carried away and gave to Sog Tsan dan dgon, an important dGe lugs\n                        pa monastery situated in the same region.</p>\n\n                     <p>The belongings of lamas of Khyung and dBu, who were members of thirteen\n                        individual establishments in Sog gYung drung gling, and some irreplaceable\n                        sacred objects, including the golden statue of sTag la me &rsquo;bar and the skull\n                        of dBu ri lama, were given to Lung dkar Monastery. This was why Lung dkar\n                        Monastery considered Sog gYung drung gling to be its predecessor.</p>\n\n                     <p>Lung dkar Monastery&rsquo;s history can be presented in three parts. First, in\n                        1715, Chos &rsquo;bum, chief of the Hor Ye tha tribe, and his son Mu khri rgyal ba\n                        tshul khrims, who was a lama, founded the hermitage called Ri khrod dkar po\n                        in Lung bzang. The objective of this was to perform religious services for\n                        the lama and peace in the region. In that year bsKal bzang rgya mtsho, the\n                        Seventh Dalai Lama, passed through the Hor area from mGar thar in Khams on\n                        horseback. Chos &rsquo;bum successfully solicited him to issue a decree officially\n                        recognizing the hermitage. But after the death of Mu khri rgyal ba tshul\n                        khrims, the hermitage collapsed due to internal discord.</p>\n\n                     <p>Second, Ye tha Nor bu tshe rgyal, the scholar bSod nams lhun grub of dBu ri\n                        house and dBra Khyung rGyal ba bstan &rsquo;dzin founded gYu lung Monastery in\n                        1808 at the same place. The king of Hor, Tshe ring rab brtan, issued a\n                        proclamation, with a preamble by rTa tshag Ho thog thu of Kun bde gling in\n                        Lhasa, that this monastery, which was an establishment for the leaders of\n                        the Ye tha community, should be lead by the lamas of sPo la and dBu ri. It\n                        actually became a real monastery from the time of dBu bla rGyal ba tshul\n                        khrims, the reincarnation of Mu khri, and it was called gYu lung. However,\n                        in 1868 it was destroyed by an avalanche of snow. </p>\n\n                     <p>Third, rNam rgyal dbang &rsquo;dus, the king of Hor, then gave orders that the\n                        monastery should be restored at once, for it was an extremely bad omen that\n                        the monastery was destroyed by an avalanche and he gave twenty <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">&rsquo;bri</span> (young female yaks), along with a measure of\n                        Chinese silver, as a contribution to the restoration of the monastery. In\n                        1925, on the 22nd day of the 9th month, dBra khyung sKal bzang dbang grags\n                        and dBu ri bsTan &rsquo;dzin dbang rgyal - supported by the local people and in\n                        accordance with a prophecy by gYung drung dbang rgyal, the Twentieth abbot\n                        of sMan ri - began to restore the monastery. On this occasion, important\n                        prelates of the Bon religion, such as Nyag gter gSang sngags gling pa, his\n                        wife mKha&rsquo; &rsquo;gro bDe chen dbang mo and Me ston Kun dga&rsquo; rgyal mtshan all came\n                        and the monks of the monastery, joined by the local people, welcomed them\n                        with a procession.</p>\n\n                     <p>On the same occasion, at the holy mountain called gSang brag nor bu lha rtse\n                        situated behind the monastery, the secret abode of the three wrathful\n                        deities blessed by the three holy ones, a profound text was rediscovered by\n                        gSang sngags gling pa and he, after tracing the path of circumambulation of\n                        the mountain, wrote a guide to it. There was a performance of the debate\n                        between gods and demons, in which the gods won and their sons went up to\n                        occupy the upper part of the Lung dkar valley and those of demons defeated\n                        went down to the lower part of the valley.</p>\n\n                     <p>Around the holy mountain there are other mountains such as gYu lung, Lung\n                        dkar and dByi dkar with all their spirit proprietors. The proprietor of\n                        Mount dByi dkar is a white Tibetan lynx as the name indicates. There is a\n                        &ldquo;soul-lake&rdquo; (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">bla mtsho</span>) called Ma ma mtsho, which is\n                        said to be the source of the lake of Ma pang gYu mtsho. There are footprints\n                        of gShen rab Mi bo and mKha&rsquo; &rsquo;gro bDe chen dbang mo, and the treasure cave\n                        of gSang sngags gling pa as well as the meditation caves of the eighty\n                        adepts. There is also the head-print in the rock of dBu ri bSod nams rgyal\n                        mtshan.</p>\n\n                     <p>The principal religious objects of this monastery were as follows: the\n                        bronze statue of gShen rab Mi bo that remained unburned when Sog gYung drung\n                        gling Monastery was destroyed; a five-finger-breadth-high bronze statue of\n                        gNam phyi gung rgyal; a statue of Kun dga&rsquo; rgyal mtshan that had not been\n                        caught in the fire; an icon of gShen lha &rsquo;od dkar drawn on cotton; the skull\n                        of the dBu ri bsTan &rsquo;dzin phun tshogs, which contains his skylark-egg-size\n                        relic; a ghost-exorcising knotted knife used by dBu ri sKar ma rgyal mtshan;\n                        a small white conch derived from a Khyung Zla sras can and a self-grown\n                        letter A. Similarly, there were a great many scriptures, including a\n                        complete set of <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">bKa&rsquo; &rsquo;gyur</span> and <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">bKa&rsquo;</span>\n                        <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">brten</span>.</p>\n\n                     <p>There were four important lamas in this monastery: dBu rGyal ba tshul\n                        khrims, sPo bSod nams g-yung drung, sGang ru bsTan pa kun khyab and dBu\n                        Tshul khrims rgyal mtshan. From among these, I shall give a brief account of\n                        rGyal ba tshul khrims and Tshul khrims rgyal mtshan:</p>\n\n                     <p>dBu rGyal ba tshul khrims was born in 1864 to the father Rin chen phun\n                        tshogs and the mother dMar rtsa bza&rsquo;, as their second son among four &ndash; the\n                        eldest bSod nams gYung drung, the second himself, the third sKar ma rgyal\n                        mtshan and the youngest bsTan &rsquo;dzin phun tshogs. From childhood, he had an\n                        intellectual power incomparable with any other children. gSang sngags gling\n                        pa mentioned his name in his book on a prophetic lineage entitled the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">sKyes phreng gsol &rsquo;debs</span> as follows:</p>\n\n                     <p>&ldquo;The emanation who converts the sentient beings may come having the\n                        following names:</p>\n\n                     <p>Yongs su dag pa, the gShen of the gods, in heaven;</p>\n\n                     <p>Dam pa rgya gar, the great saint;</p>\n\n                     <p>U ri bsod nams rgyal mtshan, the incomparable;</p>\n\n                     <p>Shes rab seng ge, in the land of rGyal rong;</p>\n\n                     <p>Ban rde Rin chen, in the valley of Kong po;</p>\n\n                     <p>bSod nams ye shes, in gTsang;</p>\n\n                     <p>rGyal ba tshul khrims, in the land of Gyi ghir.</p>\n\n                     <p>To this lineage of rosary of pearl I pray.&rdquo;</p>\n\n                     <p>dBu rGyal ba tshul khrims was exceedingly intelligent when he was young. He\n                        could grasp, when he was just showing how to write, read and recite, which\n                        brought him public praise. When a deep compassion for the cyclic existence\n                        arose in his heart, he became absorbed in meditation in hermitages and\n                        accomplished his self-training. In the presence of sPa ston Nyi ma &rsquo;bum\n                        gsal, Nyag gter gSang sngags gling pa and Grub dbang sMon lam rgyal mtshan\n                        he took initiations and received the very essence of the ocean of precepts.\n                        He excelled in all learning. Not only that, he showed signs of unparalleled\n                        spiritual accomplishment. His name, rGyal ba tshul khrims, became widely\n                        known all over the district, like an ensign fluttering. He was only seven\n                        when he took over responsibility as the head of Lung dkar Monastery, and\n                        passed away at the age of ninety-six.</p>\n\n                     <p>As for dBu Tshul khrims rgyal mtshan, he was born in 1924 as the eldest of\n                        four sons of the father sKal bzang bstan &rsquo;dzin and the mother Zo bza&rsquo; dgyes\n                        skyid. When he was six he began writing and reading, and before long he\n                        attained the highest perfection. He took ordination to enter the priesthood\n                        in the presence of dBu rGyal ba tshul khrims and received the name Tshul\n                        khrims rgyal mtshan. He received complete instruction in the rediscovered\n                        holy texts in the presence of Tri bo bSod nams rgyal mtshan, and learned\n                        metaphysics mainly from Khyung slob Tshul khrims rgyal mtshan. He spent six\n                        years learning such subjects as grammar, phonetics, poetics, <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">dkar rtsis </span>and <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">nag rtsis</span>, chanting and\n                        mandala-painting. As he also studied Sutra, Tantra and Mind, he became a\n                        veritable scholar.</p>\n\n                     <p>In the presence of rGyal ba tshul khrims, Khyung po bZod ba rgyal mtshan,\n                        sPa ston &rsquo;Brug Rinpoche and Khyung slob Tshul khrims rgyal mtshan, he asked\n                        for numerous initiations and instructions on texts. In the presence of the\n                        rGyal tshab Blo gros rgya mtsho he took a complete course of initiations and\n                        transmissions of texts by Grub dbang Shar rdza, and took the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">dge tshul</span> vows of monk. He worked hard for Lung dkar Monastery to\n                        develop its study and practice and made sure that it followed the Bru\n                        tradition. In 1984 he passed away.

Thereafter, for a long period there was neither a communal\n                        leader nor a lama.

He was\n                        himself a native of sGang ru. He had a great reputation as an accomplished\n                        scholar. After leaving his duty in gYung drung gling he devoted himself to\n                        meditation for eight years on the island of the lake Gyer ru mtsho.

The monks\n                        and laymen of the sGang ru Byang ma district held repeated discussions and\n                        sent bsTan pa lhun grub as a delegate to invite Tshul khrims rgyal mtshan,\n                        who, however, refused to accept the invitation.

He\n                        looked for a good site and in 1957 he founded sGra rgyal Monastery in front\n                        of Mount Gung sman yul sa. This mountain had the look of a white conch and\n                        is situated at the back of the monastery.</p>\n\n                     <p>The monastery closely followed, in all its ceremonies, the tradition of\n                        gYung drung gling.

The temple and assembly hall had their religious objects\n                        and were fully equipped.

That is why the monastery is called Klu phug.</p>\n\n                     <p>There was a Tantric establishment called mKhar dmar bla brang founded in\n                        1626 by Khri rgyal rje chen, the twelfth king of the Thirty-nine Tribes of\n                        Hor. He was a tantric practitioner and followed both Bon and &rsquo;Bri gung bKa&rsquo;\n                        rgyud pa traditions. </p>\n\n                     <p>mKhar dmar was situated at a saddle-shaped craggy red hill called Gung lhag.\n                        It was a two-storey building. On the top of the roof it had various emblems\n                        unique to the ancient Bon tradition, such as the perch of birds. In the\n                        centre and at the four corners of the roof there were spears erected and\n                        decorated with yak&rsquo;s hair on their tips, surrounded by deer and wild yak\n                        horns. In the assembly hall on the upper floor there were four pillars and\n                        it was the place where twelve Tantric practitioners gathered together. There\n                        were the following religious objects: clay images of the four-armed sPyan\n                        ras gzigs, sGrol dkar, rNam par rgyal ba and Khri gtsug rgyal ba;\n                        scriptures, including the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">Khams chen</span> in sixteen\n                           volumes<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"> </span>and the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">bDal &rsquo;bum</span> in\n                        twelve volumes; eight stupas made of a mixture of medicine and clay, each of\n                        which was as tall as an arrow. On the west side of the floor there was a\n                        single-pillared meditation room in which Khri rgyal rje chen erected\n                        gilt-bronze statues of Kun bzang rgyal ba &rsquo;dus pa and dBal gsas rngam pa\n                        (this statue still exists) less than a cubit in height. These had been\n                        concealed in the ground at Sham po during the suppression of Bon in Central\n                        Tibet and was rediscovered by rMa ston lHa rgod Shes rab seng ge. Moreover,\n                        there were images of Dran pa nam mkha&rsquo; with his twin sons made of the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">li</span> from Zhang zhung, a span in height (two of these\n                        statues still exist). These were rediscovered in Phyug mo dpal ri by Bon\n                        zhig gYung drung gling pa.</p>\n\n                     <p>In 1786, lHa mkhar bstan rgyal, the elder son of Khri rgyal rje chen, was\n                        enthroned and maintained the mKhar dmar establishment as his father did. He\n                        married gShen bza&rsquo; dPal &rsquo;dzin, a lady of the gShen family. He abandoned his\n                        family&rsquo;s tradition to follow &rsquo;Bri gung bka&rsquo; brgyud and was content to keep\n                        only the Bon tradition. Dpal &rsquo;dzin, the queen, became a nun in her later\n                        life and lived in a cave to devote herself to meditation. Her cave can still\n                        be visited.</p>\n\n                     <p>Tshe ring rab brtan, the son of lHa mkhar, succeeded his father. However, he\n                        was more concerned with politics. He had two tent residences. One of these\n                        two was in sBra chen and it was in this that he used live and it became the\n                        seat of his government.</p>\n\n                     <p>In mKhar dmar, there was lHa bla bsTan pa phun tshogs, who is said to be a\n                        native of rGyal rong. He looked after the tantric establishment (which\n                        usually had twelve tantrists). lHun grub &rsquo;od zer (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">alias</span>\n                        Shang blang Drang srong) of rTing ngu Monastery came to join him and he was\n                        ordained by bsTan pa phun tshogs. So mKhar dmar started having monks in its\n                        midst. lHa bla also established there the ritual practice of the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">Zhi khro dgongs &rsquo;dus</span> according to the New Bon tradition.\n                        This was to be performed in the eighth month every year.</p>\n\n                     <p>Here is an account of how Klu phug Monastery was founded. In 1827 Nyi ma\n                        bstan &rsquo;dzin, the twenty-third abbot of sMan ri Monastery (No.1), travelled\n                        to the region of Hor. He came and stayed in Klu phug Monastery. There he\n                        presided over the ceremony of the enthronement of bsTan &rsquo;dzin dbang grags,\n                        the reincarnation of lHa bla bsTan pa phun tshogs, at mKhar dmar bla brang.\n                        On the same occasion, he encouraged bsTan &rsquo;dzin dbang grags and the twelve\n                        tantrists to take monastic ordination. Klu phug then with its mKhar dmar bla\n                        brang became a real monastery and the abbot gave it the name gShen bstan\n                        gYung drung bde chen gling and wrote a monastic code for it entitled the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">Thar lam them skas</span>, setting out regulations in\n                        accordance with the Bonpo monastic tradition. Not only that, he issued an\n                        edict establishing the monastery as being the first branch of sMan ri in the\n                        region. He entrusted the monastic management to Ma bdud btsan rgyal bzhi,\n                        the Bonpo protectors, and bestowed upon the monastery a large flat bell\n                        discovered in rGyal rong Brag steng and it has been one of the principal\n                        religious objects of this monastery up to the present day.</p>\n\n                     <p>bsTan &rsquo;dzin dbang grags maintained the time-honoured custom of mKhar dmar\n                        bla brang, except that the twelve tantrists were now all monks. He added an\n                        eight-pillared assembly hall and established the commemoration of sTon pa\n                        gShen rab&rsquo;s birthday on the 15th day of the first Tibetan month, and the\n                        performance of the ritual Ma tri bum sgrub on the 15th day of the eighth\n                        month.</p>\n\n                     <p>Later, bsTan pa dar rgyas, a prince of the royal house of Hor, became the\n                        head of the monastery. In his childhood, he was recognized as the\n                        reincarnation of a high lama in rGyal rong. So a number of gifts, including\n                        a copy of the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">Khams chen</span>, written in gold, were\n                        presented to Khri dbang rab brtan, the sixteenth king of Hor, in the hope\n                        that he would permit the child to leave for rGyal rong. However, the king\n                        was powerful enough to hold back the child (his own son) from leaving and\n                        returned the gifts. So bsTan pa dar rgyas eventually decided himself to\n                        become a monk and later ascended the throne of Klu phug Monastery. In\n                        addition to the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">dgu gtor</span> rite, formerly performed by\n                        the Twelve Tantrists, he established a new custom of a complete ritual\n                        practice of the Red Yamantaka (gShin rje gshed dmar). Following this,\n                        religious dances were performed, to which he added new dances: sNang bgyad,\n                        Tshogs &rsquo;cham, and the Yamantaka.</p>\n\n                     <p>rNam rgyal dbang &rsquo;dus, a brother of bsTan pa dar rgyas, entered the\n                        priesthood and succeeded his brother in the monastery, but the seventeenth\n                        king of Hor, Nor bu dbang rgyal, died prematurely, so he had to leave the\n                        monk body and succeed to the throne. As a confession (of having broken the\n                        monastic vows) a two-storey temple with six pillars was build in the\n                        monastery. There were gilt-bronze statues of rNam par rgyal ba and the Four\n                        Principal Buddhas, a span in height. Families of the &rsquo;Brog shog and Bon tha\n                        tribes of the Thirty-seven Tribes of Hor took an oath that they would send\n                        their second son (if there was one) to become a monk. From that point the\n                        monastery began to have many monks.</p>\n\n                     <p>bsTan pa rgyal mtshan, of the royal house of Hor, ascended the monastic\n                        throne. From childhood he was faithful, industrious and intelligent, so that\n                        he became the focus of praise from all the people. He took monastic vows at\n                        the age of thirteen. After that, according to custom, he made offerings to\n                        the three monasteries, including sMan ri. In the presence of sKal bzang nyi\n                        ma, the second abbot of gYung drung gling, he took full ordination. He then\n                        set out on pilgrimage to Mount Ti se and the soul-mountain of Bon in Zhang\n                        zhung and also the lake Ma pang g-yu mtsho. There he made circumambulations\n                        and prostrations.</p>\n\n                     <p>He then returned to his monastery where he had various stupas built,\n                        including a reliquary stupa of a gShen lama in the form of gYung drung bkod\n                        legs and another reliquary stupa of bsTan pa dar rgyas in the form of rNam\n                        rgyal mchod rten made of silver, the height of a person and adorned with\n                        varieties of vivid gems. He had a temple built to house the stupas he had\n                        had made. His main spiritual masters were gTer ston Nam mkha&rsquo; khri khyung of\n                        Zhu and Grub dbang sMon lam rgyal mtshan of Khyung po. gTer ston gYung drung\n                        grags pa of Zhu, who was the prelate of the king Tshe ring rab brtan, made\n                        Mount Brag dkar lha lung, where the monastery is situated, into a sacred\n                        site and established a new custom of circumambulating the sacred hill in the\n                        region.</p>\n\n                     <p>bsTan pa rgyal tshan made copies, by himself, of the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">bKa&rsquo;\n                           &rsquo;gyur</span> and <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">bKa&rsquo;</span>\n                        <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">brten </span> in vermilion ink and had a temple with eight\n                        pillars built to house them. This temple also contained a gilt-bronze statue\n                        of sTon pa gShen rab and a reliquary stupa of Zhu Nam mkha&rsquo; khri khyung the\n                        height of an arrow. An assembly hall was also built, with two storeys and\n                        six long pillars and sixty-six short ones. In the inner sanctuary there was\n                        a complete set of lTung bshags lha &rsquo;khor of gilt-bronze. On the right wall\n                        were murals of the Bya rgyud and sPyod rgyud deities. On the left wall were\n                        the principal deities of the Ye shes and Ye she chen po&rsquo;i rgyud. On the\n                        walls around the upper structure were the Four Principal Buddhas and the\n                        masters who maintained the monastic tradition. On both sides of the door\n                        were Bonpo religious protectors, both male and female. In the front hall\n                        were murals of the eight dPal mgon chen po brgyad, the Four Great Kings and\n                        the local deity lHa dbang dgra &rsquo;dul.</p>\n\n                     <p>This monastery followed the Bru tradition in its activities as exactly as\n                        that of sMan ri Monastery: in the eighth month, the ritual of Khro bo, and\n                        in the third month that of Phur pa, finishing with a whole day&rsquo;s dance\n                        performance.</p>\n\n                     <p>In 1912 the Thirty-nine Tribes of Hor came under the control of the Manchu\n                        officials resident in Tibet and then, later, the Tibetan government began to\n                        rule over the tribes. This Tibetan (dGe lugs pa) rule over the region soon\n                        had an adverse effect on the Bonpo monasteries.</p>\n\n                     <p>Then Sangs rgyas bstan &rsquo;dzin, a Hor lama, took care of the mKhar dmar Bla\n                        brang residence. sGo ston Nyi ma rgyal mtshan succeeded him. The latter was\n                        born in 1937 at lHa thog in sDe dge, in a family of the sKam lineage. He\n                        later became the head of Klu phug Monastery. He reorganized the cemetery in\n                        the vicinity of the monastery by subduing the ground and building a stone\n                        mandala there. The place was the abode of mKha&rsquo; &rsquo;gro Seng gdong ma and the\n                        ground looks like the crooked knife of a <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">mkha&rsquo; &rsquo;gro ma</span>\n                        and the bare hills nearby resemble a woman&rsquo;s breasts.</p>\n\n                     <p>mKhan chung Grags rnam, the first Hor governor, assigned by the Tibetan\n                        government, appointed the head of Klu phug Monastery as the abbot of\n                        thirty-eight monasteries among the Thirty-nine Tribes by issuing an edict\n                        and a seal.

From Khyung nag Klu rgyal a line continued\n                        as follows: Mu la ti ro, Khod rtsal hur min, Zla ri a kag, Gu ra ta kra,\n                        lHun grub &rsquo;phrin las, (who is said to be the founder of gZu bon Monastery),\n                        and Mu ri ha ra, whose two sons were dPon dge and dPon &rsquo;ud. It was these two\n                        brothers who were the leaders of Sog gYung drung gling Monastery when the\n                        Mongolian troops of Jungar began to attack their monastery and destroy\n                        it.</p>\n\n                     <p>After that, Drung mu tshul ming of Khyung came to sPu la kha by way of dKar\n                        shod. He stopped there for the night. During the night he was shot and\n                        killed by accident when there was an archery contest organized by the local\n                        chief, gZu pa. This news reached Khyung nag Sa trig, who took the case to\n                        court and obtained the sPu la kha land as compensation for the killing.\n                        Khyung nag Sa trig then became known as sPu la Lama.</p>\n\n                     <p>Shes rab rgyal mtshan of Khyung nag then founded sPu la Monastery. It was\n                        destroyed by the Jungar troops, but restored by Khyung A bla. The latter&rsquo;s\n                        son, dBang rgyal lhun grub, is said to have rediscovered a statue of sTon pa\n                        gShen rab on the island in the lake gNam tsho. It is still preserved in the\n                        monastery. dBang rgyal lhun grub&rsquo;s son was A ti mu wer. The latter&rsquo;s son was\n                        Ge khod dBang rgyal, who was regarded as a manifestation of the deity A ti\n                        mu wer and is said to have rediscovered a statue of rNam par rgyal ba, which\n                        is also kept in the monastery. Ge khod dBang rgyal had a son called Khyung A\n                        dar. From him the line continued through Bla sgur, gYung drung tshe mchog,\n                        dBang dbang and gYang &rsquo;job. In the monastery there was also the dagger\n                        called gNam lcags phur pa, rediscovered by Khyung Rin chen dbang rgyal, and\n                        relics of various sizes produced from the cremation when he died.</p>\n\n                     <p>When the abbot of sMan ri, Nyi ma bstan &rsquo;dzin, came to sPu la Monastery, he\n                        bestowed upon it the name dPal gShen bstan gYung drung gling. Following\n                        that, there were masters such as Khyung nag bSod nams g-yung drung and bSod\n                        nams chos rgyal at the monastery. There were about sixty-five tantric\n                        practitioners strictly observing the tantric vows.</p>\n\n                     <p>The main religious objects, in addition to those mentioned above, were as\n                        follows: three excellent statues of Byams ma; those of Nang chen grags pa\n                        and sTag la, a cubit in height; a small one of Dran pa nam mkha&rsquo;; rGyal ba\n                        rgya mtsho, a cubit in height; two excellent ones of sTon pa gShen rab; and\n                        a multi-coloured statue of Kun tu bzang po. All were made of copper. Besides\n                        these, there was a thangka of the Twelve Deeds and a large thangka made of\n                        the silk of mNyam med Shes rab rgyal mtshan. As for scriptures, there was\n                        the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">Khams chen</span> in four volumes, written in gold, called\n                        &rsquo;Dzam gling rgyan gcig (\"the only gem of the world\"). There were also the\n                        following objects: a black stone with a self-risen letter A formed of\n                        tricoloured onyx on it; bone relics the size of a goose egg; four knotted\n                        knives made when the spirits sPyang &rsquo;gag were subdued; eight reliquary\n                        stupas made of gold, silver and copper; eight cubit-height stupas made of\n                        sandalwood and juniper; a maroon coloured conch; a dragon flint; a\n                        horse-whip made of native onyx; a sacred gold horse-saddle; a serpent made\n                        of turquoise; a cannibal demon&rsquo;s right hand made of coral; a maroon coloured\n                        precious stone; and a pair of oboes made of gold. This monastery had this\n                        manifold wealth of religious objects and innumerable treasures.</p>\n\n                     <p>The range of holy mountains behind the monastery includes gYung drung dpung\n                        rdzong, sTag la me &rsquo;bar, A rngul &rsquo;bri ri phyung mo and Pha bong bon ri. It\n                        is said that if one performs circumambulation around Mount Pha bong bon ri\n                        it is equal to doing that once around Kong po bon ri. There are footprints\n                        of sTon pa gShen rab and the four scholarly men. Near the lake mTsho chen ma\n                        there is the footprint of Srid pa rgyal mo drel dmar.</p>\n\n                     <p>The monastery closely follows the sMan ri tradition. The monks assemble\n                        sixty times a year amounting to seventy-nine days. There are fifty monks,\n                        including the abbot gYung drung rgyal mtshan, sKal bzang dbang grags, who\n                        oversees the observation of the fasting ceremony, Rin chen blo gros, the\n                        disciplinarian, and bsTan pa tshul khrims, the chanting conductor.

It is also\n                        known as Nang mdun dgon. sPu rgyal is a holy mountain for both Bonpo and\n                        Buddhists. Its being a holy site was prophesied by early sages and this is\n                        particularly clear in the guide written by gTer ston bDe chen gling pa. rMa\n                        rong Monastery was later enlarged by Drung mu, who had overcome many\n                        obstacles brought on by the local deities.

Intending to migrate to Western Tibet, they arrived at the\n                        residence of the rMa rong local chief. A rgya, the chief of rMa rong, was a\n                        patron of Kun bzang grags pa. A rgya and his people requested Kun bzang\n                        grags pa to be the head of rMa rong Monastery. However, Kun bzang grags pa\n                        and his brother declined the offer. They continued their journey. A rgya\n                        then informed Khri rgyal rje chen, the twelfth king of Hor. The king told\n                        Kun bzang grags pa that not only could he not leave for Western Tibet, he\n                        should settle down in the pastureland where the king had his herd of <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">mdzo</span> animals, as well as look after rMa rong Monastery.\n                        From that point the monastery had to perform religious services for the\n                        benefit of the king and, in return, the king issued an edict in recognition\n                        of the monastery.</p>\n\n                     <p>Khyung po gYung drung rnam dag, the son of Khyung po Kun bzang grags pa, had\n                        a temple called rNam rgyal lha khang built in the monastery, containing many\n                        religious objects. He made majestic masks of the religious protectors such\n                        as the Ma (Srid pa rgyal mo), the bDud (Mi bdu &rsquo;byams pa khrag mgo) and the\n                        bTsan (Brag btsan A bse rgyal ba).

When Khyung po g-yung dpal died, it is\n                        said that where his corpse was buried the tree <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">stag ma</span>\n                        grew from his tongue. His son was gYung drung phun tshogs, whose sons were\n                        Blo ldan grags pa and Tshe dbang grags pa. Tshe dbang grags pa brought\n                        considerable development to the monastery. After that, Blo ldan grags pa was\n                        involved in a dispute with bSod nams bkra shis, the brother of the rMa rong\n                        chief, so Blo ldan grags pa strongly wished to leave for Western Tibet, but\n                        was prevented by the king of Hor. The king told him that unless he would\n                        live in rMa rong he would have to live in either Khrom tshang or sGong ru.\n                        So Blo ldan grags pa stayed in Khrom tshang for several years, during which\n                        rMa rong Monastery declined a little. After that, bSod nams dbang &rsquo;dus, the\n                        son of the rMa rong chief, requested the lama to come back to the monastery,\n                        but the lama was unwilling. Through the mediation of a representative of the\n                        king and the Be hu of the Sog tribe, the lama was reinstalled as the head of\n                        the monastery. He undertook as much restoration as he could. He lived to one\n                        hundred years of age. His son is Khyung po Bla rgan gYung dga&rsquo;, who is\n                        presently at the monastery. There were nine lamas in the line of succession,\n                        from Kun bzang grags pa to Blo ldan grags pa.

After that, the lamas of the Khrom family lived in\n                        tents made of the yak hair or in hermitages.</p>\n\n                     <p>After a long period of misfortune, Shes rab g-yung drung, the Twenty-fifth\n                        abbot of sMan ri Monastery (No.1), paid a visit to the region. He instructed\n                        the Khrom family to rebuild the monastery and restore its tradition.

It was called gYung drung\n                        kun grags gling. The head of the monastery was dGe bzang gYung drung dbang\n                        rgyal. A series of six heads of the monastery followed him, down to Yon tan\n                        rgya mtsho.
