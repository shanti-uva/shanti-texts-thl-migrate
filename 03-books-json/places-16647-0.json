There are no\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstructural traces of an enclosure in the proximity of the pillars. However, the way in which the pillars form a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnorth-south oriented row (6.2 m long), with three more specimens running perpendicular to the north of them, may\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsuggest that they were originally enclosed by walls. The sandy, somewhat sloping ground appears to have engulfed\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tall evidence of the enclosure. Two types of light-colored rocks were used to create the pillars. A few of them may\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thave been roughly hewn into shape. There are six pillars 50 cm to 80 cm in height and about eight others 30 cm or\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tless in height. Most of the pillars have been broken. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>In this region (upper <span class=\"popular\">Yarlung Tsangpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Yar lung gtsang po</span> drainage basin), sites such as sa sna dmar rdo ring are generally thought\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto have been built by the ancient <span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span> or to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbe the sanctuaries of elemental spirits. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Affiliated sites","index":6,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>West of sa sna dmar rdo ring is <span class=\"popular\">Gach&ouml; G&ouml;npa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dga&rsquo; chos dgon pa</span>, a <span class=\"popular emph\">gelukpa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">dge lugs\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpa</span> monastery of significant size, which was destroyed during the Chinese Cultural Revolution.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n"}]}
