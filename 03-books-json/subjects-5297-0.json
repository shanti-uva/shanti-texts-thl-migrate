   "body": "<p class=\"Paragraph\">In Literary Tibetan we sometimes find nominal sentences, that is, sentences with no verb (and no adjective with a verb function). These sentences usually end in a noun, but they may also end in some formulation other than a verb (such as a pronoun or an adverb). In most cases, these nominal sentences end in the concluding particle <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">འོ་</span> or one of its variants (xxlink Table: Variant Written forms of Grammatical Cases and Morphemes).</p>
<ul> <li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">བླ་མ་རྣམས་ཀྱིས་སོ།</span> “(It was) by the lamas.”</li> <li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">སྐྱོ་སྐྱོ་སེམས་པ་སྐྱོའོ།</span> “Sad, sad, my heart (is so) sad.”</li> <li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">འདི་ནི་སྡུག་བསྔལ་ལོ།</span> “This (is) suffering.”</li> </ul>
