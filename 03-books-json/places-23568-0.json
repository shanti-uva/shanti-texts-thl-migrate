Later, during Khri\n                        srong lde btsan&rsquo;s persecution of Bon, sNya chen Bla ma, a Bonpo master and a\n                        descendant of sNya chen Li shu stag ring, another great Bonpo master, also\n                        escaped to Khams and took refuge in &rsquo;Dra where he rebuilt the hermitage\n                        which later became the first Bonpo monastic establishment in the area.\n                        According to the same legend, he brought a cypress branch from Mount Kongpo\n                        Bon ri and planted it in &rsquo;Dra valley where it grew into a tree which exists\n                        to this day. There is a village called sNya gad<a href=\"#n37\" name=\"nb37\" class=\"note\">37</a> in the valley which is said to have preserved numerous ancient texts\n                        inherited from their ancestors, but unfortunately they were all destroyed\n                        during the Cultural Revolution. Shortly after, Byang Nyi ma rgyal mtshan, a\n                        descendant of Khro tshang in rDza khog brought to the monastery a statue\n                        representing gShen rab Mi bo as a three-year old boy from Central Tibet. He\n                        also enlarged the monastery. His residence (of which only the ruins remain\n                        today) was called Pho nyi bla brang. Later, a master called gTsug phud moved\n                        the monastery to its present site<a href=\"#n38\" name=\"nb38\" class=\"note\">38</a> and renamed it Chu mig. According to the same legend, he was a\n                        descendant of the sPa tshang family based in Yu ring village, Central Tibet. </p>\n\n                     <p>Later, Khod po Blo gros thogs med (1280-1337) arrived in &rsquo;Dra valley and\n                        unveiled the sacred mountain (gnas ri) of &rsquo;Dra gnas the&rsquo;u bo. Among his\n                        foremost disciples there were the Seven Great Lamas. One of the seven was a\n                        master from sNya gad village situated near Chu mig Monastery.</p>\n\n                     <p>dGe bshes gYung drung bstan &rsquo;dzin, the founder of Brag ra Monastery, took\n                        Chu mig Monastery under his wing, and thus the two monasteries developed\n                        close ties during his lifetime. Hor ra bDud &rsquo;dul also came to &rsquo;Dra valley\n                        and founded Seng ge Monastery. This was the first Buddhist monastery in the\n                        area.
