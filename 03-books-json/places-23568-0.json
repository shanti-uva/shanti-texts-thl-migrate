History","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":" <p>According to legend, during Gri gum btsan po&rsquo;s time, because of the persecution of Bon in Central Tibet, Me nyag lCe tsha mkhar bu, a famous Bonpo master, escaped to Khams and established a hermitage in &rsquo;Dra valley which became the first Bonpo establishment in the area. Later, during Khri srong lde btsan&rsquo;s persecution of Bon, sNya chen Bla ma, a Bonpo master and a descendant of sNya chen Li shu stag ring, another great Bonpo master, also escaped to Khams and took refuge in &rsquo;Dra where he rebuilt the hermitage which later became the first Bonpo monastic establishment in the area. According to the same legend, he brought a cypress branch from Mount Kongpo Bon ri and planted it in &rsquo;Dra valley where it grew into a tree which exists to this day. There is a village called sNya gad<a href=\"#n37\" name=\"nb37\" class=\"note\">37<\/a> in the valley which is said to have preserved numerous ancient texts inherited from their ancestors, but unfortunately they were all destroyed during the Cultural Revolution. Shortly after, Byang Nyi ma rgyal mtshan, a descendant of Khro tshang in rDza khog brought to the monastery a statue representing gShen rab Mi bo as a three-year old boy from Central Tibet. He also enlarged the monastery. His residence (of which only the ruins remain today) was called Pho nyi bla brang. Later, a master called gTsug phud moved the monastery to its present site<a href=\"#n38\" name=\"nb38\" class=\"note\">38<\/a> and renamed it Chu mig. According to the same legend, he was a descendant of the sPa tshang family based in Yu ring village, Central Tibet. <\/p> <p>Later, Khod po Blo gros thogs med (1280-1337) arrived in &rsquo;Dra valley and unveiled the sacred mountain (gnas ri) of &rsquo;Dra gnas the&rsquo;u bo. Among his foremost disciples there were the Seven Great Lamas. One of the seven was a master from sNya gad village situated near Chu mig Monastery.<\/p> <p>dGe bshes gYung drung bstan &rsquo;dzin, the founder of Brag ra Monastery, took Chu mig Monastery under his wing, and thus the two monasteries developed close ties during his lifetime. Hor ra bDud &rsquo;dul also came to &rsquo;Dra valley and founded Seng ge Monastery. This was the first Buddhist monastery in the area. From the time of Khyung gter &rsquo;Od zer gling pa onwards, most masters of his lineage looked after the monastery. Shar rdza bKra shis rgyal mtshan, Bya btang Tshe dbang &rsquo;gyur med, dBra ston sKal bzang bstan pa&rsquo;i rgyal mtshan visited the monastery to give teachings. In the first half of 19th century, A bdud lHun &rsquo;grub rdo rje, A lung Blo gros rgyal mtshan, Khyung po Nyi ma rgyal mtshan, O rgyan Thug rje gling pa were the successive masters of the monastery. <\/p> <p>The monastery was razed during the Cultural Revolution and rebuilt in the 1980s under the leadership of Bla ma Nor bu. Khyung dbon Rig &rsquo;dzin Yon tan rnam rgyal gave teachings there in 1990 which marked the resumption of the monastery&rsquo;s religious activities.
