   "body": "<p>The Horns (<em>ru</em>) were the top most administrative unit in Imperial Tibet, and hence the largest. They are said to have been created by the seventh century emperor Songtsen Gampo (<em>srong btsan sgam po</em>) in order to divide his domain into manageable units. Originally there were four horns named largely after directions - Central Horn (<em>dbus ru</em>), Branch Horn (<em>ru lag</em>), Right Horn (<em>g.yas ru</em>), and Left Horn (<em>g.yon ru</em>). Later two more were added with names deriving from conquered ethnicities - Sumpa Horn (<em>sum pa ru</em>) and Zhang Zhung Horn (<em>zhang zhung ru</em>).</p>
<p>After the collapse of the Tibetan Empire the four horns of Tibet, which had formed the core units of the empire, lived on as a geographical designation that persists up to the present. As such, the “four horns of Tibet” can refer to central Tibet, and is sometimes used as a political term similar to “Tibet.”<br/><br/></p>
