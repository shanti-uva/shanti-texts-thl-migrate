The site rises above the west shore of <span class=\"popular\">Yubuk Tsakha</span><span class=\"scholar\">G.yu sbug tshwa kha</span> (4560 m), a salt lake that greatly expands and shrinks in size. The presence of tombs and many petroglyphs (I-15) along the west side of the lake indicate that it has long been the focus of human settlement, despite being situated so far north. The relatively low elevation of the <span class=\"popular\">Yubuk Tsakha</span><span class=\"scholar\">G.yu sbug tshwa kha</span> basin and the 6000-m high meridian range to the west, providing ample fresh water, are the main geographic endowments accounting for this settlement. Although <span class=\"popular\">Gyaruk Möndur</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rgya rug mon dur</span> has been classed as a type II.3 monument (due to its ridge-top aspect), it has little resemblance to the average cubic tombs of this typology. <span class=\"popular\">Gyaruk Möndur</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rgya rug mon dur</span> is perhaps better classed as a type II.2 monument, but the in situ evidence does not permit a detailed analysis of its design and construction.

This dissolute structure (8 m x 8 m) is elevated 1 m to 1.4 m above ground level. Small intact wall fragments suggest that it was square in shape, although it now has a round appearance.

It is of similar construction to FS1. We might speculate that FS2 consisted of a central mound enclosed by a wall. Small traces of double-course walls make up the perimeter of this probable quadrate structure (11 m x 11 m). FS2 is elevated 1.2 m to 1.6 m above the summit. The construction of a shepherd’s shelter (<span class=\"popular emph\">droklhé</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">’brog lhas</span>) in the middle adds another 50 cm to the height of FS2.
