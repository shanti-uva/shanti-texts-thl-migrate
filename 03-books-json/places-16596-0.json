It measures 8.3 m (east wall) x 11 m (south wall) x 9.7 m (west wall) x 10.4 m (north wall). This building is generally aligned in the cardinal directions. Although none of the roof is extant in the north edifice, the walls are much straighter than the south edifice, indicating that it was largely or entirely constructed with a imber roof. Many of the walls still reach 1.5 to 2 m in height. The north edifice contains five rooms: northwest (3.5 m x 2.7 m), southwest (3 m x 3.1 m), northeast (2 m x 2.6 m), southeast (2.7 m x 2.5 m), central (6.5 m x 3.6 m), as well as a small entrance vestibule. The latrine is accessed from the southwest room. The latrine comprises a small extension of the main body of the structure. The latrine privy pit and its exterior wall opening are still intact. There is also a small courtyard on the east side of the building. Inside the courtyard there is a broken stone mortar formed from a hollowed boulder. <\/p> "},{"title":"sde chos shrine","index":9,"parent_index":6,"body":null},{"title":"mChod rten bdun bu","index":10,"parent_index":6,"body":null},{"title":"mchod rten 1","index":11,"parent_index":10,"body":null},{"title":"mchod rten 2","index":12,"parent_index":10,"body":" <p>MT2 (3 m x 3 m) is of the same design and construction as MT1.
