This religious\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcenter (<span class=\"popular emph\">sekhang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">gsas khang</span>/<span class=\"popular emph\">sekhar</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">gsas mkhar</span>) was built on the gently sloping valley floor. The surrounding terrain is sandy and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trocky but arable lands are also found in fairly close proximity. The equal degradation of the structures and the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tuniform wall types suggest that the two buildings formed an integral installation. In total, the structures\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcontain about 24 rooms as well as three latrines. This domestic arrangement might point to the tenancy of two\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdozen or more people at the site. The existence of this religious complex is probably attributable to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\textensive agricultural base that was once found in the <span class=\"popular\">Dech&ouml;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sde chos</span> valley (see A-85). The old agrarian economy likely generated the resources necessary for the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmaintenance of this fairly large nucleus of habitation. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The floor level of the two buildings is situated entirely above ground. The two edifices were constructed with\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tboth all-stone and timber roofs. These structures therefore represent an unusual hybrid type of residential\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmonument. As with other all-stone structures, <span class=\"popular\">Dech&ouml; G&ouml;npa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sde chos dgon pa</span> does not have large central halls or regularly shaped and arranged rooms. Exterior walls and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpartitions are largely intact and commonly reach 2 m in height. Much of the mud-mortar used in the 45-cm- to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t60-cm-thick random-work walls is extant. The granite blocks used in construction are primarily 20 cm to 50 cm in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlength. Although Buddhist monuments are located at the site, it is not at all clear who founded\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"popular\">Dech&ouml; G&ouml;npa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sde chos dgon pa</span>. Either the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBonpo or Buddhists could have established this archaic facility. The early\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinhabitants of Upper Tibet, however, did not usually favor valley bottom sites\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand a fully above-ground aspect for the construction of their <span class=\"popular emph\">sekhang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">gsas\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tkhang</span>.

The perimeter of this structure measures approximately 70 m. In addition, there is a forward or east\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcourtyard that measures 10 m (north-south) x 5 m (east-west). The walls enclosing this open space have crumbled\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto their foundations. There appear to have been three east entrances to the south edifice. On the exterior south\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tside of the south edifice there is a 50-cm high parapet wall, adding significantly to the building&rsquo;s\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\televation.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The 60-m wide north entrance is positioned outside the courtyard and accesses a north wing that seems to have\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconstituted five rooms. None of the internal entrances between these rooms have survived in the fragmentary wall\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpartitions. The northeast room (2.2 m x 2.8 m) of the north wing has a niche in the north wall. An L-shaped room\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmeasures 3 m x 3 m on its long sides. The other three rooms of the north wing are each around 8 m&sup2;. None of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\troof has persisted in the north wing, but evidence from other parts of the south edifice suggests that it was\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconstructed with both stone and timber roofing materials.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The entrance to the central wing of the south edifice was obliterated along with the wall in which it was\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbuilt. The central entrance was situated inside the courtyard. The central wing of the facility apparently had\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsix rooms. Among the rooms in this portion of the structure is a latrine in the southeast corner of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbuilding. It has a hole in the floor that is conveyed to a privy pit with an east-facing opening at the base of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe exterior wall. The largest room in the central wing is the central north room (5 m x 3.5 m). This relatively\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlarge room with its long straight walls must have been built with a timber roof. The other five rooms are\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsignificantly smaller and may have had stone roofs. There is a niche in a wall of the northwest room and one in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe southwest room. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The south entrance gains entry to the south wing of the building with its seven small rooms and latrine. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tirregularly-shaped rear room has corbels attached to the tops of the walls, indicating that a stone integument\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcovered them. The largest room in the south wing is the central north specimen (2.7 m x 3.2 m). There are two\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tniches in the north wall of this room. From the central north room there is an entranceway (1 m x 50 cm) to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twest compartment and an entranceway (1.1 m x 50 cm) to the south compartment (situated in the southwest corner\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the south edifice). There are two niches and a recess (1 m x 50 cm) in the west compartment. Many of the roof\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcorbels in the tiny west room are in situ. The maximum floor-to-ceiling height of the west room is 1.8 m.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAccounting for the corbels, bridging stones and sheathing slabs, the total height of the west room must have\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen around 2.2 m. The stone roof in the south room (1.8 m x 1.5 m) is partly intact. The floor-to-ceiling\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\theight of this room is around 1.6 m.
