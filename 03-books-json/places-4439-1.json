Its altitude averages 4,350 meters (i.e. 14,271 feet). To the west is <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Ladakh</span> (<span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\"><em>la dwags</em></span>), which is under the jurisdiction of <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kashmir</span> (<span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\"><em>ka shi rmir</em></span>), northern <span class=\"place\" title=\"F425\">India</span>. It shares a border with <span class=\"place\" title=\"F4572\">Rutok</span> (<span class=\"place\" title=\"F4572\"><em>ru thog</em></span>) county in the northwest; in the northeast it traces the border of <span class=\"place\" title=\"F4716\">Gegyé</span> county (<span class=\"place\" title=\"F4716\"><em>dge rgyas rdzong</em></span>); in the east it connects with <span class=\"place\" title=\"F3873\">Puhreng</span> (<span class=\"place\" title=\"F3873\"><em>spou hreng</em></span>) county; to the south, it connects with the lower part of the grasslands. From its northwestern to southeastern edges, the county covers a large distance, while the area from south to north covers a short distance. The sum total extent of the county is little more than 12,115 square kilometers. Although quite high and dry, the line of the <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Tsangpo</span> (<span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\"><em>gtsang po</em></span>) and the <span class=\"place\" title=\"F10659\">Senggé Tsangpo</span> (<span class=\"place\" title=\"F10659\"><em>seng ge gtsang po</em></span>) rivers run through it, and the area contains more than a few tamarisk tree forests, and even some willows grow there. Its northern and southern borders are encircled by a ring of snow-covered mountains, numbering a little more than two hundred in all, the tallest of which rise more than 6,700 meters (i.e. 21,981 feet) above sea level.</p>
<p>‘<span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Gar</span>’ signifies a military encampment. The end of the 17th century, during the rule of <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Senggé Namgyel</span> (<span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\"><em>seng ge rnam rgyal</em></span>), the king of <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Ladakh</span>, occasioned the consolidation of political power over the territory traditionally controlled by the Tibetan government under one prefecture as a zone of control. In that land was located the military encampment of the high-ranking martial commander, <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Ganden Tsewang Pelzangpo</span> (<span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\"><em>dga’ ldan tshe dbang dpal bzang po</em></span>). In the end, subsequent to his campaigns there, after striking the tents of his military encampment, he established a center of government. Thus, did its name  - <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">gar</span> (‘encampment’) – arise. The name of the executive command is <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Garugur</span> (<span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\"><em>sgar dbu gur</em></span>) – literally, ‘tent at the center of the encampment’ – or the <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Töngari Garpön</span> (<span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\"><em>stod mnga' ris sgar dpon</em></span>) - literally, 'the military commander of Western Tibet’.  Their winter residence is called the <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Gargünsa</span> (<span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\"><em>sgar dgun sa</em></span>) – literally, ‘the site of the winter encampment’; and the summer residence is called the <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Garyarsa</span> (<span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\"><em>sgar dbyar sa</em></span>) – literally, ‘the site of the summer encampment’. In the Western year 1959, democratic reforms were launched. In 1960, the Gar County People’s Government was established; and while in the year 1969, the county of <span class=\"place\" title=\"F4439\">Gar</span> was brought under the control of the revolutionary commission, in 1979 the Gar County People’s Government was restored. Its center of government was established at the winter residence, <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Gargünsa</span>, a lush area of both water and grasses. During the summer of 1989, it was relocated to the steppe of <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Ting Drumtsé</span> (<span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\"><em>rting grums rtse</em></span>) near <span class=\"place\" title=\"F3862\">Ngari</span>'s central city, <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Senggé Khabab</span>, [77] and has remained there until the present day.</p>
<p>In the past, its subordinate colonies included the following: <span class=\"place\" title=\"F4516\">Möntser</span> (<span class=\"place\" title=\"F4516\"><em>mon mtsher</em></span>), a place in modern day <span class=\"place\" title=\"F5263\">Arunachal Pradesh</span>, <span class=\"place\" title=\"F425\">India</span>. When the Bhutanese (<span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Lhodrükpa</span>, <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\"><em>lho 'grug pa</em></span>) <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kagyü</span> (<span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\"><em>bka' brgyud</em></span>) administered government before the precious snow mountain (<span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">gang rinpoché</span>, <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\"><em>gangs rin po che</em></span>) – <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15459\">Mount Kailash</span> – the temporary residence or dwelling place of the <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Mön</span>, as it was their nomadic region, it was named accordingly; it is the winter site which is located at <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Gargünsa</span>, <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Trashi Gang</span> (<span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\"><em>bkra shis sgang</em></span>) which is located adjacent to <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Trashi Gang Monastery</span>.</p>
