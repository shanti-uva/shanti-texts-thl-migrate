Before 1959, the\n                        monastery had forty-seven monks. At present, it is a moderate-sized Bonpo\n                        monastery of thirty-one monks, with an assembly hall, a temple, monks&rsquo;\n                        quarters and other buildings. It has religious objects appropriate to its\n                        size and needs, such as statues of sTon pa Khri gtsug rgyal ba, Dran pa nam\n                        mkha&rsquo;, his son Tshe dbang rig &rsquo;dzin, sTag la me &rsquo;bar and Srid pa rgyal mo,\n                        thangka, <em xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\">the bKa&rsquo; &rsquo;gyur</em>, and other books\n                        concerning religious practice.
