In addition to rammed-earth, adobe block and masonry edifices,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthere are subterranean facilities in both complexes. The highest portion of the two complexes is dominated by a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsingle large rammed-earth structure. It seems likely that these high status edifices represent a subsequent\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tredevelopment of the site. The variety of structures and constructional techniques at <span class=\"popular\">Sharlang Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Shar lang mkhar</span> suggest that the site went through\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvarious stages of development over the centuries.

A curtain-wall that spanned the distance between the two\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcomplexes served as an important defensive feature, which was designed to restrict access to the site.

In total, there were at least 60 rooms constructed here. Most walls in the southwest\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcomplex are made from adobe blocks and attain a maximum elevation of 4 m. Some of these adobe walls have course\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof cobbles integrated into them.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Access to the southwest complex is by way of a small hole that was cut into the north face of the summit. This\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\taccess point was created after the collapse of the original route to the installation. The hole is conveyed to a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcave within the citadel. Inside the southwest complex the north side of the formation has cobble wall fragments\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twith intervening courses of sandstone slabs, up to 3 m in height, embedded in it. Certain walls also have\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsandstone-slab bases. Some structures were hewn into the top of the summit along the south side of the complex\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto create a semi-subterranean network of rooms. They are, however, in very poor condition. The adobe blocks used\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin the construction of the various buildings were of a standard size: 40 cm x 20 cm x 10 cm. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>On the south side of the summit, facing east, there is a line of three caves. The north cave (3.4 m x 1.9 m)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thas three recesses in the rear, the largest of which is 1.3 m deep and 1 m high. Like other caves and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsubterranean passageways at <span class=\"popular\">Sharlang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Shar lang</span>, this\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcave has an approximately 2-m tall ceiling. The south cave (5.3 m x 2.8 m) has a deep arched recess in the rear\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twall and one recess in a side wall. There are also several niches in the walls. The middle cave (3.4 m x 1.9 m)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\talso has a large recess in the rear.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>There are also caves in the north portion of the summit. In some places their roofs have collapsed, leaving\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgaping holes in the summit. The largest cave in the north of the complex (3.3 m x 3 m) has a 1.6-m deep bay in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe rear wall. In the right wall there is a niche (1 m x 1.3 m) partly enclosed by a masonry wall. Also on the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tright wall of this cave there is a mud and stone closet (1 m x 55 cm x 1 m) with two openings in its base. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfunction of these appointments is not readily apparent. The largest cave in the north of the complex is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconnected to the summit by a 2.8-m long passageway. The exterior entrance of this passageway has an in situ\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstone lintel and sill. The ceiling of the passageway is lined with stones, which in design is not unlike that of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tan all-stone corbelled roof. Moreover, parts of its two walls are lined in cobble masonry. On the right side of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe passageway there is a 1-m deep recess below the floor level. In a nearby cave (4.4 m x 3.3 m) there are two\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1.6-m deep bays cut into the rear wall. Beside the bays there is a mud-plastered masonry wall creating an\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tenclosed space (1 m x 90 cm x 70 cm).</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>There is an axial corridor along the south portion of the summit. Also on the south portion of the summit, an\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tadobe-block wall has a stone lintel over an entranceway (1.4 m x 70 cm). Another constructional feature of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsouthwest complex is walls made of cobbles and sandstone slabs embedded into a light-colored clay and mud\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmatrix. A 6-m high fragment of this unusual wall type is also found in the north portion of the complex. Another\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsalient architectonic trait is the presence of a window (35 cm x 30 cm) in one wall. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Northeast complex","index":9,"parent_index":6,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The northeast complex (22 m x 18 m) contains a much smaller group of dilapidated buildings than the southwest\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcomplex.

This is a tunnel (15\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tm long, 1.5 m wide, 3 m high) that drops down 5 m to a ledge situated below the curtain-wall that joins the two\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcomplexes of <span class=\"popular\">Sharlang Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Shar lang mkhar</span>.
