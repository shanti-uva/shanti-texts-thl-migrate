The single pillar stands on a broad, gentle slope in close proximity to a winter\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpastoral camp. The pillar (1.7 m [height] x 1.6 m [basal girth]) is irregularly shaped and highly worn. The beige\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstone has weathered to a much darker color. Stones have been piled up around the base of the pillar including\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpieces of locally occurring milky quartz.
