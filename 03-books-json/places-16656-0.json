The single pillar stands on a broad, gentle slope in close proximity to a winter pastoral camp. The pillar (1.7 m [height] x 1.6 m [basal girth]) is irregularly shaped and highly worn. The beige stone has weathered to a much darker color. Stones have been piled up around the base of the pillar including pieces of locally occurring milky quartz. White scarves (<span class=\"popular emph\">khatak<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">kha btags<\/span>) and prayer flags (<span class=\"popular emph\">lungta<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rlung rta<\/span>) have been tied around the stone, and butter has been repeatedly dabbed on its upper section. Incense is also burnt at the site. Evidently, <span class=\"popular\">Sakti Doring<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Sag thi rdo ring<\/span> is a local cult monument.
