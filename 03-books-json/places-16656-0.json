   "body": "<p> <span class=\"popular\">Sakti Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sag thi rdo ring</span> is located on the left side of the eponymous valley, an effluent of the <span class=\"popular\">Chukar Tsango</span><span class=\"scholar\">Chu dkar gtsang po</span>. The single pillar stands on a broad, gentle slope in close proximity to a winter pastoral camp. The pillar (1.7 m [height] x 1.6 m [basal girth]) is irregularly shaped and highly worn. The beige stone has weathered to a much darker color. Stones have been piled up around the base of the pillar including pieces of locally occurring milky quartz. White scarves (<span class=\"popular emph\">khatak</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">kha btags</span>) and prayer flags (<span class=\"popular emph\">lungta</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rlung rta</span>) have been tied around the stone, and butter has been repeatedly dabbed on its upper section. Incense is also burnt at the site. Evidently, <span class=\"popular\">Sakti Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sag thi rdo ring</span> is a local cult monument. The use of ancient pillars for contemporary religious purposes is much more common in the <span class=\"popular\">Gugé</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ge</span> region than it is in the <span class=\"popular\">Jangtang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Byang thang</span>. The original function of lone pillars in <span class=\"popular\">Gugé</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ge</span> such as <span class=\"popular\">Sakti Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sag thi rdo ring</span> is not clear. </p>",
