The enclosure was constructed primarily of white granite cobbles and does not appear to have been well aligned in the compass points. Except for the relatively intact south wall, only small fragments of the enclosure have survived. The enclosure measures 7.5 m (north-south) x 9.5 m (east-west). There appear to be seven pillars clustered near he west end of the enclosure, of which, all but two of them have been broken. The two tallest specimens measure 1.1 m (height) x 1.4 m (basal girth) x 8 cm (thickness) and 1 m x 1.3 m x 20 cm. The next tallest specimen (75 cm) is also tabular. The other broken pillars are significantly shorter. Broken parts of pillars and other stones are heaped around the in situ menhirs. <\/p> "},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":" <p>None was collected.<\/p>  "}]}
