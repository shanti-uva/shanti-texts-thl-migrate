The site is obscured by much <span class=\"popular emph\">drama</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">gra ma</span> brush growth. <span class=\"popular\">Ukpalung Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">’Ug pa lung rdo ring</span> is in eyeshot of the great citadel of <span class=\"popular\">Wangchuk Gönpo Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dbang phyug mgon po mkhar</span> (A-51). In the pre-modern period it was used to enshrine <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma ṇi</span> plaques, some of which are still intact. The enclosure was constructed primarily of white granite cobbles and does not appear to have been well aligned in the compass points. Except for the relatively intact south wall, only small fragments of the enclosure have survived. The enclosure measures 7.5 m (north-south) x 9.5 m (east-west). There appear to be seven pillars clustered near he west end of the enclosure, of which, all but two of them have been broken. The two tallest specimens measure 1.1 m (height) x 1.4 m (basal girth) x 8 cm (thickness) and 1 m x 1.3 m x 20 cm. The next tallest specimen (75 cm) is also tabular. The other broken pillars are significantly shorter. Broken parts of pillars and other stones are heaped around the in situ menhirs. </p>",
