At the beginning, the king ruled only <span class=\"place\" title=\"NO ID\"><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">M&eacute; Ruma Tsowa</span></span> (<em>dme ru ma tsho ba</em>) in <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Ngawa Marma</span> (<em>rnga ba mar ma</em>). Later <span class=\"place\" title=\"F23748\">Metsang</span>&rsquo;s territory expanded. The neighboring communities and <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">tsowa </span>(<em>tsho ba</em>)<sup><a name=\"n1\" href=\"#fn1\">[1]</a></sup> came under <span class=\"place\" title=\"F23748\">Metsang </span>through their submission, marriage and warfare. Under the king there were ministers who served as chief advisors on internal affairs and relations with the outside. The ministers made sure that the king&rsquo;s orders were followed. Usually the positions of the ministers were hereditary, but capable ordinary people who won the trust of the king would be appointed as the ministers, too. Under the ministers, there was a lower level of leadership called <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">g&ouml;po </span>(<em>rgod po</em>) and they were recommended to the king based on their abilities by the elderly. <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Tsomi </span>(<em>tsho mi</em>) was the lowest level of leadership working at the village level.</p>\n<p>There was a <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">nyerwa </span>(<em>gnyer ba</em>) or a manager responsible for managing the affairs within and outside of the village as well as the village properties. <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Nyerwa </span>was chosen by <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">g&ouml;po </span>and made official by the king. The village militia officer (<span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">makp&ouml;n</span>, <em>dmag dpon</em>) or the person leading the village militia was also recommended based on the person&rsquo;s courage and intelligence by <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">g&ouml;po</span>. Generally, each village had one militia officer. Large  villages normally would have two officers, while the small villages had only one officer and often the village leader was the officer. However, the militia positions were temporary because once a war was over their authority was also gone.</p>\n<p>During the heyday of <span class=\"place\" title=\"F23748\">Metsang</span>, under the king there were thirteen ministers. The upper, lower and middle divisions of <span class=\"place\" title=\"F23748\">Metsang </span>had two militia officers each, and <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">M&eacute; Ruma</span> had two officers, eight banner officers (<span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">makp&ouml;n dardzin gy&eacute;</span>, <em>dmag dpon dar &lsquo;dzin brgyad</em>), and 100 <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">bap&ouml;n </span>(<em>sba dpon</em>)<em>, </em>whose function is unclear. Each of the three divisions of <span class=\"place\" title=\"F23748\">Metsang </span>had four sub-divisions. These twelve subdivisions were considered as <span class=\"place\" title=\"F23748\">Metsang</span>&rsquo;s &ldquo;inner villages&rdquo; (<span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">nangd&eacute;</span>, <em>nang sde</em>). According to their economic circumstances, the households were divided into five categories, namely <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">yangrap </span>(<em>yang rab</em>), <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">khyimrap </span>(<em>khyim rab</em>), <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">khyimdring </span>(<em>khyim &lsquo;bring</em>), <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">khyimta </span>(<em>khyim tha</em>), and <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">yangta </span>(<em>yang tha</em>). Based on their economic status, the families were required to provide various services and duties such as taxes.</p>\n<p>The <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">lhad&eacute; </span>(<em>lha sde</em>)<sup><a name=\"n2\" href=\"#fn2\">[2]</a></sup> villages of <span class=\"place\" title=\"F23346\">Kirti Monastery</span> (<em>ki rti dgon</em>) did not belong to <span class=\"place\" title=\"F23748\">Metsang </span>and they were not subject to the king of <span class=\"place\" title=\"F23748\">M&eacute;</span>. Nevertheless, the king helped Kirti Rinpoche (<em>ki rti rin po che</em>)<em> </em>rule these <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">lhad&eacute; </span>villages. The relationship between the king and Kirti Rinpoche was one of <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ch&ouml;y&ouml;n </span>(<em>mchod yon</em>, or<em> </em>priest and patron), and it was established around 1760 during the reign of King Ts&eacute;wang Kyap (<em>tse dbang skyabs</em>), who invited the fifth Kirti Rinpoche to his home and made offerings.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Reference </strong></p>\n<p>Hor gtsang &lsquo;jigs med, <em>Mdo smad lo rgyus chen mo las sde tsho&rsquo;i skor glegs bam dang bo </em>[The first volume of sde tsho (communities and tsho ba) in The Greater History of Amdo], Library of Tibetan Works &amp; Archives.
