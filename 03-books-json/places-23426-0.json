It is a traditional &ldquo;Tantric\n                        monastery&rdquo;, small but influential, and has been in a state of stability with\n                        no serious ups and downs for a long time. History does not tell clearly the\n                        individual names of every lama who has cared for and protected the monastery\n                        so far, but it is said that descendants in the Ko bo lineage, one of the\n                        three descent groups of the region called Ko bo, Rag shi and Shel sku took\n                        care of the monastery and rendered great service in keeping, defending and\n                        spreading the doctrine of Eternal Bon.</p>\n\n                     <p>Later, in the Fifteenth Rab byung, Me ston Nyi ma rgyal mtshan, a hermit\n                        from Brag dmar ri &rsquo;dun in Khyung po, and sTag zhig Rin chen dbang ldan, a\n                        disciple of Grub chen sMon lam rgyal mtshan, on their way to Kong po,\n                        established a close patron-priest relationship with the villagers and monks\n                        of rGyal shod. Acceding to the wishes expressed by the Shel sku villagers,\n                        these hermits decided to take care of the dNgul kho Monastery.</p>\n\n                     <p>Several years after that, sTag zhig Rin dbang, accompanied by some others,\n                        arrived in rGyal shod and became the head of this monastery.</p>\n\n                     <p>At the end of the Fifteenth Rab byung, dNgul kho Monastery was moved from\n                        dNgul kho village to the western outskirts, midway up the slope of the\n                        mountain. It now takes about twenty minutes to go up to the monastery by\n                        car.</p>\n\n                     <p>When the monastery was built, Ban dkar stag phu chos rje Ngag dbang bstan\n                        &rsquo;dzing rgya mtsho, who was of the dGe lugs pa school, gave a huge amount of\n                        tea, grain and the like, by way of offering congratulations for the\n                        completion of the monastery.</p>\n\n                     <p>Having fully completed dNgul kho Monastery with excellent buildings and\n                        religious objects, sTag zhig Rin dbang summoned all the monks of the Eternal\n                        Bon monasteries and hermitages in rGyal shod district to his monastery and\n                        performed the &ldquo;medicine rite&rdquo; (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">sman sgrub</span>) based on the\n                           <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">Khro bo &rsquo;od zer &rsquo;khyil ba</span>. This was the first time\n                        such a rite, on such a grand scale, was performed in the region. He bestowed\n                        upon the participants all the teachings they wished for. Not only that,\n                        according to the manner of each monastic community, he continually arranged\n                        plentiful offerings and brought back the lost rules of the regular services\n                        of dNgul kho Monastery and recruited more monks and lay practitioners than\n                        before.</p>\n\n                     <p>Since this lama himself relied upon those laymen who had taken some vows, he\n                        obtained the real nature of power of wisdom and compassion by means of\n                        Tantric practices.
