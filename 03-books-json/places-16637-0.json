The seven <span class=\"popular emph\">do khang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rdo khang</span> of the island have an eastern aspect and are not well aligned\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin the cardinal directions. Two of them were erected near the shoreline, while the other five were built at\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvarious elevations along the rocky core of the island. The five <span class=\"popular emph\">do khang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rdo khang</span> of the main settlement were spaced quite widely apart, ostensibly for privacy. The robustly\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbuilt edifices may potentially have been occupied for centuries. The durability of the stonework was reinforced by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsetting the structures partly underground and by the use of prominent revetments.

A rock outcrop\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tforms part of the perimeter of this enclosure. The forward wall of the enclosure stands 1.3 m above the slope,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhile the rear wall was set 1.2 m below the slope. In the rear wall of the enclosure there is a deep recess\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(70 cm x 50 cm x 90 cm) with an intact lintel. The maximum height of the east/forward wall of the building\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\titself is 2.7 m on the exterior and 1.4 m on the interior, the difference being made up by a prominent\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trevetment. The central portion of this revetment and much of the forward wall of RS7 has been destroyed. RS7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcontains both forward/east and rear/west tiers of rooms. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The forward tier of RS7 has four rooms: northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest. The northeast room has\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen nearly obliterated. The roof of the northwest room is partly intact. The southeast room (1.9 x 1.5 m,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfloor-to-ceiling height: 1.4 m) is also partly integral. There is a niche in the south wall of this room at\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfloor level. Although largely destroyed, the southwest room has a little of its roof intact. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The rear tier of RS7 consists of two rooms: north and south. The forward/east wall of the rear tier is 2 m to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2.4 m high, plus a parapet wall that adds another 30 cm to its overall height. The rear/west wall is flush\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twith the slope on its south end and raised 50 cm above the slope on the north end. Each room has its own\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\teast-facing entrance. The roof of the south room (1.5 m x 1.7 m, floor-to-ceiling height: 2 m) is almost\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcompletely intact. The entrance to this room measures 90 cm x 60 cm. The roof of the north room (2.4 m x 1.7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tm, floor-to-ceiling height: 2 m) is not in as good condition as its counterpart. Above the entranceway (1.1 m\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tx 60 cm) of the north room there is a small window opening. Inside the north room there are two adobe and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstone platforms. The south platform spans an entire wall and has a large cavity underneath half of it. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnorth platform is smaller and may possibly be the remains of a hearth (although no fire pit is discernable).\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThere is a small niche in the east wall of the north room, just south of the entrance. A white pigment was\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tused to scrawl Buddhist inscriptions on the south wall. From east to west they read: <span class=\"popular emph\">ma</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma</span>, <span class=\"popular emph\">syam</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">syam</span>, <span class=\"popular emph\">kham</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">kham</span>, and <span class=\"popular emph\">A</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">a&rsquo;</span> (three\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\texamples). On the south wall there are also dots and linear designs. The incomplete mantra <span class=\"popular emph\">om\nma ni</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">o&#7747; ma &#7751;i</span> is found written on the west wall. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>An enclosure (5.1 m x 3.2 m) is found 12 m east of RS7 at slightly lower elevation. Its forward wall is 1.2 m\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thigh on the exterior side and 60 cm high on the interior. The rear wall of the enclosure is set 80 cm below\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe slope. Part of the perimeter wall is made up of rock outcrops. Such a structure could have had a variety\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof utilitarian or ritual functions. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n"}]}
