Among the most prominent of these structures is a single-course quadrate enclosure, which is not aligned in the cardinal directions (2.8 m x 2.1 m). Only one of its perimeter walls is fully intact. It consists of larger upright stones (up to 60 cm long), which protrude 10 cm to 20 cm above ground level. Just 60 cm northeast of this structure is a double-course slab-wall segment (3 m long) composed of upright slabs (10 cm to 30 cm long), which are flush with the ground surface. This slab wall is about 30 cm in hickness. Other slab-wall fragments are found 5.5 m to the northwest. These double-course fragments are of the same construction and are 80 cm to 1.2 m in thickness.
