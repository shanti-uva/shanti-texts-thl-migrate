This enclosure is elevated 30 cm\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto 80 cm above the circumjacent terrain. The very substantial, double-course perimeter walls (70 cm to 1.1 m\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthick) are primarily composed of sandstone slabs laid flat. These variable-length slabs (up to 1 m long) are\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstacked to create walls that are two to five vertical courses in height (15 cm to 25 cm high). There are also a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfew slabs laid edgewise in the ground to form the double-course perimeter walls. There is an east-west oriented\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twall that extends 5 m beyond the west corner of the enclosure. This wall fragment is of an unclear design. There\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tis also a curved wall that extends 5.5 m beyond the south corner of the enclosure. This tail-like wall extension\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tis primarily composed of upright slabs, up to 90 cm in length, which project as much as 45 cm above ground level.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe interior of the enclosure is devoid of structural elements, but there are some stones strewn around it.
