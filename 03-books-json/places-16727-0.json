This monument is either identical with or closely related to the walled pillars (II.1b) common farther west\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin Upper Tibet. The quadrate enclosure is fairly well aligned in the cardinal\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdirections, and measures 10 m (east-west) x 7 m (north-south). The enclosure is highly deteriorated and most of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe stones used to build it are now dislodged. The only intact double-course perimeter wall fragments are found\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin the north wall (70 cm thick) and east wall (80 cm thick). It could not be determined if the entire perimeter\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twas built in a similar regimented fashion. The perimeter walls are composed of variable-length uncut metamorphic\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tblocks and slabs (10 cm to 50 cm long), which are flush with the ground level or which project above it to a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmaximum height of 30 cm. The west wall is slightly depressed and the east wall is somewhat elevated in order to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcreate a level interior space. In the east wall there is a stone 75 cm in length set perpendicular to the wall\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcourse. This stone may have been one side of an opening or &lsquo;portal&rsquo; in the wall (as is found is certain other\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\texamples of the typology). In the middle of the enclosure there is an arched single line of stones (3 m long)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tembedded in the ground. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>On the west side of the enclosure there is a collapsed tabular white granite pillar. This highly eroded pillar\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tis 2 m in length and has a girth of 1 m. It appears to have stood near the west edge of the enclosure and to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thave been well centered between the north and south walls. According to the local guide, <span class=\"popular\">Shangpa G&ouml;npo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Shang pa mgon po</span> (born circa 1934), this pillar\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfell down before living memory. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Funerary enclosures","index":8,"parent_index":6,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Funerary Structure FS1","index":9,"parent_index":8,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Funerary structure FS1 (3 m x 4 m) is the most northerly funerary structure at the site.
