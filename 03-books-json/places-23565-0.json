He was a disciple of bSod nams g-yung drung, an abbot\n                        of sMan ri Monastery (No.1).

After completing his studies he\n                        began to practise meditation in many hermitages throughout Amdo and Khams\n                        and finally founded gTo lung Yang dben dpal dgon in gTo khog.<a href=\"#n30\" name=\"nb30\" class=\"note\">30</a> In his time, there were about a hundred monks in the monastery.

The latter became\n                        the abbot of rGyal rong Monastery and founded a new monastery called gZhung\n                        ring (No. 160). During his time, lHa brtan Padma rnam rgyal, a dGe lugs pa\n                        master, came to gTo khog and succeeded in converting rGyal rong Monastery to\n                        the dGe lugs pa tradition.
