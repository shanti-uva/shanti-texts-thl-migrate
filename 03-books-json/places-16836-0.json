The site is situated on the highest of the shelves, which is perched\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tabout 100 m above the lake basin. Four enclosures that appear to have a funerary function were constructed on this\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trock- and gravel-strewn shelf. The perimeter walls of the enclosures are of the heaped-stone type, some portions\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof which are so well-developed as to approximate double-course wall types. The orderly stacking of masonry was\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfacilitated by the angular faces of the stones. All four of these enclosures have interiors free of structural\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\telements. They are constructed of uncut dark-colored metamorphic (?) rocks 10 cm to 1 m in length. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>According to local sources, <span class=\"popular\">P&ouml;ri M&ouml;ndur</span><span class=\"scholar\">Spos ri mon dur</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tis associated with the ancient <span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span>.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Site elements","index":6,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Funerary Structure FS1","index":7,"parent_index":6,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Funerary structure FS1 (dimensions are unavailable) is the easternmost structure at the site.
