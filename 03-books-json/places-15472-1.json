All recognize that each culture has its own specific contexts and power groups, but there are similarities in evolutionary models, which are useful for understanding <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15472\">Labrang</span>&rsquo;s (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"F15472\">bla brang</span></em>) monastic and lay community at large. Here, the focus is on the structures of the <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15472\">Labrang</span> Monastery&rsquo;s support communities, made up of predominantly nomadic and semi-nomadic groups in the surrounding areas. At the outset it is important to remember that the nomad society had different values, economies, and lifestyles than those of nearby lowland agricultural and predominantly sedentary societies. Agricultural communities had their locally defined authority structures, also with similar evolutions, for example from small subsistence level communities, to larger villages, and eventually regional groups. In nomadic areas like the <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15472\">Labrang</span> properties, its community-at-large, ownership of land, monetary and currency exchange, law and enforcement, and all social processes were all very different from those of surrounding cultures, and even more different from those in the modern west.</p>\n"},{"title":"Community Divisions","index":2,"parent_index":0,"body":"\n<p>Nomadic areas were characterized by small groups called &ldquo;<span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">tsowa</span>&rdquo; (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">tsho ba</span></em>) led by chiefs, or prominent men who were able to establish themselves by their strength, leadership qualities, skill, and intelligence. The small groups might be understood as tribes, extended clan groups, and combinations of clan groups with leaders who received recognition and offerings of goods from the community in gestures of privilege, legitimization, and loyalty. The group also made offerings to <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15472\">Labrang</span> or one of its branch monasteries, and sent young boys to the monastery for ordination. Again, these <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">tsowa</span>&nbsp;groups included extended clans, but often included persons not biologically related.</p>\n<p>The second stage of community authority structures were combined <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">tsowa</span> &nbsp;groups, often called <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">shokpa</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\">shog pa</span></em>) &ndash; literally &ldquo;section&rdquo; or &ldquo;wing.&rdquo; The leaders of these combined <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">shokpa</span> groups were tribal or collected clan chiefs who were able to extend their power over a larger area and greater number of people, beyond the borders of their home group. This larger group leadership status was a result of bravery in battle against common enemies, of community consensus, sometimes reinforced by marriage alliances, natural leadership skills, or as a result of mutual economic benefit. This level of community authority required inter-group diplomacy and negotiation, over matters of pasture, and other concerns appropriate to <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15348\">Amdo</span> (<span class=\"place\" title=\"F15348\"><em>a mdo</em></span>) highlands life.</p>\n<p>The third level of community authority structure consisted of combinations of these <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">shokpa</span> groups. Leadership of these groups required more diplomacy and negotiation between <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">shokpa</span><em> </em>groups relatively distant from one another, outside of their respective homelands. While individual or small groups of <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">shokpa</span> could and did form relations with a <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15472\">Labrang</span> lama&rsquo;s estate, the larger units, like <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Ng&uuml;lra</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">ngul rwa</span></em>), <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dz&ouml;g&eacute; Nyinma</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">mdzod dge nyin ma</span></em>), and all eight of <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15472\">Labrang</span>&rsquo;s extended properties, usually consisted of several <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">shokpa</span> in each property. <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Ng&uuml;lra</span>, for example, had three <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">shokpa</span>, <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Ngawa</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">nga ba</span></em>) had six, <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dz&ouml;g&eacute; Mema</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">mdzod dge smad ma</span></em>) had five, and so on. These large groups formed long-term relationships with <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15472\">Labrang</span> Monastery, and generally accepted the political leadership of <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15472\">Labrang</span>, in the permanent office of resident <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">gowa</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">go ba</span></em>) or other monastery-appointed official. This was a representative of the monastery who lived in the usually combined <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">shokpa</span> groups for three-year terms. They had the task of mediating disputes, providing religious services, looking after monastery livestock, and to the extent possible with the monastery&rsquo;s broad powers, providing for community security.</p>\n<p>In sum, the three levels of community authority were individual tribal units (<span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">tsowa</span>), groups of individual tribal units (<span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">shokpa</span>), and groups of <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">shokpa</span>. There were variations to this general pattern based on economy, whether agrarian or livestock management, on population, on leadership preferences and alliances, on wealth, and other factors.</p>\n"},{"title":"Ethnic Diversity in the Region","index":3,"parent_index":0,"body":"\n<p><span class=\"place\" title=\"F15472\">Labrang</span>&rsquo;s social, political, and economic infrastructures were unique. In addition, <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15472\">Labrang</span>&rsquo;s value system, or its sense of identity was also defined in unique ways, very much in contrast to those of its close neighbors, the Chinese and the regional Muslim groups. There were variable value systems in the <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15348\">Amdo</span> region. The largest group were the nomadic Tibetans (and the regional Mongol nomad groups who assimilated Tibetan systems), with their constellations of Buddhist and regional religions. The local groups of Hui and Salar Muslims were distinct because of Islam, and their own community traditions, mostly agricultural, mercantile, and to a lesser extent highland nomadic. By far the most different ethnographic definitions in relation to the nomadic Tibetans in the greater <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15348\">Amdo</span> region were those of the neighboring Chinese. Regional Chinese groups defined their civilization in Confucian terms, by their unique language and culture, their dynastic heritage, their largely agricultural heritage, and in a few words, their fundamental values.</p>\n<p>In contrast to the Chinese and Muslims, the <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15472\">Labrang</span> Tibetans identified themselves as Buddhists, heirs to the traditions of the ancient Tibetan empire, the well known sagas of Gesar, and for those connected to <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15472\">Labrang</span> the proud bearers of central Tibetan Buddhist traditions. The <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15472\">Labrang</span> Tibetans&rsquo; nomadic lifestyles, their community group structures, their collected religious values and <span class=\"place\" title=\"F637\">Lhasa</span>-related heritage, and their vision of the world set them apart from their neighbors. The close proximity of these distinctly different groups stimulated even stronger assertion of personal and local community identity. These factors together provided powerful incentives for community solidarity. That is, maintaining one&rsquo;s personal and community commitment to <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15472\">Labrang</span> Monastery, paying taxes, providing corv&eacute;e, and participating in community rituals provided collective identity and strength, both metaphysical and in times of crisis, militia protection.</p>\n<p>The important requirements of membership in the <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15472\">Labrang</span> communities included a knowledge of local Tibetan language, sensitivity to the very diverse range of religious values, acceptance of the authority of the monastery and the monastic authorities, and acceptance of one&rsquo;s personal and community commitment to the monastery. There were law codes, and punishment for severe transgressions, but in general petty law enforcement was a local community matter. Community members were required to observe community standards and accepted practices, but failure to pay taxes or to provide corv&eacute;e were not punishable offences; such transgressions rather resulted is disassociation of the group from the larger community, or in individual cases, banishment. Inability to pay often resulted in reduced or deferred payment. In some cases corv&eacute;e responsibility and sponsorship of religious events could be met by proxy. In sum, there was a broad range of tangible and intangible or religious incentives for membership in the <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15472\">Labrang</span> <em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">labrang</span></em>.</p>\n"},{"title":"Revenue Generating Properties","index":4,"parent_index":0,"body":"\n<p><span class=\"place\" title=\"F15472\">Labrang</span> Monastery&rsquo;s revenue generating properties, its &ldquo;corporate estate&rdquo; or in Tibetan, its <em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">labrang</span>&nbsp;</em>(<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">bla brang</span></em>) included the site of monastery itself and all of its properties. These properties were the monastery&rsquo;s &ldquo;community-at-large,&rdquo; and were most often made up of <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">tsowa</span> and <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">shokpa</span> groups. There were different categories of relationships between the monastery and its revenue generating properties. The two primary categories were &ldquo;divine communities&rdquo; and &ldquo;lay communities.&rdquo; Its fully owned properties were the &ldquo;divine communities&rdquo; (<span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">lhad&eacute;</span>,&nbsp;<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">lha sde</span></em>), meaning &ldquo;communities in the service of the Buddhist gods.&rdquo; The other main category were those properties that were not fully owned by the monastery, but nonetheless committed to service and donation. These were the &ldquo;lay communities&rdquo; (<span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">mid&eacute;</span>,&nbsp;<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">mi sde</span></em>) which meant &ldquo;communities in service of men.&rdquo; The key difference is that the monastery was fully in charge of the economic and political administration of the &ldquo;divine communities,&rdquo; while the &ldquo;lay communities&rdquo; were under the jurisdiction of lay lords (<span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">p&ouml;npo</span>,&nbsp;<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">dpon po</span></em>). The <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15472\">Labrang</span> Monastery estate was made up primarily of &ldquo;divine communities,&rdquo; with few &ldquo;lay communities.&rdquo; The &ldquo;divine&rdquo; and &ldquo;lay&rdquo; status were moreover subject to change. As time went on, other communities formed even looser, strictly donative relationships to the monastery, sometimes called &ldquo;religious communities&rdquo; (<span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ch&ouml;d&eacute;</span>,&nbsp;<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">chos sde</span></em>). The &ldquo;divine&rdquo; and &ldquo;lay&rdquo; communities were generally in the <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15348\">Amdo</span> region, contiguous to the monastery site. However, other communities far away from the monastery maintained strong ties, and were counted as monastery properties. These included communities in Heilongjiang, at Wutaishan, and in Inner Mongolia. Readers should note that the support relationships between <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15472\">Labrang</span> Monastery and its estates were largely dissolved beginning in 1958 and shortly thereafter; however, much reduced religious and donative relationships remain.</p>\n"},{"title":"The Eight Divine Communities","index":5,"parent_index":0,"body":"\n<p>The <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15472\">Labrang</span> Monastery and its extended community describes itself as consisting of &ldquo;eight divine communities&rdquo; (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">lha sde shog pa brgyad</span></em>). In general, these eight communities were the monastery&rsquo;s revenue generating properties in areas surrounding the monastery proper (some quite distant geographically), and their lay inhabitants were responsible for providing corv&eacute;e. The revenues were variable and quite different in each territory, and there were even differences within single territories. In addition, the borders of the territories and their names sometimes shifted over time, because of conquests, natural disasters, or migrations. There are also exceptions to the responsibility to provide corv&eacute;e (obligatory, unpaid labor for the monastery)&mdash;not all residents provided corv&eacute;e&mdash;and there were different kinds of such service. Still, in spite of the variations, there are definable territories and discernable patterns of revenue and corv&eacute;e.</p>\n<p>Each of the territories has its own history, from their inclusion in the &ldquo;eight divine communities,&rdquo; through their histories and through variations in commitments to different <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15472\">Labrang</span> corporate estates (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">nang chen</span></em>, <em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">bla brang</span></em>). It is notable that the <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15472\">Labrang</span> communities, their revenues and corv&eacute;e were treated like commodities. That is, they were inherently valuable, they were sometimes traded by different estate owners, and their commitments changed because of shifting allegiances on the part of the population.</p>\n<p>Here, the &ldquo;eight divine properties&rdquo; are listed, leaving the important matters of revenue, corv&eacute;e, and history aside, for the moment. Geographically, these communities extend from the actual site of the monastery in <span class=\"place\" title=\"F1147\">Sangchu</span>/Xiahe (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"F1147\">bsang chu</span></em>) County, north into Yatse/Xunhua, south to <span class=\"place\" title=\"F1075\">Ngawa</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"F1075\">rnga ba</span></em>) in the north of modern Sichuan Province, east to modern Ts&ouml;/Hezuo, and west over the modern Qinghai border through the Mongol territories of Prince Erdeni.</p>\n<p>1. The first of the eight is the collected the &ldquo;four divine communities (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">lha sde shog pa bzhi</span></em>).&rdquo; This was the original endowment donated by Genkya nomads, a summer pasture called Tokti Demo Tang, in the region known as Khagya tsodruk. The Mongol Prince Erdeni invited the First <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Jamyang Zhepa</span>, sponsored the construction of the earliest monastery buildings, and provided boys as novice monks and for eventual ordination.</p>\n<p>The &ldquo;four divine communities&rdquo; are <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Tanak</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">mtha&rsquo; nag</span></em>), <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Tawa Gongma</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">mtha&rsquo; ba gong ma</span></em>),&nbsp; <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Tawa Zh&ouml;lma</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">mtha&rsquo; ba zhol ma</span></em>) or <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Zayainang</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">za ya&rsquo;i nang</span></em>), and <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Sakar</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">sa dkar</span></em>). These four originally nomadic communities divided into thirteen farming villages (note that some of the following thirteen villages retain the name of the original large group). The account given here is compiled from several oral sources and verified where possible by written documents. The thirteen still recognize their origins in the four groups, as follows.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Group one (<span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Tanak</span>): 1. <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Zay&uuml;</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">za yus</span></em>), 2-3. <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Tangnak Gongzh&ouml;l</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">thang nag gong zhol</span></em>) (two villages), 4. <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Ng&ouml;nchok</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">sngon mchog</span></em>); </li>\n<li>Group two (<span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Tawa Gongma</span> ): 5-6. <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Tawa&nbsp; Gongzh&ouml;l&nbsp;</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">mtha&rsquo; ba gong zhol</span></em>) (two villages), 7. <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Menkhar</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">man mkhar</span></em>), 8. <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Sasoma</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">sa so ma</span></em>); </li>\n<li>Group three (<span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Tawa Zh&ouml;lma</span>): 9. <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Sakar</span>, 10. <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Gyawornang</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">rgya bor nang</span></em>), 11. <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pukd&eacute;</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">phug sde</span></em>); </li>\n<li>Group four: (The first of group four are today six small villages.
