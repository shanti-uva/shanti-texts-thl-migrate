Here, the focus is on the structures of the <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15472\">Labrang<\/span> Monastery\u2019s support communities, made up of predominantly nomadic and semi-nomadic groups in the surrounding areas. At the outset it is important to remember that the nomad society had different values, economies, and lifestyles than those of nearby lowland agricultural and predominantly sedentary societies. Agricultural communities had their locally defined authority structures, also with similar evolutions, for example from small subsistence level communities, to larger villages, and eventually regional groups. In nomadic areas like the <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15472\">Labrang<\/span> properties, its community-at-large, ownership of land, monetary and currency exchange, law and enforcement, and all social processes were all very different from those of surrounding cultures, and even more different from those in the modern west.<\/p>"},{"title":"Community Divisions","index":2,"parent_index":0,"body":"<p>Nomadic areas were characterized by small groups called \u201c<span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">tsowa<\/span>\u201d (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">tsho ba<\/span><\/em>) led by chiefs, or prominent men who were able to establish themselves by their strength, leadership qualities, skill, and intelligence. The small groups might be understood as tribes, extended clan groups, and combinations of clan groups with leaders who received recognition and offerings of goods from the community in gestures of privilege, legitimization, and loyalty. The group also made offerings to <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15472\">Labrang<\/span> or one of its branch monasteries, and sent young boys to the monastery for ordination. Again, these <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">tsowa<\/span>\u00a0groups included extended clans, but often included persons not biologically related.<\/p><p>The second stage of community authority structures were combined <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">tsowa<\/span> \u00a0groups, often called <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">shokpa<\/span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\">shog pa<\/span><\/em>) \u2013 literally \u201csection\u201d or \u201cwing.\u201d The leaders of these combined <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">shokpa<\/span> groups were tribal or collected clan chiefs who were able to extend their power over a larger area and greater number of people, beyond the borders of their home group. This larger group leadership status was a result of bravery in battle against common enemies, of community consensus, sometimes reinforced by marriage alliances, natural leadership skills, or as a result of mutual economic benefit. This level of community authority required inter-group diplomacy and negotiation, over matters of pasture, and other concerns appropriate to <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15348\">Amdo<\/span> (<span class=\"place\" title=\"F15348\"><em>a mdo<\/em><\/span>) highlands life.<\/p><p>The third level of community authority structure consisted of combinations of these <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">shokpa<\/span> groups.

In addition, <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15472\">Labrang<\/span>\u2019s value system, or its sense of identity was also defined in unique ways, very much in contrast to those of its close neighbors, the Chinese and the regional Muslim groups. There were variable value systems in the <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15348\">Amdo<\/span> region. The largest group were the nomadic Tibetans (and the regional Mongol nomad groups who assimilated Tibetan systems), with their constellations of Buddhist and regional religions. The local groups of Hui and Salar Muslims were distinct because of Islam, and their own community traditions, mostly agricultural, mercantile, and to a lesser extent highland nomadic. By far the most different ethnographic definitions in relation to the nomadic Tibetans in the greater <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15348\">Amdo<\/span> region were those of the neighboring Chinese. Regional Chinese groups defined their civilization in Confucian terms, by their unique language and culture, their dynastic heritage, their largely agricultural heritage, and in a few words, their fundamental values.<\/p><p>In contrast to the Chinese and Muslims, the <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15472\">Labrang<\/span> Tibetans identified themselves as Buddhists, heirs to the traditions of the ancient Tibetan empire, the well known sagas of Gesar, and for those connected to <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15472\">Labrang<\/span> the proud bearers of central Tibetan Buddhist traditions. The <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15472\">Labrang<\/span> Tibetans\u2019 nomadic lifestyles, their community group structures, their collected religious values and <span class=\"place\" title=\"F637\">Lhasa<\/span>-related heritage, and their vision of the world set them apart from their neighbors. The close proximity of these distinctly different groups stimulated even stronger assertion of personal and local community identity. These factors together provided powerful incentives for community solidarity. That is, maintaining one\u2019s personal and community commitment to <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15472\">Labrang<\/span> Monastery, paying taxes, providing corv\u00e9e, and participating in community rituals provided collective identity and strength, both metaphysical and in times of crisis, militia protection.<\/p><p>The important requirements of membership in the <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15472\">Labrang<\/span> communities included a knowledge of local Tibetan language, sensitivity to the very diverse range of religious values, acceptance of the authority of the monastery and the monastic authorities, and acceptance of one\u2019s personal and community commitment to the monastery. There were law codes, and punishment for severe transgressions, but in general petty law enforcement was a local community matter. Community members were required to observe community standards and accepted practices, but failure to pay taxes or to provide corv\u00e9e were not punishable offences; such transgressions rather resulted is disassociation of the group from the larger community, or in individual cases, banishment. Inability to pay often resulted in reduced or deferred payment. In some cases corv\u00e9e responsibility and sponsorship of religious events could be met by proxy. In sum, there was a broad range of tangible and intangible or religious incentives for membership in the <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15472\">Labrang<\/span> <em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">labrang<\/span><\/em>.<\/p>"},{"title":"Revenue Generating Properties","index":4,"parent_index":0,"body":"<p><span class=\"place\" title=\"F15472\">Labrang<\/span> Monastery\u2019s revenue generating properties, its \u201ccorporate estate\u201d or in Tibetan, its <em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">labrang<\/span>\u00a0<\/em>(<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">bla brang<\/span><\/em>) included the site of monastery itself and all of its properties.

In general, these eight communities were the monastery\u2019s revenue generating properties in areas surrounding the monastery proper (some quite distant geographically), and their lay inhabitants were responsible for providing corv\u00e9e. The revenues were variable and quite different in each territory, and there were even differences within single territories. In addition, the borders of the territories and their names sometimes shifted over time, because of conquests, natural disasters, or migrations. There are also exceptions to the responsibility to provide corv\u00e9e (obligatory, unpaid labor for the monastery)\u2014not all residents provided corv\u00e9e\u2014and there were different kinds of such service. Still, in spite of the variations, there are definable territories and discernable patterns of revenue and corv\u00e9e.<\/p><p>Each of the territories has its own history, from their inclusion in the \u201ceight divine communities,\u201d through their histories and through variations in commitments to different <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15472\">Labrang<\/span> corporate estates (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">nang chen<\/span><\/em>, <em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">bla brang<\/span><\/em>).
