The early kings of <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Deg&eacute;</span> founded the monastery in 1665 and appointed the lama <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">K&uuml;nzang Sherap</span><strong> </strong>(<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">kun bzang shes rab</span></em>,1636-1699)<strong> </strong>to lead the monastery. The monastery has not been as consistently important to the sect and region as <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dzokchen</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">rdzogs chen</span></em>) and <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Katok</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">kaHtog</span></em>) but in the early twentieth century its publication and scholastic output was quite remarkable. The present-day monastery thrives despite the current political conditions, and the large <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pely&uuml;l</span> Monastery in southern India is arguably the most important <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Nyingma</span> monastery in exile.<em>&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>The region of <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pely&uuml;l</span> is in the southernmost part of the kingdom of <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Deg&eacute;</span>, which was founded in the late 1630s. It appears that for a few decades <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pely&uuml;l</span> and its neighbors violently resisted incorporation into the new kingdom. <em><span class=\"tibtext\" title=\"Type ID here\">The Royal Genealogies of Deg&eacute;</span></em> (1828) describes the action taken against <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pely&uuml;l</span> and its neighbor <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Garj&eacute;</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">sga rje</span></em>) as follows: &ldquo;The golden wheel of forceful action utterly abolished the cruel behavior of the barbaric people of the lower territories such as <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Garj&eacute;</span> and <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pely&uuml;l</span>, and once again interned them within the vajra-enclosure of the law.&rdquo;<a name=\"n1\" href=\"#fn1\">[1]</a> In the aftermath of the quelled rebellion the state founded a new monastery at <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Namgyelts&eacute;</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">rnam rgyal rtse</span></em>) that was meant to be a replacement for the many religious institutions they destroyed. A recent history says that at its opening 500 monks were associated with the new monastery. Its proper name was <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pely&uuml;l Namgyel Jangchup Ch&ouml;ling</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">dpal yul rnam rgyal byang chub chos gling</span></em>). The <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Deg&eacute;</span> king behind this effort was named <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Sanggy&eacute; Tenpa</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">sangs rgyas bstan pa</span></em>; r. late seventeenth century), and his interest in the <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Nyingma</span> sect is also seen in his founding of <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dzokchen</span> Monastery and appointment of lamas at <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Katok</span> Monastery.</p>\n<p><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Deg&eacute;</span> originally wished for the elderly lama <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Serlo T&ouml;npa Gyentsen</span> (<span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Serlo T&ouml;npa Gyeltsen</span> in Central Tibetan Dialect;&nbsp;<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">gser lo ston pa rgyal mtshan</span></em>) to be the leader of the new <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pely&uuml;l</span> Monastery but he declined the offer because of his age. <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Serlo</span> and other lamas instead proposed that the position be given to <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Serlo</span>&rsquo;s&nbsp;student <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">K&uuml;nzang Sherap</span>. The young and popular visionary <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Mingyur Dorj&eacute;</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">mi 'gyur rdo rje</span></em>; 1645-1667) &ndash; discoverer of the <span class=\"tibtext\" title=\"Type ID here\">Namch&ouml;</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">gnam chos</span></em>), or <span class=\"tibtext\" title=\"Type ID here\">Sky Dharma</span>, treasures &ndash; also supported the decision and gave <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">K&uuml;nzang Sherap</span> a special series of teachings to prepare him to lead the monastery. It should also be noted that <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">K&uuml;nzang Sherap</span> was a fully ordained monk, which was not very common for <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Nyingma</span> lamas at the time. <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">K&uuml;nzang Sherap</span> died in 1699 at the age of sixty-five.</p>\n<p><span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Akham Lhamo</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">a kham lha mo</span></em>) joined her brother <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">K&uuml;nzang Sherap</span> at the new monastery. She was a lama in her own right and attracted many female disciples. <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Akham</span> organized her community into a nunnery and because of the large number of female renunciants in red robes at the site the place was called \"the hilltop of the red village\" (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">grong dmar steng</span></em>). The nunnery is still active at <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pely&uuml;l</span> in <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kham</span> and the <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pely&uuml;l Nunnery</span> in <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">India</span> has perhaps the best <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Nyingma</span> seminary for nuns in the exile community. In 1987 the contemporary head of <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pely&uuml;l Monastery</span> recognized an American woman in <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Washington, D.C.</span>, as the reincarnation of <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">&ldquo;Akh&ouml;n&rdquo; Lhamo</span> and she teaches at a <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pely&uuml;l</span> branch temple in <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Maryland</span>.</p>\n<p><span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">K&uuml;nzang Sherap</span> is counted as the first chief abbot of <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pely&uuml;l</span> and his disciple <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Lh&uuml;ndrup Gyatso</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">lhun grub rgya mtsho</span></em>; 1659/69-1727) as the second. The third in the abbatial line was <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pema Norbu</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">pad+ma nor bu</span></em>; 1679-1757). This lama is also counted as the first of the famous <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Penor Rinpoch&eacute;</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">pad nor rin po che</span></em>) reincarnate lamas. During the first<span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\"> Pema Norbu</span>&rsquo;s latter decades the great polymath <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Situ Penchen</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">si tu pan chen</span></em>, 1699-1774) was the greatest lama in all of <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Deg&eacute;</span>. <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Situ Penchen</span> was personally committed to increasing the number of <em>ordained</em> monks at <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Nyingma</span> monasteries in <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Deg&eacute;</span> and had a large impact on <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pely&uuml;l</span> in particuar. In the early summer of 1740 <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Situ Penchen</span> visited <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pely&uuml;l</span> and met with <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pema Norbu</span>. Later that summer <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Situ</span>&rsquo;s&nbsp;home monastery of <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pelpung</span> celebrated the <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Padmasambhava</span> festival (the Tsechu; <em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">tshes bcu</span></em>) and <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Situ</span>&rsquo;s <em><span class=\"tibtext\" title=\"Type ID here\">Autobiography</span></em> records him giving full ordination to 300 monks from <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pely&uuml;l</span> and <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Rakchap</span>&nbsp;(<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">rag chab</span></em>) Monasteries; the latter monastery being another <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Nyingma</span> monastery in southern <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Deg&eacute;</span>. <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Situ</span> again visited <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pely&uuml;l</span> in 1741 and 1743. In 1750 some <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pely&uuml;l</span> monks traveled to <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pelpung</span> for full ordination, and later that same year <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Situ</span> again visited <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pely&uuml;l</span> to give ordination. All of this took place during <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pema Norbu</span>&rsquo;s tenure.</p>\n<p>The fourth chief abbot at <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pely&uuml;l</span> was <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Karma Trashi</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">kar+ma bkra shis</span></em>; d. 1790). He too was an associate of <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Situ Penchen</span> and the latter&rsquo;s <em><span class=\"tibtext\" title=\"Type ID here\">Autobiography</span></em> mentions several meetings between the two lamas. At least three actions stand out from <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Karma Trashi</span>&rsquo;s career. Firstly, he built a new retreat center at <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pely&uuml;l</span> called the <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Lower Retreat</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">sgrub khang 'og ma</span></em>). Secondly, <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Karma Trashi</span> was an adherent of the late eighteenth-century treasure tradition the <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Longchen Nyingtik</span>&nbsp;(<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">klong chen snying thig</span></em>), and established its practice at <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pely&uuml;l</span>. Around this time the <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Longchen Nyingtik&nbsp;</span>was embraced by many high-ranking lamas in <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Deg&eacute;</span> and became one of the main instruction lineages of <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dzokchen</span>. Thirdly, <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Karma Trashi</span> had an effect on <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pely&uuml;l</span> through his support for the Qing army&rsquo;s second &ldquo;Jinchuan campaign&rdquo;&nbsp;(its war against two kingdoms in <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Gyelrong</span> &ndash;&nbsp;<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">rgyal rong</span></em><em>,</em> and local <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">B&ouml;npos</span>). <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Karma Trashi</span> provided prayers and amulets for the Chinese and Tibetan troops fighting for the Qing and after the <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Gyelrong</span> people were defeated and their <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">B&ouml;n</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">bon</span></em>) monasteries converted to <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Geluk</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">dge lugs</span></em>) establishments, the Qing rewarded him with titles, seals, and silver; which doubtlessly was used to benefit <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pely&uuml;l</span>. <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Karma Trashi</span> died in 1790 at the age of 63.</p>\n<p>A century later the so-called Ecumenical or <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Rim&eacute;</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ris med</span></em>) movement &ndash; centered at <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Situ Penchen</span>&rsquo;s <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pelpung</span> Monastery and <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dzongsar</span> Monastery &ndash; attracted all major <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Deg&eacute;</span> monasteries into its orbit. The seventh chief abbot of <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pely&uuml;l</span>, <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pema Dongak Tendzin</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">pad+ma mdo sngags bstan 'dzin</span></em>, 1830-1892), was a disciple of the main <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Rim&eacute;</span> lamas and was inspired to contribute to their efforts towards the compilation, editing, and publication of rare corpora of religious literature. Towards the end of the nineteenth century <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pema Dongak Tendzin</span> began to compile an edition of the <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Nyingma</span> <span class=\"tibtext\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kama</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">bka' ma</span></em>), a collection of liturgies, contemplative manuals, and scholastic commentaries on the three inner tantras. In the mid-nineteenth century lamas at <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dzokchen</span> Monastery had made efforts to compile and disseminate an edition of the <span class=\"tibtext\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kama</span> and the <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pely&uuml;l</span> edition was intended to be an enlargement upon theirs. It is reported that <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pely&uuml;l</span> housed three separate printeries, with woodblocks for around fifty volumes. <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pema Dongak Tendzin</span> also built a new large temple at <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pely&uuml;l</span> and newly established many complex religious festivals involving a wide range of ritual arts and dance. <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pely&uuml;l</span> had eighteen individual temples and an additional four chapels for protector deities. By this time in its history <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pely&uuml;l</span> lamas had established branch monasteries in several areas of <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kham</span> and beyond, including <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Serta </span>(<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">gser rta</span></em>),\n<script src=\"../../../../../javascripts/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js?1274928360\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\n<span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Gonjo</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">go &rsquo;jo</span></em>), <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Drango</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">brag &rsquo;go</span></em>), <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Golok</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">mgo log</span></em>), and <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Gyelrong</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">rgyal rong</span></em>).</p>\n<p>The eighth chief abbot of <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pely&uuml;l</span>, <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dongak Ch&ouml;kyi Nyima</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">mdo sngags chos kyi nyi ma</span></em>; 1854-1906), continued the efforts of his predecessor and completed the publication of the <span class=\"tibtext\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kama</span>. The <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pely&uuml;l</span> edition contained 20 volumes and was used as the basis for the 58-volume expanded edition published by <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dudjom Rinpoch&eacute; </span>in exile in the late 1960s. <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dongak Ch&ouml;kyi Nyima</span> also combined <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pely&uuml;l</span>&rsquo;s&nbsp;two retreat centers into a community of twenty-five retreatants. Furthermore, he also founded the large and important branch monastery of <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dartang</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">dar thang</span></em>) in <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Golok</span>. The ninth abbot <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pelchen D&uuml;pa</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">dpal chen 'dus pa</span></em>; 1887-1932) was another major figure at <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pely&uuml;l</span>. He was certainly a product of the <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Rim&eacute;</span> movement, but was also influenced by the early twentieth century rise in scholastic learning that swept through <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kham</span> at the time. In 1921 he opened a seminary at <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pely&uuml;l</span> and its ceremonial first abbot was none other than the founder of contemporary <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Nyingma</span> scholasticism <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Mipam Chokl&eacute; Namgyel</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">mi pham phyogs las rnam rgyal</span></em>; 1846-1912). The seminary was called Jeweled Mountain of Study and Reflection (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">thos bsam nor bu'i lhun po</span></em>) and for the first few decades the seminary had fifty monks. It was destroyed in 1958 and rebuilt after the Cultural Revolution.</p>\n<p>The third <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Penor Rinpoch&eacute;</span> &ndash; <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Leksh&eacute; Ch&ouml;kyi Drayang</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">legs bshad chos kyi sgra dbyangs</span></em>; 1932-2009) &ndash; fled into exile in India in the late 1950s and in 1961 took up residence on a tract of land in the jungles of <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Karnataka</span> state in southern India that had been given to the Tibetan refugees to clear and settle. In 1963 <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Penor Rinpoch&eacute;</span> formally reestablished <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pely&uuml;l</span> Monastery at this settlement (in <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Bylakuppe</span>) and over the decades tirelessly and with great ingenuity grew the initially very humble community into the largest <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Nyingma</span> monastery in exile. <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Penor Rinpoch&eacute; </span>emphasized scholastics and the excellent seminary at <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pely&uuml;l</span> in <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">India</span> produced an entire generation of teachers who taught Buddhist doctrine at <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Nyingma</span> monasteries in South Asia for all of the 1980s, 1990s, and beyond. <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Penor Rinpoch&eacute;</span> was also a driving force behind the rebuilding of the <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pely&uuml;l</span> Monastery in <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kham</span> after the Maoist period. Today it has large temples, vigorous study and retreat programs, and a nunnery with over one hundred nuns.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<hr size=\"1\" />\n<p><a name=\"fn1\" href=\"#n1\">[1]</a> P. 38, <em>&nbsp;</em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\"><em>las shugs gser gyi 'khor los sa smad kyi/ sga (mi bsrun pa'i sde) dpal la sogs dmu rgod 'gro ba rnams/ brlang spyod rmeg med bcil nas slar yang ni/ bka' khrims rdo rje'i ra bar 'da' med bcug/</em><em>&nbsp;</em></span><em>&nbsp;</em></p>","title":"Pelyül Monastery"}]}
