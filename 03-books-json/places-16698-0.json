This pillar stands just several hundred meters from the shore of the lake in the middle of a seasonal encampment. To the south rises a small hill but in other directions there is a wide open panorama. The a ’ong mtsho basin is less degraded and more heavily used by <span class=\"popular emph\">drok pa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">’brog pa</span> than the ‘Valley of the Dead’, which is situated immediately to the south (see C-91, C-92, C-153, D-46, D-68). The environmentally more conducive conditions found in the a ’ong mtsho basin may help to explain why it appears to have hosted far fewer funerary monuments than the neighboring basin. </p>
