In most\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tplaces this wall is just a heaped line of loose stones circumscribing the steep slope. Approximately 10 m above\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe walkway there is another cubic tomb (2 m x 1.9 m) (58.984&#900; / 51.104&#900; / 50 30 m). The maximum height of its\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdownhill side is 1.2 m and that of its uphill side, 50 cm.

A 1.1-m deep oval-shaped depression (3.3 m x 2.5 m) is found 20 m to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsouth of this cubic tomb. It appears to have an in situ corbel resting on its upslope rim. The function of this\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstructure is unknown. If there were analogous structures in the vicinity, they have been reabsorbed into the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttalus slopes. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The walled path continues around to the north side of the mountain and disappears some meters below the summit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbove this upper length of the trail there is another cubic tomb (59.019&#900; / 51.074&#900; / 5050 m). It is 2 m in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlength and up to 1 m in height. Its downhill side has been destroyed. At the same elevation, in close proximity,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthere is a walled level area. Above the cubic tomb there are two more walled terraces, interconnected by a wall.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThese walls, now nothing more than heaps of stones, are up to 80 cm high on their downhill sides. The level\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tareas enclosed within measure around 3 m x 6 m. The function of these pads or terraces is enigmatic. Perhaps\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthey were used as camping areas for those who built the tombs and conducted the burial rites. On the other hand,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthey may have had a ritual purpose. On the north side of the <span class=\"popular\">Endrits&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">An &rsquo;bri rtse</span>mountain just below the summit, there are two more similarly-sized and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconstructed walled pads (58.985&#900; / 51.042&#900; / 5090 m). There is another walled pad, 5 m higher in elevation and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tyet another 2 m above it, both of which are of similar size and dimensions. The forward walls of these four\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tenclosures are flush with or only slightly elevated above the downhill slope, probably as a of result\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdisintegration.

From this high point, the summit ridge drops in elevation\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttowards the southwest. What appears to be the base of a cubic tomb is located on the narrow summit ridge\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(58.939&#900; / 50.984&#900; / 5090 m). Beyond this point, the summit ridge narrows to less than 1 m in width in places\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twith sheer drops on both sides. The summit ridge then widens again in the proximity of the base of another cubic\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttomb (58.871&#900; / 50.908&#900; / 5050 m).

In between them and the aforementioned specimen (at 5050 m), there is the probable base of a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcubic tomb but the remains are too dissolute for a positive identification. The group of three tombs (5040 m) is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpartially interconnected by walls running between them. The highest specimen (Funerary structure FS1) in this\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgroup (1.8 m x 1.8 m x 1 m [height]) is situated on the ridge-top. A much more poorly preserved specimen\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(Funerary structure FS2) is located 4.5 m away, on the summit. From this second cubic tomb, a wall (24 m long,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tup to 1 m high) extends to the third specimen and then somewhat beyond it. A 6-m long wall also extends from FS1\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin the direction of funerary structure FS3 (this wall was originally somewhat longer). These two interconnecting\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\theaped-stone walls do not actually contact the tombs but run in close proximity to them. These walls enclose a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsmall hollow in the ridge-top, in which the third tomb (FS3) of the group is located. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Funerary structure FS3, among the best preserved at <span class=\"popular\">Endrits&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">An &rsquo;bri rtse</span>, measures 2.5 m x 2 m x 1.3 m, but it must have been somewhat taller when constructed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFortunately, its rectangular central depository is intact (1 m x 60 cm x 50 cm). Stone courses lining this\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tchamber taper inwards so that its top only measures 40 cm x 40 cm. The central depository could have been easily\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcapped by a single stone. A good deal of the outer structure of the tomb not only surrounds the central\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdepository but rises above it, creating a substantial encasement. A sodden piece of what ostensibly was part of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ta human skull and another piece of bone were discovered in the snow-covered central depository. When subjected\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto chronometric testing, the skull fragment (about the size of a silver dollar) yielded disappointing results.<a href=\"#n82\" name=\"nb82\" class=\"note\">82</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Continuing down the ridgeback there is a zone of isolated walls of the same design and construction.
