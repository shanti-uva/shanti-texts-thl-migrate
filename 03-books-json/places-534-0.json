In 1647, it came under the direct control of the Manchu government. In 1751, it came to be ruled by the Manchu officials resident in Tibet and in 1916, control was handed over to the Tibetan government. In 1959 sTeng chen rdzong was established and absorbed into Chab mdo region. At one point in history it was called Sum pa glang gi gyim shod, a territory of Zhang zhung sgo pa, which was one of the three provinces of Zhang zhung called sGo, Phug and Bar.</p> <p>The story of the Khyung lineage begins with three brothers: lHa lung rgyal, Khyung Thog la ’bar, and dMu khyung rgyal. Around the 10th century, Shes rab rgyal mtshan, of the dMu khyung lineage, migrated to Sum pa glang. As the Khyung lineage prospered there, the place came to be known as Khyung po.</p> "},{"title":"(35) sTeng chen Monastery","index":3,"parent_index":2,"body":" <p>The monastery’s full name is sTeng chen dgon gYung drung bstan rgyas gling. sTeng chen Monastery comes under the administration of the municipality of sTeng chen and is situated on the hillside to the west of the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">rdzong. </span>It was founded in 1061 by Khyung dbus Shes rab rgyal mtshan.</p> <p>The story of the Khyung lineage is told as follows: A long time ago, a big Garuda (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">khyung</span>) flew into a flower garden and there it produced three crystal-like eggs, from each of which appeared a very beautiful boy. The eldest was called lHa khyung, the second Thog la ’bar and the youngest dMu khyung rgyal. The latter had two sons and a daughter, sTag sgra dun gtsug, dPal gyi gir ti and Khyung bza’ Ye shes mtsho rgyal. The daughter, Khyung bza’, married Lig mi rgyal, the king of Zhang zhung. Her elder brother, sTag sgra dun gtsug, flourished in sTeng chen. He had a son called Gyer nam zur rtse, who had two sons, sTong rgyung rin mo and sTag la skyes. The former had three sons, Khyung sgom mu langs, Khyung ’phags khra mo and Khyung sder sngon mo. Khyung sgom mu langs’s son was Khu byug, and his three sons were sTag pa, Zur dkar ba and mDo bkra ba. sTag pa’s son was Myes tshab, and he had four sons, sTon pa ’bar, Dam pa Khyung sgom (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">alias</span> Shes rab sgom), dBen pa ma lugs (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">alias</span> sTon lug), and Dam pa Khyung dbus (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">alias</span> Dad pa rgyal mtshan). sTon pa ’bar’s son was sTon thar, and he had six sons, sTon sras, Shes rab rgyal mtshan, sTon mnyan Dam pa bang bkra, dPon dge, dPon dbus and sTon ’bum. The mother of these six was a rGya lady, so they came to be known as “The Six rGya tsha Brothers” (rGya tsha spun drug). Of the six brothers, Khyung dbus Shes rab rgyal mtshan was guided by a prophecy as follows:</p> <p>“The one who holds the lineage of dBra dkar Khyung po</p> <p>Must go to mDo khams smad.</p> <p>The doctrine rises and falls like the sun and the moon,</p> <p>Even if they fall tonight, they would shine tomorrow.</p> <p>At the bottom of Sum glang lies rNgu rdzong,</p> <p>In front of the six magnificent fortresses of crystal.</p> <p>sTeng chen is situated like the gold fish in a lake,</p> <p>There is the site for a seat of the Khyung family.</p> <p>Now go towards that site.</p> <p>The river of knowledge will wind there,</p> <p>And the flag of the Khyung lineage will be stable there.”</p> <p>When Khyung dbus arrived in sTeng chen there was a Chinese man there called gTsug gtor nyi ma ’brug grags (hereafter, Nyi ma ’brug grags). He was a man both powerful and learned. He realized that the time had come and that his was a suitable place to welcome Khyung dbus.</p> <p>At that time, Khyung dbus was travelling in the places called Khri, rDo, rMa and La. Nyi ma ’brug grags constructed a throne at Khyung khri thang in rMa and gave a reception for the lama. Then the lama was invited to go to a fortress called Khams gsum dbang ’dus. From there he proceeded to sTeng chen, which he thought corresponded to the description in the prophecy. The lama first founded two colleges called Kun khyab gling and bsTan rgyas gling. The first one was for practising meditation according to Sutra and the second according to Tantra. bsTan rgyas gling produced a series of eminent monks and Kun khyab gling had tantric practitioners such as Tha yud wer zhi and the eighteen masters in the Do khung line, who were all tantrists with long locks.</p> <p>Nyi ma ’brug grags then offered his adherence to Khyung dbus by telling him:</p> <p>“I have my own Chinese culture in China.</p> <p>I must return to my own country.</p> <p>I offer you this seat of mine as your abode.</p> <p>And this large field for which I paid a bowlful of gold,</p> <p>As a seat for yourself, king of Khyung.</p> <p>The plateau up there,</p> <p>Is the place where I play the gold dice.</p> <p>Make it your royal seat, you, the king. </p> <p>Below the junction of the three gSer ru valleys,</p> <p>Above the confluence of the two rivers,</p> <p>This is the land I, the old China man, bought.</p> <p>Make it your royal seat, you, the king. </p> <p>The red rock, which is like a fortress of fire (down there),</p> <p>Is like a Garuda lying in its nest.</p> <p>Make it your royal seat, you, the king. </p> <p>It is there where you should build your fortress and palace…”</p> <p>And he added,</p> <p>“The spring of water in rDza dkar so ma,</p> <p>Is the place for your horse to drink.</p> <p>All this is given to you, please accept them.”</p> <p>Khyung dbus replied: “I am simply a monk who has abandoned the family life, so I would not know how to manage a fortress and be a leader of a community. If you mean to give your land and fortress to the Khyung family, my brother’s sons A brla and Nang chen grags pa are at Khyung lung in Zhang zhung. I hope you will be able to send two messengers with a present from me to go to Khyung lung.</p> <p>Then Khyung dbus, as a sign of assurance, gave a dagger with a white haft to the messengers dispatched by Nyi ma ’brug grags. They called on Khyung A brla, offered the present and told him why they came to see him. Khyung A brla consented to come to sTeng chen. He, with the two messengers, travelled by the southern road. They happily arrived in the land of Khyung po.</p> <p>Then Khyung dbus and Nyi ma ’brug grags met Khyung A brla. Nyi ma ’brug grags, having given all the land to Khyung A brla, went back to China accompanied by his own servants. Khyung dbus and all the people saw him off. Khyung dbus passed away on the shore of the river rNgul chu after exhibiting immense miraculous signs of his spiritual accomplishment.</p> <p>Later Nang chen grags pa paid a visit to China and had an audience with the emperor. Upon returning to sTeng chen, he fixed his residence at sTeng chen itself. Thereafter, sTeng chen’s spiritual and temporal laws became very famous. A brla continued working for the monastery and exhibited signs of spiritual accomplishment. He finally died at the age of sixty-two. He had many religious objects of body, speech and mind made.</p> <p>One of A brla’s four wives, ’Dan bza’, had three sons, Khyung zhig Ye rgyal ba, dBang rgyal grub and Byang nang pa Byang shes. Ye rgyal ba was an eminent monk. He practised meditation on Khro bo and Phur pa. Kindling his divine power, he reinforced his deeds for religious beings. He died at seventy. A brla’s son bSod nams rgyal mtshan by the lady of Rong was a very learned man. He possessed awe-inspiring dignity, convincing speech and foresight, and his reputation spread. He passed away when he was eighty-two. Drung chen Nam mkha’ rgyal mtshan, another son of A brla by Rong mo za, was a man with a broad knowledge of Bonpo scriptures. With the great power and skill obtained from constant meditation on Srid rgyal drel dmar, in particular, he laboured for sentient beings. At the age of seventy-two, he died in sTeng chen. From here the offspring of A brla were succeeded as the head of the monastery by a series of masters:</p> <ol type=\"1\"> <li> Rin chen rgyal mtshan dar</li> <li> gYung drung rgyal mtshan </li> <li> Rin chen rgyal mtshan</li> <li> bsTan pa’i rgyal mtshan</li> <li> Ye shes rgyal mtshan</li> <li> lHun grub bsod nams dbang rgyal</li> <li> dBang gi rgyal mtshan</li> <li> Yid bzhin rgyal ba</li> <li> rGyal ba don grub</li> <li> Khyung po Blo gros rgyal mtshan</li> <li> Blo ldan snying po (b.1360)</li> <li> Khyung chen Yon tan rin chen</li> <li> Khyung dkar</li> <li> Khyung po A ’je</li> <li> Khyung po rNam rgyal</li> <li> sPyang Be zhu Blo bzang</li> <li> sKyang ’phags Tshe dbang bstan rgyal</li> </ol> <p>Blo ldan snying po, the eleventh, was born of the dBra clan in the lower part of Khyung po. He received the Oral Tradition, which he wrote down, filling about fifty-four volumes, including the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">mDo Dri med gzi brjid</span>. He is said to have had a five-storey temple built, called bKra shis ’od ’bar. It had statues of deities of the forty-five vehicles, as well as the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">Khams chen nag phran ma</span> written in gold. He died at forty-seven.</p> <p>sKyang ’phags Tshe dbang bstan rgyal, the seventeenth, studied at gYung drung gling Monastery (No.2) and obtained the degree of <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">dge bshes</span> there. Having thoroughly mastered dozens of subjects, he received completely perfect teachings of texts and instructions from Lama rGyal mtshan in sTeng chen. At that time, gTer ston bDe chen gling pa arrived in sTeng chen. He visited the place called gTer sgrom kha and prophesied that there would be a monastery there. Since Tshe dbang bstan rgyal had been given the very same prophecy by sKyabs mgon Zla ba rgyal mtshan, Tshe dbang bstan rgyal fulfilled the prophecies of the two masters by uniting the two establishments, gYung drung bstan rgyal gling - the monastery of Khyung dkar lineage holders in the Upper sTeng chen - and the one called Kun khyab gling - which had been the abode of eighteen series of Khyung tantric practitioners - into one and moving them to gTer sgrom kha in 1862.</p> <p>The new monastery was large with a number of monks. It had over four hundred households to support it. Moreover, he had over a hundred temples built, of various sizes. These establishments followed a strict monastic tradition; assemblies were to be held fifteen times a year. The monastery had many important visitors, so it became known all over Tibet.</p> <p>Then, in sTeng chen Monastery, there was the accomplished scholar gYung grags pa (gYung drung Tshul khrims dbang grags), who had the whole <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">bKa’ ’gyur</span> and <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">bKa’ brten</span> copied to the best quality and made an excellent catalogue of the collection. After gYung grags pa, Khyung sprul Tshe dbang g-yung drung followed as the head of the monastery in 1913. During this time, China and Tibet were at war with each other which caused the monastery to be burnt down. However, Khyung ser sga sprul Tshe dbang g-yung drung took the initiative to rebuild it. A large and splendid temple was built, containing many religious objects. At that time, bsTan pa, having obtained the degree of <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">dge bshes</span> in metaphysics in gYung drung gling, returned to his native monastery. When Nyi ma dbang rgyal, the Thirty-first abbot of sMan ri Monastery (No.1), came to this monastery, the abbot appointed bsTan pa as head of the monastery. mKhan po bsTan pa had many religious objects made and did great deeds for sentient beings.</p> <p>Before 1959, there were about 180 monks in sTeng chen Monastery. At present there are sixty-one monks, led by the following: the abbot, rGya mtsho nor bu, who is thirty-three years old in 1998; the chanting conductors, ’Chi med g-yung drung and bsTan pa tshul khrims; and the disciplinarians, bSod nams bkra shis and sNying rje bstan ’dzin. There are, in fact, no more than fourteen who reside permanently in the monastery.</p> <p>As daily activities, in the morning the monks recite the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">rtsa rlung</span> prayer.

They also perform rituals for wrathful deities, gShed dmar, Khro bo and the propitiation of the religious protectors.</p> <p>The mountain behind the monastery is called Brag dmar ri ’dus, the abode of the local deity Rin chen ’bar ba, and at its left are those called gZi yar sku, Mar sku and Gong rgyal. In front of the monastery is the holy mountain known as Ri rtse drug.</p> <p>The monks’ main source of income is religious services in the neighbouring villages of Ye tha, which have a population of more than 3,200 farmers and nomads, in over 500 households. For these services the people customarily pay the monks from five to twenty <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">yuan</span> a day.</p> "},{"title":"(36) sTeng chen Hermitage","index":4,"parent_index":2,"body":" <p>This is a hermitage that lies to the east of sTeng chen Monastery, less than a stone’s throw away.</p> <p>The hermitage has a large temple of magnificent design.

From sTeng chen rdzong, travelling about twelve kilometres westward on the highway, we reach the village of Ra khrom. After crossing a small bridge, a walk of more than half an hour in a south-westerly direction leads us to the monastery. Situated on a hill and surrounded by a number of holy mountains, it lies to the east of the Four Great Sacred Places of Tibet, south of the Thang lha range, on the highland between the rivers rNgul chu and rDza chu, and near sTeng chen Monastery (No.35). It was the place where sPrul sku Blo ldan snying po received the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">mDo Dri med gzi brjid</span> as an oral tradition and wrote it down.</p> <p>The monastery was first supported by benefactors gSas sar Nam mka’ g-yung drung, the owner of the land, ’Be ru bon srung and sTag rtsa rGyal mtshan. The Shel masters played an important role in the monastery. The origin of the Shel lineage is as follows: long ago in China, there was a man called Kun dga’ ’od ’phro. He lived amidst flowers in an ocean that emitted lights. He miraculously produced a white crystal egg from which a little man appeared. He had turquoise hair and a white chin-tuft; he was dressed in white silk and was holding a lotus. He was found by the king of China, who called him Zing ba mthu chen. He became a prelate in the court and came to have the name Legs tang mang po. bSam gtan rgyal mtshan, one of his descendants, migrated to Tibet, where he subdued many gods and demons. He was followed by Khro bo rgyal mtshan and Zhig chung Nam mkha’ mtha’ bral.</p> <p>In 1454, Yag snya bSod nams rgyal mtshan founded the monastery at gYang ra brag rtsar. He named the monastery Ka legs gYung drung gling. He raised funds for the commemoration of the great master mNyam med Shes rab rgyal mtshan and made sure that the rituals he established in the monastery closely followed the teachings of the master. There were only seven monks, including the lama Tshe dbang rgyal mtshan of rDzogs mda’ and Tshul khrims. There was a complete set of religious objects and implements for making offerings, such as the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">gandi</span>, a drum, a stone gong and a conch. There was also the tradition of studying the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">tshad ma</span> logic.</p> <p>In 1564, reasons for moving the monastery to a new place arose. The old site was small and unsafe. So, in the time of lHun grub rgya mtsho, a discussion was held among all the laity and clergy and it was agreed that the monastery should be moved to Ka bzos sribs. It was therefore rebuilt and the religious objects of body, speech and mind were installed. Celebrations and the study of the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">tshad ma</span> logic were re-established. There were about twenty-five monks at that time and the monastery became known even among the people of Amdo and rGyal rong.</p> <p>There was a series of masters as the head of the monastery:</p> <ol type=\"1\"> <li> ’Gro mgon bsTan pa ’brug grags</li> <li> lHun grub bzhi</li> <li> gYung drung mi zhig rdo rje</li> <li> Yid bzhin rgyal ba tshul khrims</li> <li> bSod nams ye shes</li> <li> Tshul khrims rgyal mtshan</li> <li> Zla ba grags</li> <li> Phun tshogs rgyal mtshan</li> <li> bsTan ’dzin grags pa</li> <li> Nyi ma bstan rgyal </li> <li> gYung drung rgyal mtshan</li> </ol> <p>However, in 1914, the Tibetan troops led by the commander rTa nag (who were of dGe lugs pa obedience), came to the area and they began to murder many of the local people. They also completely burned the monastery. Phun tshogs bstan ’dzin grags pa (1888-1954) and his three disciples, Nyi ma grags pa, bsTan pa’i rgyal mtshan and gYung drung rgyal ba, could no longer live there. They left for Hor where there were benefactors of the Bon religion.</p> <p>The teacher Phun tshogs bstan ’dzin grags pa was a capable physician. He was able to cure illnesses of man and animal, and prevent epidemics.</p> <p>At that time, there was, in sTeng chen, the famous governor-general of Hor, Grags pa rnam rgyal. He assigned A drung to the restoration of the monastery and sent him to Hor in order to bring back the above-mentioned monks. The governor-general ordered the chief of dKar ru and his people to provide labour, as well as to transport the timber that was needed.</p> <p>In 1914, Phun tshogs bstan ’dzin grags pa himself laid the foundation of the main hall. He maintained the monastic tradition of sMan ri as was established by mNyam med Shes rab rgyal mtshan. He also established the study of the five minor and five major sciences, the summer and winter festivals for fifteen days each and the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">dgu gtor</span> rite based on Khro bo and Phur pa, as well as the chanting of the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">bKa’ skyong</span>.</p> <p>There were two gilt-bronze stupas in the form of gYung drung bkod legs and a statue of rNam rgyal as tall as a two-storey house.

At that time, there were more than seventy monks in the monastery.</p> <p>A reliquary gilt-bronze stupa of Phun tshogs bstan ’dzin grags pa (1888-1954) as tall as a two-storey house was made. </p> <p>A prayer for a quick birth of his reincarnation was offered, in consequence of which his reincarnation was born in 1956. In the process of searching for the reincarnation, Ka legs Monastery made offerings of twelve thousand sacrificial cakes (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">tshogs</span>) to the tutelary deity Phur pa and to the protective deities. It was known that the reincarnation himself said, “I am going to Ka legs”, and showed many miraculous signs, which were actually heard by the attendant monks. The father of the reincarnation, who was called Tshang stobs rgyal mtshan, belonged to the lineage in which Me ston Shes rab ’od zer in Yar ’brog was born and the mother belonged to the lineage of Zhig po. At that time there were about seventy monks in the monastery. Among them were Rin chen tshul khrims, bsTan pa rgyal mtshan, Ye shes dbang ldan and bZod pa mthar phyin, who were all very learned, having studied logic and Sanskrit, as well as being accomplished in meditation according to the Oral Tradition of Zhang zhung.</p> <p>In short, this monastery has experienced rises and falls in the course of its own history, but it had the capacity to produce a series of eminent monks who were able to uphold the Bon doctrine and it is one of the oldest and important Bonpo monasteries.</p> <p>The monastery is surrounded by the following sacred sites: Sa yi brag ri sgor mo, where the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">mDo Dri med gzi brjid </span>was written down<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"> </span>by Blo ldan snying po; Sa sho mda’, where there is the self-risen <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">Ma tri</span> mantra and swastika; bDe chen lha ri gnam rdzong; Chu na ma; and the holy mountain Dong rdzong smug po mched brgyad, regarded as the site blessed by Dran pa nam mkha’ and his son Tshe dbang rig ’dzin.

He was born in 1360 in Khyung po. From childhood he naturally displayed cleverness and dexterousness unlike other children. He quickly mastered writing and reading. He was such a miraculous one that he inspired awe and respect in the minds of the people at the first sight of him. He met the scholar Rin chen blo gros, and in his presence took monastic vows and was given the name dBra btsun Nam mkha’ rin chen. He became an eminent scholar versed in Sutra, Tantra and Mind.</p> <p>In a vision, he received an oral transmission, which he wrote down, filling fifty-five volumes. They are about the Bon doctrine and the deeds of sTon pa gShen rab, such as the following works on Sutra: <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">Dri med gzi brjid</span> in twelve volumes,<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"> mTshan mdo</span> in six volumes, <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">lHun po brtsegs mdo</span>, <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">bKra shis dal ’bar khab</span> and <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">Ma tri rin chen sgron ma</span>.

Having completed these deeds, Blo ldan snying po passed away.</p> <p>The reincarnation of Blo ldan snying po was Mi shig rdo rje, who produced fifteen volumes<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"> </span>of writings on Bon doctrines, including the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">sNyan brgyud zhi khro dgongs ’dus</span>.</p> <p>The Third Blo ldan snying po was Sangs rgyas gling pa, who greatly developed rTse drug Monastery. His benefactors were the chiefs of Khyung dkar, Khyung nag and Khyung ser in the Khyung po region. He was invited to go to rGyal rong by the king of dGe bshes. In rGyal rong he gave teachings to the people. When he was about to return to rTse drug Monastery, he was invited to the hall rNam rgyal khang bzang in the palace of the dGe bshe king. The king gave him the following gifts: an image of rGyal ba rgya mtsho that uttered words by itself, a pair of dragon-figured cymbals and a bronze gong named Khro chen dgu ’phar ma. The king also called on thirty young men to be ordained and become monks of rTse drug Monastery. The king of Brag steng gave Sangs rgyas gling pa the following gifts: thirty pairs of cymbals and thirty pairs of little flat bells of the Bon tradition. The king of Rab brtan gave him a large pair of cymbals named lHa mo rang grags and another called Srid pa rang grags, a large flat bell, canopies called rTa rgyugs ma and Khyung lnga ma, and the curtain called Seng thod ma. The Chinese emperors gave him large plaques (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">pan</span>), on which there were words in Chinese characters written in gold.</p> <p>Sangs rgyal gling pa, who was venerated by all, wrote many works, which are in two categories.

He gave up eating food, yet lived on at rTse drug for a long time. He established the hermitage of Gyim shod yang dben mthong grol near the monastery.</p> <p>In 1926, Nyag gter gSang sngags gling pa was invited to the monastery. He rediscovered various texts from the cave called Seng ge g-yu rtse and he established in the monastery the “religious dance of the 10th day” and the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">sman sgrub</span> ceremony. On this occasion there were over five hundred monks and nuns, a larger number of pilgrims, plus the local people all gathered together. The number of Bonpo pilgrims and spectators rose to nearly one hundred thousand.</p> <p>In 1934, Kun grol hum chen ’Gro ’dul gling pa was invited to the monastery.

In the sGrub grwa khang, seven lamas and monks practised the four stages of the tantric meditation while they learn other subjects. Likewise, the abbot and teacher gave lessons to more than fifteen monk students, on the first four of the “Five <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">mDzod</span>” by Shar rdza.</p> <p>In the sGom grwa khang, twenty lamas and monks, headed by the abbot, practised the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">rDzogs chen</span> meditation based on the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">dByings rig rin po che’i mdzod</span>, one of the “Five <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">mDzod</span>”.</p> <p>In the Srung ma khang, three monks continuously performed the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">bskang gso</span> ritual for the Bonpo religious protectors.</p> <p>In the ’Khor khang, three persons continuously turned the three wheels of rolled scripture. Besides those who had responsibility in the monastery, there were other lamas who had to make visits to the branch monasteries twice a year in order to see if the monastic codes were observed; others appointed monk officials, exchanged offerings and performed rituals for the people and for the dead. The other duty of these monastic officials was to collect donations.</p> <p>This monastery’s main sources of revenue were its manors - brDa shes, Kha lung, Wa dge, sPra kho, sBa nag and Brang rtswa thang - which produced as much as 250 <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">khal</span> of seed, and Upper and Lower rTa shod in dKar smad, Kha lung and Wa dge, from which they received payment for the rituals of rain-bringing and protection from drought and hail.</p> <p>The total grain earning of the monastery was: from Bam sting, Bal tho, Shog lnga, and Chu gzhung. The monastery also received gifts such as rape-oil. When the year’s harvest was bad the monastery lent about 500 <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">’bo</span> of grain to the villages below the monastery, such as Wa dge, for which it received interest.</p> <p>In brDa shes and other places, the monastery possessed real estate with animals for ploughing, seventy or eighty <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">mdzo mo</span> for dairy purposes and about forty horses and mules for transport.</p> <p>Two families of herdsmen kept the monastery’s 180-plus yaks and <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">’bri</span>, and one hundred goats and sheep. In the nomad areas, such as dNgul phug, ’Gis nang, Om thog kha and brDa ris mda’, the monastery had nomadic people called Thab gsos dud gsum who provided much of the annual expenditure, such as butter for making butter-lamp offerings.</p> <p>The material revenue of the abbot and high lamas covered the cost of living for about forty monks.</p> <p>As for the great hermits in the caves of Mu cho ldem drug, Dran pa nam mkha’, Tshe dbang rig ’dzin, Pad ma ’byung gnas and Blo ldan snying po, they were customarily supported by the well-off families, such as the chiefs of dKar stod, dKar smad, sGar khang, Bya ze, and Nag ru.</p> <p>Before 1959, there were about five hundred monks in this monastery. At present there are six lamas, including Gar dbang rNam rgyal, and about 210 monks. This monastery has an assembly hall with thirty-six pillars, gSer gdung khang, a meditation hall, a college building and other buildings, all of which are adorned with excellent interiors. The main religious objects, of immense value, are as follows: the word-uttering statue of Jo bo nga ’gro, which, having been hidden by many lay and clerical devotees during the Cultural Revolution, was presented to the monastery; a cubit-high statue of Kun bzang rGyal ba rgya mtsho made of <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">rdzi gim</span>; a pair of large and small conchs, which are the transformations of gShen rab’s teeth and his melodic voice; a blue statue of Pad ma ’od ’bar; a statue of gShen lha ’od dkar made of pure gold; a statue of sTon pa Khri gtsug rgyal ba; a statue of Rig ’dzin Dran pa bdud ’dul; a bronze statue of Phur pa ten cubits high; and a seal of Dran pa nam mkha’. All of these can still be seen in the monastery.</p> <p>Annual services and rituals are performed according to the age-old tradition. In particular, in 1984, there was the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">sman sgrub</span> medicine ceremony based on the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">dBal phur ’od zer ’khyil ba’i sman sgrub</span>, during which as many as eighteen thousand lay and clerical devotees from Hor, Shog lnga, Lam lha, Khyung dkar, Khyung nag, Khyung ser, lHa ru and Bag sre crowded into rTse drug Monastery in order to receive initiation and the “medicine” distributed at the time, as well as to enjoy the religious dances.
