Then, driving ninety kilometres in a\n                        north-easterly direction, one reaches Khra rgan Monastery.

During his childhood, Khra chags med lived in Yag yul. At that\n                        time prophecies were made by Ma mchog Srid pa rgyal mo that Khra chags med\n                        should go and preach the Bon doctrine in sacred places in mNga&rsquo; ris, Western\n                        Tibet and Central Tibet in order to establish places for the practice of\n                        meditation.</p>\n\n                     <p>In accordance with these prophecies, Khra chags med visited several sacred\n                        places in mNga&rsquo; ris, and in particular, lHun grub sgang, the monastery of\n                        the Zhu family in gTsang (also known as Ri zhing Monastery, No.4). He\n                        obtained initiations and teachings of Bon in the presence of Blo gros bstan\n                        rgyal of the Zhu lineage, who upheld the Zhu tradition. Motivated by the\n                        prophecies, he went to Khams and searched for a place to settle down. He\n                        found the place, where he later founded Khra rgan Monastery, very\n                        auspicious. Before he founded the monastery a small religious establishment\n                        was already there. It is said that the monastery is called Khra rgan (old\n                        falcon) because the mountain behind the monastery looks like a falcon\n                        warming itself in the sun.</p>\n\n                     <p>There was no line of reincarnation in this monastery, but a series of\n                        successors. Khra chags med was succeeded by Zhu btsun gYung drung khri bde\n                        as the head of the monastery. From him a succession of masters coming from\n                        the Zhu family followed.
