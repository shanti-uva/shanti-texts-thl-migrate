Then, driving ninety kilometres in a north-easterly direction, one reaches Khra rgan Monastery. The monastery was founded in 1699 by Khra chags med bKra shis rgyal mtshan.</p><p>Khra chags med was the son of Gling Ra khra rgan po of the royal lineage of Gling ’Gu zi. During his childhood, Khra chags med lived in Yag yul. At that time prophecies were made by Ma mchog Srid pa rgyal mo that Khra chags med should go and preach the Bon doctrine in sacred places in mNga’ ris, Western Tibet and Central Tibet in order to establish places for the practice of meditation.</p><p>In accordance with these prophecies, Khra chags med visited several sacred places in mNga’ ris, and in particular, lHun grub sgang, the monastery of the Zhu family in gTsang (also known as Ri zhing Monastery, No.4). He obtained initiations and teachings of Bon in the presence of Blo gros bstan rgyal of the Zhu lineage, who upheld the Zhu tradition. Motivated by the prophecies, he went to Khams and searched for a place to settle down. He found the place, where he later founded Khra rgan Monastery, very auspicious. Before he founded the monastery a small religious establishment was already there. It is said that the monastery is called Khra rgan (old falcon) because the mountain behind the monastery looks like a falcon warming itself in the sun.</p><p>There was no line of reincarnation in this monastery, but a series of successors. Khra chags med was succeeded by Zhu btsun gYung drung khri bde as the head of the monastery. From him a succession of masters coming from the Zhu family followed. The lineage of the monastery was, therefore, as follows:</p><ol type=\"1\"> <li> Khra chags med bKra shis rgyal mtshan</li> <li> Zhu btsun gYung drung khri bde</li> <li> Zhu ston Tshul khrims grags pa</li> <li> Zhu btsun gYung drung dbang grags</li> <li> Zhu gYung drung bsod nams</li> <li> Zhu Nyi ma grags pa</li> <li> Zhu Phun tshogs dbang rgyal</li> <li> Zhu Tshul khrims rgyal mtshan</li> <li> Zhu rGyal ba dbang grags</li> <li> Zhu bsTan pa dbang grags</li> <li> Shi cu drung mu</li> <li> Zhu ston gYung drung rgyal ba</li> <li> Zhu Shes rab bstan ’dzin</li> <li> sNan zhig Grub thob</li> <li> Zhu Zla ba grags pa</li> <li> Kun mkhyen Nyi ma bsod nams grags pa</li> <li> rGyal sras Phun tshogs rnam rgyal</li> <li> Zhu rNam rgyal dbang grags</li> <li> Zhu lHun grub rgyal mtshan</li> <li> Zhu gYung drung ye shes</li> <li> Zhu Nyi nyi lags</li> <li> bsTan ’dzin lhun grub</li> <li> bsTan pa dbang rgyal</li> <li> A drung</li> <li> Zhu bsTan ’dzin gtsug phud</li> <li> Zhu bsTan ’dzin grags pa</li> <li> Nyan sgom Rin chen rgyal mtshan</li> <li> Zhu ston bsTan pa lhun grub</li> <li> Zhu Khri ’od</li> <li> Zhu khri gYung drung grags rgyal</li> <li> mKhan po sKal bzang g-yung drung</li> </ol><p>In 1951 mKhan po sKal bzang g-yung drung was still the head of the monastery and his successors right up to 1991 have maintained the tradition of studying, practising and preaching the Bon religion in the monastery.</p><p>This monastery is large and its architectural design is elegant. It stands in marvelous surroundings with a forest of many different trees where one hears large and small birds singing here and there. It is a wonderful place of beauty rarely seen elsewhere.</p><p>As for religious objects, there are twenty-two gilt-bronze statues such as gShen lha ’od dkar, sTon pa gShen rab, rNam par rgyal ba, Byams ma, Dran pa nam mkha’, sTag la me ’bar, Khro bo and Srid pa rgyal mo.
