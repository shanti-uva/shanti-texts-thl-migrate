On the west edge of the shelf a retaining wall segment 8 m long and 1.5 m to 2 m in height has survived (20.301&#900; \/ 45.569&#900;). The most extensive west rim revetment is 13 m long and 1.5 m to 2 m in height (20.340&#900; \/ 45.557&#900;). Just above this wall there is a quadrate structure (9.5 m x 5.7 m) with a depression in the middle. There are no coherent walls left in this larger structure (the remains of a building?). Another, somewhat irregularly shaped, semi-subterranean structure has maximum interior dimensions of 3.7 m x 7.2 m (20.323&#900; \/ 45.569&#900;). Its rear\/east wall is set a maximum of 2 m below the surface and has in situ boulders incorporated in it. The forward\/west wall of this structure is placed about 50 cm below the surface.
