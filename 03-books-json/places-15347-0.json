In its embrace of new models of learning while valuing traditional ways of life, <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15347\">Chungba<\/span>’s experience points to new possibilities in cultural regeneration in rural Tibetan areas.<\/p> "},{"title":"Geography","index":2,"parent_index":0,"body":" <p class=\"paragraph\">The five thousand residents of <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15347\">Chungba<\/span> live scattered in over a dozen villages through a 13km valley system running along the <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Chungchu<\/span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">byung chu<\/span><\/em>) River. Most live high above the valley floor, in tiny hamlets perched precariously along tall green mountains thick with oak, pine, rhododendrons and fruit trees. Cordyceps are plentiful in the higher pastures in late spring, while matsutake mushrooms are available during the rainy season from mid-July to mid-August. Deep in the hollows, a diversity of wildlife can still be found, including, on occasion, snow leopards and roving groups of monkeys. From the headwaters of the <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Chungchu<\/span> River to its mouth at the northern end of the valley system, there is a significant drop in elevation that tracks the transition zone between the grasslands of <span class=\"place\" title=\"F16113\">Litang<\/span> and the dramatic valleys of <span class=\"place\" title=\"F1089\">Nyarong<\/span>.<\/p> "},{"title":"Education and Community","index":3,"parent_index":0,"body":" <p class=\"paragraph\"><span class=\"place\" title=\"F15347\">Chungb<\/span>a’s revitalization is centered in a dynamic community-based education initiative now entering its sixth year of operation. Soon after its founding in 2002, the <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Ruth Walter Chungba Primary School<\/span> undermined regional stereotypes of Tibetan rural education by achieving the highest results on county-wide standardized exams. With its academic success and its dynamic curriculum, the <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Chungba School<\/span> is now regarded as a model primary school for all eighteen counties across <span class=\"place\" title=\"F1079\">Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture<\/span> and has recently been nominated for a Sichuan provincial commendation.<\/p> "},{"title":"Cultural Renewal: Storytelling","index":4,"parent_index":0,"body":" <p class=\"paragraph\">The revitalization of the art of storytelling is an example of cultural renewal through the <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Chungba Primary School<\/span>. Up until as late as the 1940s, a vibrant tradition of professional storytelling existed in <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15374\">Chungba<\/span>. Through the likes of Yika Yeshe of Waleh and Blind Nyarong Ugyen—both prized storytellers who had learned their craft from Gara Jamyang, a peripatetic mid-19th century bard of considerable renown throughout central <span class=\"place\" title=\"F5225\">Kham<\/span>—local historical memory and practices were preserved and transmitted through song and verse. But the tradition of professional storytelling came to an abrupt end in the 1950s. It was not until the establishment of the <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Chungba School<\/span> that the traditional forms were revived. Drawing on his experience as a young monk who had apprenticed himself to then-contemporary local storytellers, school founder Pencho Rabgey brought back to <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15347\">Chungba<\/span> the traditional <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">shadrung<\/span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">zha sgrung<\/span><\/em>), or storyteller’s hat, as well as the practice of <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">drekar<\/span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">’bras dkar<\/span><\/em>), the form through which news was traditionally spread from village to village.

Pre-dating the establishment of the <span class=\"place\" title=\"F16113\">Litang<\/span> monastery, Chonje Gomba was founded in the fifteenth century by two disciples of <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Tsongkhapa<\/span> (<em><span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">tsong kha pa<\/span><\/em>), Tsangchen Kunga Gyatso and Tsangchung Losang Panjor. The latter was the founder of the Neten Tulku lineage, an institution that continues today. According to the Namkha Gyaltsen’s <span class=\"tibtext\" title=\"Type ID here\"><em>lho brag snyan rgyud<\/em><\/span>, the proper name of the monastery is <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kyemyo<\/span> Monastery (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">skyem yo<\/span><\/em>, or \"thirst quenching\").

Throughout the Cultural Revolution, local villagers were forced to take apart the towering ancient pile and throw untold numbers of stones into the river. Some were used to build houses—one of which stands near what remains of the tower today. A shallow pile of stones offers a footprint of where part of the <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15347\">Chungba<\/span> <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">dopung<\/span> once stood.

There is no better way to experience the big sky, rugged passes, ancient woods of <span class=\"place\" title=\"F5225\">Kham<\/span> than to trek into the interior of local lands. Whether on a day hike or a week-long camping excursion, it is not uncommon to observe wildlife ranging from wild boars, bears and monkeys to an assortment of birds of prey. Traveling deep into the valleys and following dirt trails through steep, winding hollows is the only way to reach sacred mountains and protector lakes of the area. With its average elevation of 3600m, treks in <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15347\">Chungba<\/span> start at Grade III (3000 - 4000m), although trips to special sites can easily take trekkers into Grade IV levels (above 4000m). For those who prefer riding to hiking, guided horse treks can be arranged for journeys as short as three hours or as long as five days. All treks organized through the nonprofit organization <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Machik<\/span> will be arranged to help support the local villagers in meeting their basic human needs. The priority for 2007 and 2008 is to meet the electrification needs of all hamlets of <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15347\">Chungba<\/span>.<\/p> "},{"title":"Incense","index":8,"parent_index":0,"body":" <p class=\"paragraph\">The dense forests and high-altitude meadows of <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15347\">Chungba<\/span> provide a bounty of medicinal plants and herbs that make this valley system an ideal location for the craft of traditional Tibetan incense making. Almost all the raw ingredients for traditional Tibetan incense are found locally, growing wild along the thickly carpeted mountain sides that span the villages. But making incense was all but a forgotten craft in <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15347\">Chungba<\/span> until recent years. Fortunately, the art has returned, under the creative stewardship of local social entrepreneur Taja, and itinerant monk scholar, Gen Ata. Drawing on the classic medical text of Gyud Mipham Namgyal Gyamtso as well as firsthand experience among the master incense makers of <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Nyemo<\/span>, the pair have not only revived the tradition of making incense in <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15347\">Chungba<\/span>, they have also collaboratively designed and developed their own unique set of handcrafted tools and methods for producing stick incense. This has not only led to the revival and development of an important cultural tradition, it has also increased local awareness of indigenous plants and herbs and the importance of their conservation to preservation of local cultural knowledge.<\/p>"}]}
