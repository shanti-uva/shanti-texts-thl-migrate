These are often termed \"stateless areas\", though they could also be referred to as settlement-based polity structures where each small-scale human community is an organizational unit onto its own without any broader affiliation.</p>

In addition, may one want to designate a large region as a \"stateless area,\" but then designated smaller units within that large region as such forms of polities as agricultural estates, nomadic tribal areas, or monastic parishes.</p>
