Submissions are welcome from the scholarly community, from single line notes to extensive analysis; however, submissions will be peer reviewed and are not automatically accepted. All submissions are credited to the author, and independent home pages will be created for authors with extensive contributions. Please contact us at thl@collab.itc.virginia.edu.</p>",
