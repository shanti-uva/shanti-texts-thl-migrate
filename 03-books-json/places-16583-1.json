The extent of the structural\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tremains located at <span class=\"popular\">Menlapo Drang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sman bla pho brang</span> (South) indicates that this residential site was larger than any of the contemporary\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBuddhist monasteries at Mount <span class=\"popular\">Tis&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ti se</span>. The three all-stone complexes of <span class=\"popular\">Menlapo Drang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sman bla pho brang</span> (South) represent a very important nucleus of early settlement at <span class=\"popular\">Tis&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ti se</span>.

These three complexes are situated 90 m to 170 m above\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe right side of the valley floor. Their lofty location, all-stone corbelled construction and other\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconstructional features identify them as belonging to the archaic cultural horizon. The three complexes are\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdesignated as east, west and upper. All three have a southern aspect. The east complex and west complex were built\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ton rocky <span class=\"popular emph\">drama</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">gra ma</span> brush-covered slopes. The random-work, 50-cm-\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto 80-cm-thick walls appear to have been both mortared lightly with mud and of the dry-mortar variety.

It was built in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfour main elevations: lower tier, lower-middle tier, upper-middle tier, and upper tier (5030 m). Corbels and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbridging stones lie scattered around the site and farther afield. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The lowest or most forward foundation wall of the main edifice is well aligned in the cardinal directions,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand other walls more or less follow this orientation. The 3.5-m wide lower tier of the structure may only have\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconsisted of a retaining wall and not a superstructure, but little structural evidence is left to appraise. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The middle tier of the main edifice is approximately 6 m wide. The east half of this level of the structure\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tappears to have consisted of a walled courtyard. The east-facing entranceway to the east half of the middle\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttier opens onto this courtyard. This appears to have been the main entrance of the main edifice. This entryway\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmeasures at least 1.2 m high x 70 cm. Located in a 2.3-m high wall segment, the lintel over this entrance is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin situ. It accesses an axial corridor with lower-middle tier rooms set on both its north and south sides.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOutside the main entrance there seem to be the remains of another room that appears to have had an independent\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tentrance. On the north side of the medial corridor there is a room largely filled with rubble (1.5 m x 1.2 m).\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThere were two or three niches built into the walls of this room. The lintel and roof of this north room have\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tendured; the doorway accessing it is typically small. From the central corridor there is a 1-m long aisle that\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\truns perpendicular (south-north), which accesses one or two rooms set on the south side of the lower-middle\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttier. The walls around these rooms are very fragmentary. From these forward lower-middle tier rooms there is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\taccess to a rear lower-middle tier room, which has a largely intact roof. The internal dimensions of this\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tirregularly shaped room are 1.3 m x 2 m. None of these lower-middle tier rooms extend as far as the external\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twest wall of the <span class=\"popular emph\">sekhang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">gsas khang</span>. The upper-middle tier\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trooms are also reached via the central corridor. Above the entire lower-middle tier and axial corridor, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\textending to the exterior west wall of the main edifice, there were probably seven or eight small rooms in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttotal, however, most partitions between them have been destroyed. The upper-middle tier covers approximately\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t50 m&sup2;. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The upper tier of the main edifice appears to have consisted of three relatively large rooms with an\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\teast-west orientation. In addition, there is another room to the rear of the central room. This rear central\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\troom (2 m x 1.3 m) has a large central niche. Not including their exterior walls, the row of three rooms\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmeasures 6.7 m x 2.4 m. Internally, walls still reach a height of 2 m. A lone roof slab over the central room\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tis in place as is one corbel on the rear wall of the east room. A large boulder is integrated into the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\texterior west wall. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Adjacent to these upper tier rooms there is a relatively large room to the east, which has an independent\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tentrance. It has interior dimensions of 3.2 m x 2 m (not including the entrance area) and exterior dimensions\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof 4 m x 4.5 m; these relative proportions convey the general massiveness of the <span class=\"popular emph\">sekhang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">gsas khang</span> walls. The roof over the west half of this independent\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tupper tier structure has survived. It is of typical construction: stone beams run diagonally over the corners\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the walls, upon which transverse bridging stones were laid. This understructure supports the roof slabs.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThere are also large corbels protruding from the east half of the rear wall as load-bearing structures. In the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsouth wall there is a niche and possibly a small window below it. This independent east room opens onto the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmiddle tier room that probably had an independent entrance. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Outlying structures","index":9,"parent_index":7,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Just above the main edifice of the east complex there are two walled level areas, the larger of which\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmeasures 13 m x 7 m.

Approximately\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t15 m above these structures, at the edge of a ledge, there are the remains of what appears to have been a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlater historic period retreat house (3.5 m x 5 m). </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Upper edifice","index":10,"parent_index":7,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The upper edifice is comprised of a single <span class=\"popular emph\">do khang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rdo khang</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbuilt on a shelf against a cliff (5080 m). It measures 9 m (east-west) x 8 m (north-south). Roof members are\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstrewn around the site; clearly this was an all-stone structure.

This passageway is situated at the same elevation as the upper tier compartments.

The three rooms of the upper tier have intact roofs and entranceways. The rear of these three rooms was\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbuilt into the adjoining cliff and their roof is flush with the level of the uphill slope, according them a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsemi-subterranean aspect. The exterior west wall at 2.5 m is the highest elevation structure extant in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tupper edifice. The interior dimensions of the west room are 1.9 m x 1.1 m x 1.8 m. There is a niche in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tforward wall and an aperture (35 cm x 45 cm) in the side wall that opens to the central room. The entranceway\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto the west room (1.3 m x 60 cm) is partially blocked by debris. The central room (2 m x 1.4 m x 1.8 m) has an\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tentranceway at least 1 m in height and 70 cm in width (it is also obstructed by debris).
