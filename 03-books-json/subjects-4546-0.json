Although they wereÂ  both divided into five Thousand-Household Districts (<em>stong sde</em>), which are supposed to the administrative sub-division of Horns, none of them were called a Horn. In this way, until our understanding of the administrative status of Upper and Lower Zhang Zhung becomes clear, they are both categorized as being Unknow Types of Entities of the Tibetan Empire (Yarlung Dynasty).</p>",
