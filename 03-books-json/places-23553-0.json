The eldest, Nam mkha&rsquo;i rgyal po, founded Zla &rsquo;od monastery\n                        (No.146) and became known as Zla &rsquo;od Nam mkha&rsquo;i rgyal po, the second son,\n                        Nyi ma&rsquo;i rgyal po, founded gTsug &rsquo;od temple in the Wood-Dragon year of the\n                        2nd Rab byung (1124) near Zla &rsquo;od Monastery, and became known as gTsug &rsquo;od\n                        Nyi ma&rsquo;i rgyal po. </p>\n\n                     <p>Nyi ma&rsquo;i rgyal po married sKal bzang lha mo and had three sons. bsTan pa\n                        lhun grub, the eldest son and bDe skyid lha mo had two sons. bsTan pa &rsquo;od\n                        zer, the elder one and rTa mgrin mtsho, had a son called lHun grub dbang\n                        ldan, who became a renowned master. He and gYung drung dbang mo had four\n                        sons. The youngest son married rNa ba tshang Shes rab sgrol ma and had five\n                        sons, the middle son became a gter ston. He discovered many gter ma texts\n                        and was initiated into the practice of rtsa rlung by Nyag gter gSang sngags\n                        gling pa. The youngest son, Pad ma g-yung drung, had three sons, the\n                        youngest of whom, gYung drung rgyal mtshan, married Nyi li Bo legs and had\n                        two sons. One of the two sons bsTan pa married gZha&rsquo; tsha Rig &rsquo;dzin lha mo\n                        and had two sons. The eldest son dBang phyug married Khra tshang Gu ru sgrol\n                        ma and had only one son called Phun tshogs who, with Zla &rsquo;od sgrol ma, had\n                        three sons; the second son, Rig &rsquo;dzin, was a disciple of Shar rdza bKra shis\n                        rgyal mtshan (1858-1934). He married sTag mgo A rnang sgrol ma and had a son\n                        called &rsquo;Chi med rgyal mtshan who was recognized by &rsquo;Jam dbyang mkhyen brtse\n                        and Thar bde Dri med as the reincarnation of Rab brtan shes rab of lCang\n                        lung Monastery (No.148) in the same county. </p>\n\n                     <p>In the lifetime of &rsquo;Chi med rgyal mtshan, the monastery was looted by Nyi\n                        grags tshang, a Buddhist family in the same area and the Bon religion was\n                        banned until the middle of 20th century.

It is anonymous. Its author claims\n                        that he saw a chronology of the monastery entitled bsTan rtsis nor phreng\n                        rab gsal me long, beginning in the Earth-Serpent year of the 5th Rab byung\n                        (1269) and ending in 1489. Then new additions were made to bring it up to\n                        1991. The date of the monastery&rsquo;s foundation mentioned above was taken from\n                        the anonymous work gTsug &rsquo;od dgon.
