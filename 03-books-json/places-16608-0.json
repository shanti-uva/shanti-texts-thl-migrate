The main or east sector (41 m x 35 m) consists of a dense collection of what appear to have been residential units. It is difficult to discern how many buildings were located on the bench making up the east sector. There are also middle and west sectors containing a variety of ceremonial and utilitarian structures, which probably reflect differing stages in the historical development of the <span class=\"popular\">Lung Ngak<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Lung ngag<\/span> site.

This wall was built on a stone footing, and may belong to a different phase of site development from that of the dominant stone structures. On the forward edge of the east sector bench there is a four-sided pillar of white granite (1.3 m x 1.4). It appears to be a natural hunk of stone that was in all probability planted vertically in the ground. Its function is not apparent. <\/p> "},{"title":"East sector shrines","index":10,"parent_index":7,"body":null},{"title":"Middle sector","index":11,"parent_index":6,"body":null},{"title":"West sector","index":12,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p>The west sector of the old <span class=\"popular\">Lung Ngak<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Lung ngag<\/span> settlement is situated 110 m west of the east sector. It was built on its own bench, which is elevated 10 m above the valley floor. Overlooking the rim of the bench there is a line of four structures extending for 120 m. These appear to be the foundations of decimated buildings. From east to west they measure: 1) 17 m x 11 m, 2) 12.6 m x 4.4 m, 3) 7 m x 5.3 m (these foundation walls are set as much as 1 m into the ground), and 4) 18.5 m x 11 m (this appears to have been a multi-roomed structure). Above the east portion of this line of structures here are three more circular structures (up to 7 m in diameter) that resemble threshing pads. Above the bench on a level area of the slope there are the remains of two more buildings, spaced 10 m apart. These fragmentary foundations measure 12 m x 8 m and 18 m x 8 m. <\/p> "},{"title":"Lung ngag agriculture","index":13,"parent_index":6,"body":null}]}
