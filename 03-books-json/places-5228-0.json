This implies that\n                        it was Sad ne ga&rsquo;u of Zhang zhung sgo pa who first established gYu bun\n                        Monastery. He is one of the thirteen masters found among the eighty adepts\n                        of the Bon tradition.</p>\n\n                     <p>Sad ne ga&rsquo;u was born in Zhang zhung. His father was rGyal mtshan bde ba and\n                        his mother was rGyal bza&rsquo; klong yang. He studied under several teachers,\n                        like A nu &rsquo;phrag thag, so that he was finally able to accomplish his\n                        learning.</p>\n\n                     <p>He exhibited many miraculous signs in the gYu bun community, such as curing\n                        leprosy patients just by looking at them, forcing back attackers and floods,\n                        taming wild carnivorous animals so that he could use them for\n                        transportation, igniting himself, subduing wickedness, being able to cross\n                        the lake Dwang ra riding on a drum and being able to build a crystal stupa\n                        in a river.</p>\n\n                     <p>After having meditated for attaining perfection, he vanished just like the\n                        light of a rainbow. After that, history tells us, many great masters\n                        appeared one after another. Although the monastery sometimes experienced\n                        periods without strong leadership, there were other times when it had\n                        several holy ones who maintained universalism and remained meditating. Among\n                        them was mTshungs med rNam dag tshul khrims, who came to the monastery\n                        around 1687. He promoted the development of the monastic community and it\n                        continued to grow through the time of his disciples, including Tshul khrims\n                        lhun grub, up until the time of the fourth master. After that the monastery\n                        was suppressed, but was taken care of and rehabilitated by sKyid gsum bla\n                        brang, who was the benefactor of the master gYung drung lha rtse.</p>\n\n                     <p>In short, this monastic community was one that was outstandingly blessed, to\n                        which many excellent masters came at every stage of the early development of\n                        Bonpo teachings, and where many holy ones of Zhang zhung died, passing into\n                        the rainbow light.</p>\n\n                     <p>The monastery possessed a number of important religious objects, some of\n                        which were later moved to other places: for example, Sad ne ga&rsquo;u&rsquo;s conch was\n                        taken to Thob rgyal sMan ri Monastery (No.1).</p>\n\n                     <p>In the 1980s the monastery was reconstructed under the responsibility of the\n                        reincarnation bsTan &rsquo;dzin dbang grags.

It is therefore apparent\n                        that the monastery was named Ser zhig after the family name of the lama who\n                        founded the monastery in 1405. Ser zhig Monastery is the biggest one in the\n                        Nag tshang Dwang ra g-yu mtsho area. Because of this, the Fifth Dalai Lama\n                        recognized it as a monastery of the government and permitted it to have a\n                        certain number of the local people as its retainers. The monastery is also\n                        called Se zhig skor lde, since it is one of the seven Nag tshang sger\n                        tsho.</p>\n\n                     <p>The monastery consisted of a two-storey temple, the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">bla\n                           brang</span> and monks&rsquo; quarters. There were many religious objects and\n                        books. Besides these, there were religious objects transferred from Nyi lung\n                        &rsquo;gram, the seat of &rsquo;Dzi bon dBang gi rgyal mtshan, when it was destroyed.\n                        However, invaded by the barbarous Mongolian forces of Jungar, Ser zhig\n                        Monastery was turned into a military camp, and the temple and monks&rsquo;\n                        quarters were soon destroyed.</p>\n\n                     <p>After that, a number of people launched themselves into its reconstruction,\n                        as well as maintaining the doctrine. They included the one called Zhang\n                        zhung Lama, a descendant of Gu ru lama, a lama of the Zhu family from &rsquo;Jed\n                        spang lung, a lama of the Shel zhig family and others. </p>\n\n                     <p>The main religious objects of the monastery were as follows: a black square\n                        stone called A ma sa gsum with the three white letters A, Ma and Sa on it; a\n                        small conch made of a devotee&rsquo;s teeth; a tooth of the sTon pa gShen rab&rsquo;s\n                        horse with a self-risen letter A on it; a Garuda&rsquo;s claw as big as a yak&rsquo;s\n                        horn; and a self-grown figure of Zhi ba Kun du bzang po within a crystal\n                        stupa.</p>\n\n                     <p>Besides these, the monastery had a small drum, which is said to be a present\n                        given to a Ser zhig lama by the local deity gDong dmar lha btsan of rTa sgo.\n                        Among the patrons of the monastery it used to be the custom for patrons to\n                        appeal to the abbot to let one of them beat the drum when the ritual Ma tri\n                        bum sgrub was performed, for it was said that if one could beat the drum\n                        three time, he might get rid of all the bad luck or misfortune of the whole\n                        year, and his wish might be fulfilled. The patron was expected to offer five\n                        silver tam kar and a ceremonial scarf for each beat. All the people in the\n                        neighbourhood, lay and clergy, both Buddhists and Bonpo, showed boundless\n                        respect for this drum. At mass meetings, three beats of the drum by the\n                        abbot preceded the chanting; only then was the prayer conductor to begin\n                        leading the chorus.</p>\n\n                     <p>In the protector&rsquo;s temple was a mask of the deity A bse, called Nga &rsquo;dra ma.\n                        This designation was derived from the words spoken by the deity to the mask\n                        maker, &ldquo;this mask looks like me&rdquo; (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">nga &rsquo;dra</span>), which\n                        turned the mask into an object of great rarity.</p>\n\n                     <p>It is said that there were many old, important religious objects in the\n                        monastery, such as the skull of sTon pa gShen rab with a self-produced\n                        letter A on it, his teeth with a self-produced Gu ru on them, a statue of\n                        sTon pa with a self-produced mantra <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">Om ma ti ma ye sa\n                           le&rsquo;du</span> on the upper right part of it, and armour that belonged to\n                        sTon pa (said to have been taken to Xian in China).</p>\n\n                     <p>The teaching and practice of this monastery have actually experienced rise\n                        and fall in every stage of its history.
