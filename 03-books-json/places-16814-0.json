It is reported that human bones and ceramic shards were found inside FS4. No traces of these objects remain visible at the site. Many stones (up to 80 cm long) were left in a pile beside where FS4 once stood. It appears from local testimonies, that the subsurface architecture of FS4 consisted of a stone-lined burial chamber. This rock laden structure contrasts with the adjoining slopes, which are free of stones. <\/p> "},{"title":"Funerary Structure FS5","index":11,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p>Funerary structure FS5 is situated approximately 5 m below the FS1 to FS4 line of tombs (30.476΄ \/ 10.139΄).
