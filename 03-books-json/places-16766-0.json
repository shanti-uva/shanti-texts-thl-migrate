Only tiny wall sections are still extant along the flanks of this rock and earthen mound. The random-rubble double-course fragments that have survived are composed of smaller stones. Reportedly, in the 1980s, stones were extracted from FS5 in order to build adjacent houses. Interestingly, several years after being built, these houses were abandoned, probably because of the perceived negative effects associated with using stones from a so-called <span class=\"popular emph\">mön dur</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mon dur</span>. Roughly 70 m northwest of FS5 there is a small rocky tumulus (under 50 cm high) on which old <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma ṇi</span> plaques rest.
