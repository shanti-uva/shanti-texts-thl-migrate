This structure is elevated about 1 m above the surrounding terrain and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\texhibits no coherent wall sections. Adjacent to its northeast side there is a row of four small broken tabular\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpillars (30 cm or less in height). The broad sides of these pillars are set perpendicular to the axis of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstructure. The configuration of these pillars and that of the adjoining structure suggest they may be an example\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof a small array of pillars with an appended edifice (II.1c). However, not enough structural evidence remains in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tplace to make a positive determination.
