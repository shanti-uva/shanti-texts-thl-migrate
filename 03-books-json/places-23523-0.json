   "body": "<p> So nag is a large community situated in the pasture of gCan tsha County. There were only lay tantrics in the gSas khang, but recently there are also some monks from the community, but since the monks do not have a monastery, both lay tantrics and monks practise togather in the gSas khang. No records seem to exist about the history of the gSas khang. I visited it in 1996, but unfortunately there was not any old tantric from whom one could get some information on local history concerning the gSas khang. I hope to be able to fill up this gap when this book appears in Tibetan edition in the future.</p>
