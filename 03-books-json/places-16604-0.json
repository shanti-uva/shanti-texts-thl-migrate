The site occupies the north rim of an amphitheatre in the upper portion of the <span class=\"popular\">A wang</span><span class=\"scholar\">A dbang</span> valley. Below this amphitheatre, the many rivulets of the a dbang chu converge. The nine poorly preserved <span class=\"popular emph\">do khang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rdo khang</span> of the site were built on a series of rocky and turf-covered shelves. The shifting sandy soil appears to have hastened their disintegration. Although the structures are quite widely spaced, they are all in view of one another. A pass called <span class=\"popular\">Nang Chu La</span><span class=\"scholar\">Nang chu la</span> connects <span class=\"popular\">A wang</span><span class=\"scholar\">A dbang</span> with <span class=\"popular\">Dzong Chu</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdzong chu</span> on the <span class=\"popular\">Tisé</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ti se</span> circumambulatory trail. The edifices of <span class=\"popular\">A wang</span><span class=\"scholar\">A dbang</span> have a southern or southwestern aspect and are in eyeshot of <span class=\"popular\">Langa Tso</span><span class=\"scholar\">La lnga mtsho</span>. From vantage points just above the site ma pang g.yu mtsho can also be seen. Although all the <span class=\"popular\">do khang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo khang</span> are extremely degraded, it appears that they were constructed in the typical fashion. All structures have been leveled below the roofline. Rather than being oriented in the cardinal directions, these buildings were aligned in conformance with local topographic conditions. There are no signs of mortar in the random-rubble walls (50 cm to 60 cm thick). Gray slabs of variable length (primarily 20 cm to 60 cm long) were used in the construction of these walls. Scattered among the debris of the <span class=\"popular\">do khang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo khang</span> are corbels and roof sheathing (up to 1.5 m long). </p> <p> <span class=\"popular\">A wang</span><span class=\"scholar\">A dbang</span> was an integral community occupying an exclusive geographic zone. It probably catered to the religious and perhaps political elite of the region, who physically removed themselves from the main centers of economic production (pastoral and agricultural) located in lower elevation areas. Unlike some of the archaic residential sites around <span class=\"popular\">Tisé</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ti se</span>, there are no signs that the Buddhists reoccupied <span class=\"popular\">A wang</span><span class=\"scholar\">A dbang</span>. Its location outside the confines of the <span class=\"popular\">Tisé</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ti se</span> circumambulatory path appears to have made this site of marginal importance to the Buddhists of the area. Given the extent of the ruins, several dozen people may have once resided at any given time at<span class=\"popular\">A wang</span><span class=\"scholar\">A dbang</span>. There would be little use for a single individual to occupy the eight or nine rooms that seem to have comprised most buildings. As such, these <span class=\"popular emph\">do khang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rdo khang</span> may have housed family units or groups of religious practitioners. </p> "},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":" <p>None appears to exist.</p> "},{"title":"Site elements","index":6,"parent_index":2,"body":" "},{"title":"Residential complex","index":7,"parent_index":6,"body":" "},{"title":"Residential Structure RS1","index":8,"parent_index":7,"body":" <p>Residential structure RS1 (9.3 m x 4.3 m)<a href=\"#n86\" name=\"nb86\" class=\"note\">86</a> is located on the edge of a grassy prow (30° 58.04΄ N. lat. / 81° 22.98΄ E. long. / 5170 m).
