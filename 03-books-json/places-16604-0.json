The site occupies the north rim of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tan amphitheatre in the upper portion of the <span class=\"popular\">A wang</span><span class=\"scholar\">A dbang</span> valley. Below this amphitheatre, the many rivulets of the a dbang chu\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconverge. The nine poorly preserved <span class=\"popular emph\">do khang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rdo khang</span> of the site\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twere built on a series of rocky and turf-covered shelves. The shifting sandy soil appears to have hastened their\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdisintegration. Although the structures are quite widely spaced, they are all in view of one another. A pass\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcalled <span class=\"popular\">Nang Chu La</span><span class=\"scholar\">Nang chu la</span> connects <span class=\"popular\">A wang</span><span class=\"scholar\">A dbang</span> with <span class=\"popular\">Dzong Chu</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdzong chu</span> on the <span class=\"popular\">Tis&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ti se</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcircumambulatory trail. The edifices of <span class=\"popular\">A wang</span><span class=\"scholar\">A dbang</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thave a southern or southwestern aspect and are in eyeshot of <span class=\"popular\">Langa Tso</span><span class=\"scholar\">La lnga mtsho</span>. From vantage points just above the site ma pang g.yu\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmtsho can also be seen. Although all the <span class=\"popular\">do khang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo khang</span> are extremely degraded, it appears that they were constructed in the typical fashion. All\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstructures have been leveled below the roofline. Rather than being oriented in the cardinal directions, these\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbuildings were aligned in conformance with local topographic conditions. There are no signs of mortar in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trandom-rubble walls (50 cm to 60 cm thick). Gray slabs of variable length (primarily 20 cm to 60 cm long) were\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tused in the construction of these walls. Scattered among the debris of the <span class=\"popular\">do khang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo khang</span> are corbels and roof sheathing (up to 1.5 m long). </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"popular\">A wang</span><span class=\"scholar\">A dbang</span> was an integral community occupying an\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\texclusive geographic zone. It probably catered to the religious and perhaps political elite of the region, who\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tphysically removed themselves from the main centers of economic production (pastoral and agricultural) located in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlower elevation areas. Unlike some of the archaic residential sites around <span class=\"popular\">Tis&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ti se</span>, there are no signs that the Buddhists reoccupied\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"popular\">A wang</span><span class=\"scholar\">A dbang</span>. Its location outside the confines of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe <span class=\"popular\">Tis&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ti se</span> circumambulatory path appears to have made\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthis site of marginal importance to the Buddhists of the area. Given the extent of the ruins,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tseveral dozen people may have once resided at any given time at<span class=\"popular\">A wang</span><span class=\"scholar\">A dbang</span>. There would be little use for a single individual to occupy the eight or nine rooms that\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tseem to have comprised most buildings. As such, these <span class=\"popular emph\">do khang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rdo\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tkhang</span> may have housed family units or groups of religious practitioners. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>None appears to exist.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Site elements","index":6,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Residential complex","index":7,"parent_index":6,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Residential Structure RS1","index":8,"parent_index":7,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Residential structure RS1 (9.3 m x 4.3 m)<a href=\"#n86\" name=\"nb86\" class=\"note\">86</a> is located on the edge of a grassy prow (30&deg; 58.04&#900; N. lat. / 81&deg; 22.98&#900; E. long. / 5170 m).
