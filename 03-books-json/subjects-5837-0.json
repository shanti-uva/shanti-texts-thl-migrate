The most important category involves somatic yogas in which subtle bodies are contemplatively manipulated to recreate extreme experiences, especially sexual and death-related experiences.

These are typically transmitted in Tibet in anthologies, the most famous example being perhaps The Six Yogas of N\u0101ropa.
