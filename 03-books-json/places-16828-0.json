This enclosure exhibits a complex design with a number of interior structural features. Certain parts\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof FS1 are elevated as much as 50 cm above the adjoining terrain, while other parts are level with the ground\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsurface. Towards the middle of the southeast side of the enclosure there are five large upright slabs planted in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe ground. These slabs form a single line, and are 45 cm to 80 cm in length and project 22 cm to 50 cm above\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tground level. Beside them are three adjacent upright slabs that form a quadrate structure with one open side.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe three slabs of this structure are between 65 cm and 90 cm in length and rise 10 cm to 20 cm above ground\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlevel. Near the center of FS1 are the faint remains of another structure that possibly marks the location of a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsubsurface tomb. A southeast-northwest oriented wall of smaller flat slabs seems to bisect FS1. The middle\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tportion of this wall merges with the central structure. There are also a few upright slabs rooted near the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsouthwest end of FS1. The northeast perimeter wall course contains some upright slabs as well. Three slabs (each\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t85 cm long), placed parallel to and in very close proximity to one another, are planted next to the northeast\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tperimeter wall, perpendicular to its course. Likewise, near the north corner of FS1 there is a single slab (1 m\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlong, 20 cm projection from the surface) that is set perpendicular to the perimeter wall course. There are a few\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tother upright slabs planted in different places of the interior of FS1, which formed structural elements of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tunknown configurations. There are also some upright slabs planted here and there outside the confines of FS1.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThese may be remnants of ancillary funerary structures. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Funerary Structure FS2","index":8,"parent_index":6,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Funerary structure FS2 (13.6 m x 9 m) is situated 90 m east of FS1, at the foot of an enclosing ridge.
