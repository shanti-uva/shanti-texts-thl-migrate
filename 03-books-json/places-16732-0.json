Much of the double-course slab-wall enclosure has survived intact. The individual slabs are flush with the ground surface or project above it to a maximum height of 15 cm. The double-course east wall (50 cm hick) consists of slabs 20 cm to 40 cm in length. There is an opening or &lsquo;portal&rsquo; in the east wall, demarcated by two slabs (40 cm and 50 cm long), which run perpendicular to the wall course. This 30-cm wide portal is fairly well centered between the north and south walls of the enclosure. The north wall (50 cm to 65 cm thick) of the enclosure is composed of slabs up to 55 cm in length. The first 5.5 m of the east side of the north wall is largely intact, while the remaining segment to the west has lost the inner course of parallel slabs. Most of he outer line of slabs in the south wall and the inner line of slabs in the west wall are also in situ. These slabs are up to 65 cm in length. The south wall is punctuated by an opening 1.1 m in width, which is demarcated by two slabs (40 cm and 50 cm long) placed perpendicular to the wall course. This opening begins 3.9 m from the southwest corner of the enclosure. This appears to be the only example of a &lsquo;portal&rsquo; in any but the east wall surveyed to date, but due to much degradation of the enclosure, the structural evidence is somewhat ambiguous. The horns of goats and sheep are scattered around the enclosure. It is a fairly common practice for <span class=\"popular emph\">drok pa<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">&rsquo;brog pa<\/span> to deposit the horns of livestock at such sites as a magical means to protect the herds. <\/p> "},{"title":"Pillars","index":8,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p>There are two highly eroded pillars planted inside the enclosure. The unbroken specimen is situated 40 cm from he inner edge of the west wall. This irregularly shaped gray pillar has weathered to a reddish brown color (1.2 m [height] x 1 m [basal girth]). The unbroken pillar slightly tilts to the north. There is also a broken tabular or irregularly shaped pillar standing to the north of the unbroken specimen (55 cm x 1.3 m). The massive girth of the broken pillar indicates that originally it must have been of substantial height. Like its unbroken counterpart, this uncut gray piece of rock has weathered to a reddish brown color.<\/p> "},{"title":"Outlying funerary structures","index":9,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p>Funerary structures FS1 to FS5 are all located on the level floor of the basin.<\/p> "},{"title":"Funerary Structure FS1","index":10,"parent_index":9,"body":" <p>Funerary structure FS1 is situated 52 m northwest of the walled pillars. This quadrate double-course upright slab-wall enclosure is aligned in the cardinal directions. It measures 6.8 m (north-south) x 7.2 m (east-west). Surviving double-course wall fragments are 40 cm to 80 cm in thickness. In the west wall there is a segment 1.6 m in length and 60 cm in thickness, which is composed of multiple courses of small slabs. There are five to seven of these slabs (10 cm to 30 cm long) running abreast of one other in meandering lines.<\/p> "},{"title":"Funerary Structure FS2","index":11,"parent_index":9,"body":" <p>Funerary structure FS2 is situated 30 m north of the walled pillars. This structure has been reduced to just hree adjacent slabs (50 cm to 85 cm long). Two of these upright slabs run perpendicular to the alignment of he third one.

There are just six slabs (30 cm to 70 cm long) laid edgewise into the ground in the south wall of this highly fragmentary quadrate enclosure. There are also three in situ slabs in what appears to be the northwest corner of the structure and one slab in place in its northeast corner. The surviving structural evidence suggests that FS3 may have had single-course perimeter walls.<\/p> "},{"title":"Funerary Structure FS4","index":13,"parent_index":9,"body":" <p>Funerary structure FS4 (5 m x 5.3 m) is situated 26 m north of FS3.

This highly deteriorated quadrate enclosure roughly measures 14.2 m (north-south) x 6 m (east-west). Only a few blocks and slabs of the walls are still in place.

FS7 is elevated about 70 cm above the adjacent terrain on its south side, while its north\/uphill side is level with the slope.

The perimeter walls of this small enclosure are composed of a single line of upright slabs (10 cm to 25 cm long). The south side of this structure has been destroyed. Given its diminutive size, FS8 may have served a very different funerary function from that of neighboring structures. <\/p> "},{"title":"Funerary Structure FS9","index":18,"parent_index":9,"body":" <p>Funerary structure FS9 (2.3 m x 2 m) is situated 8.4 m north\/uphill of FS8.
