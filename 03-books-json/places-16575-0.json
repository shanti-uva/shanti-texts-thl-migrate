Its southeast\/downhill side is 6 m wide, while towards the northwest his sector widens to 15 m across. Freestanding wall fragments are no more than 80 cm in height. Revetments add 1 m to 1.5 m of elevation to the structures. Much of the perimeter wall surrounding the southeast sector has been leveled and no interior partition walls have survived. The mud-mortared random-work walls are around 60 cm o 70 cm in thickness. Variable-sized pieces of limestone (up to 70 cm long) were used in construction, but most of the stones are small. The floor plan has been almost totally obliterated. Scant footing fragments suggest hat the southeast sector was divided into at least four sections. The walls flanking the entranceway have a maximum elevation of 2.2 m. These walls extend beyond what must have been the actual opening to the interior, creating an inlet 2.1 m in width. This passageway must have once supported a stairway but all that is left is a natural ramp of stone. On the southwest\/exterior wall comprising the inlet, above the 70 cm or 80 cm of freestanding stonework, there are the faint remains of adobe-block courses. These add 20 cm or less to the total height of the wall. The adobe wall traces have been eroded to the point that they are no more than 20 cm in hickness. The inner wall of the inlet reaches 2.5 m in height, including its revetment, the highest elevation structure in the southeast sector. <\/p> "},{"title":"Northwest edifice","index":8,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p>The northwest or upper sector of <span class=\"popular\">Rula Khar<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Ru la mkhar<\/span> consists of a single edifice (11.5 m x 4 m), which sits atop a highly prominent revetment. The high walls of this edifice and its position at the vertex of the site, suggests that this was the highest status habitation at the site. No interior wall partitions are intact in this stone and adobe structure. The limited structural evidence suggests that it was divided into two rooms: southeast (forward) and northwest (rear). The revetment on the northeast side of the structure attains 2 m in height. The rear or northwest face of the edifice rests upon a revetment with rounded corners, which extends 2 m laterally beyond the superstructure. This unusually designed revetment is 1.8 m in height, and the walls above it add another 1.6 m o the height of the structure. The rear freestanding wall segment is made entirely of adobe blocks, which have been subjected to extreme erosion. Most other freestanding walls fragments are less than 1 m in height. In the southwest corner of the northwest edifice there is a highly degraded adobe wall segment (2.5 m in height) resting upon a high revetment (around 1.8 m in height). <\/p> <p>At the base of the interior rear wall of the northwest edifice, wood bonding materials are still in situ. I was able to extract a well-preserved piece of <span class=\"popular emph\">drama<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">gra ma<\/span> wood (15 cm long, 10 cm in circumference) for radiocarbon analysis.<a href=\"#n69\" name=\"nb69\" class=\"note\">69<\/a> The excellent physical condition of the sample facilitated species identification. This piece of wood was structurally integral to the construction of the adobe-block wall. Along with similar pieces of wood it helped to stabilize the interface between the stone revetment and adobe superstructure. These bonding materials lie perpendicular to the axis of the wall and could be extracted with relative ease and with minimal disturbance o the structure. The sample tested yielded a conventional radiocarbon age of circa 565 to 705 CE, corresponding o the late protohistoric and early imperial periods. Given the relatively small diameter of the piece of wood assayed, it is not likely to have been cut down too many years before it was used in the construction of <span class=\"popular\">Rula Khar<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Ru la mkhar<\/span>. It is likely, therefore, an excellent indicator of when the northwest edifice was either founded or rebuilt. It is possible that rather than reflecting the establishment of the installation, the chronometric evidence may be applicable to a reconstruction process. In any event, adobe-block superstructures are relatively easy to demolish and rebuild. If a foundation date is indicated, it may well reflect chronological values pertinent to the southeast\/lower sector of the facility. Both sectors of <span class=\"popular\">Rula Khar<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Ru la mkhar<\/span> share the same ensemble of constructional traits (system of revetting, adobe-block upper courses, random-rubble limestone fabric, and close structural integration). <\/p> <p>The raising of <span class=\"popular\">Rula Khar<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Ru la mkhar<\/span> is probably linked to the agricultural land-base of its environs, which must have provided the cereal surpluses needed to support an elite monumental and social infrastructure (regional and interregional trade notwithstanding). We can be quite confident, then, that a viable farming community existed at <span class=\"popular\">Rula Khar<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Ru la mkhar<\/span> until at least the seventh or eight century CE. The genesis of agriculture in the area, however, is likely to date to a much more remote period, given the generally more conducive environmental conditions of earlier times and the inherent economic and strategic significance of extensive arable lands. If <span class=\"popular\">Rula Khar<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Ru la mkhar<\/span> was founded before circa 630 CE, it was built as part of an indigenous (<span class=\"popular\">Zhang Zhung<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Zhang zhung<\/span>) polity. A later foundation date (circa 630 to 750 CE) would indicate hat this facility arose within the pan-Tibetan imperium before the reign of King <span class=\"popular\">Tri Songdetsen<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Khri srong lde btsan<\/span>. <\/p> "},{"title":"Shrine","index":9,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p>Southeast of the residential complex, 15 m lower in elevation, there are the remains of a cubic shrine (1.7 m x 1.7 m).
