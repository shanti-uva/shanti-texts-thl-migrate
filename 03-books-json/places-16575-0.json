Its not particularly lofty aspect and the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tabsence of defensive works indicate that it was not a fortress per se, but rather a palace and/or religious\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcomplex. Much of <span class=\"popular\">Rula Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ru la mkhar</span> has been leveled\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto its foundations.

A 3.5-m tall expanse of rock separates the two\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsectors. Various wall sections in both sectors contain herringbone courses of masonry.

Revetments add\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 m to 1.5 m of elevation to the structures. Much of the perimeter wall surrounding the southeast sector has\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen leveled and no interior partition walls have survived. The mud-mortared random-work walls are around 60 cm\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto 70 cm in thickness. Variable-sized pieces of limestone (up to 70 cm long) were used in construction, but most\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the stones are small. The floor plan has been almost totally obliterated. Scant footing fragments suggest\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the southeast sector was divided into at least four sections.

On the southwest/exterior wall comprising the inlet, above the 70 cm or 80 cm of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfreestanding stonework, there are the faint remains of adobe-block courses.

No interior wall partitions are intact in this stone and adobe structure. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlimited structural evidence suggests that it was divided into two rooms: southeast (forward) and northwest\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(rear). The revetment on the northeast side of the structure attains 2 m in height. The rear or northwest face\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the edifice rests upon a revetment with rounded corners, which extends 2 m laterally beyond the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsuperstructure. This unusually designed revetment is 1.8 m in height, and the walls above it add another 1.6 m\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto the height of the structure. The rear freestanding wall segment is made entirely of adobe blocks, which have\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen subjected to extreme erosion. Most other freestanding walls fragments are less than 1 m in height. In the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsouthwest corner of the northwest edifice there is a highly degraded adobe wall segment (2.5 m in height)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tresting upon a high revetment (around 1.8 m in height). </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>At the base of the interior rear wall of the northwest edifice, wood bonding materials are still in situ.

This piece of wood\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twas structurally integral to the construction of the adobe-block wall. Along with similar pieces of wood it\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thelped to stabilize the interface between the stone revetment and adobe superstructure. These bonding materials\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlie perpendicular to the axis of the wall and could be extracted with relative ease and with minimal disturbance\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto the structure. The sample tested yielded a conventional radiocarbon age of circa 565 to 705 CE, corresponding\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto the late protohistoric and early imperial periods. Given the relatively small diameter of the piece of wood\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tassayed, it is not likely to have been cut down too many years before it was used in the construction of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"popular\">Rula Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ru la mkhar</span>. It is likely, therefore, an\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\texcellent indicator of when the northwest edifice was either founded or rebuilt. It is possible that rather than\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\treflecting the establishment of the installation, the chronometric evidence may be applicable to a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\treconstruction process. In any event, adobe-block superstructures are relatively easy to demolish and rebuild.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf a foundation date is indicated, it may well reflect chronological values pertinent to the southeast/lower\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsector of the facility. Both sectors of <span class=\"popular\">Rula Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ru la mkhar</span> share the same ensemble of constructional traits (system of revetting, adobe-block upper\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcourses, random-rubble limestone fabric, and close structural integration). </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The raising of <span class=\"popular\">Rula Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ru la mkhar</span> is probably\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlinked to the agricultural land-base of its environs, which must have provided the cereal surpluses needed to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsupport an elite monumental and social infrastructure (regional and interregional trade notwithstanding). We can\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbe quite confident, then, that a viable farming community existed at <span class=\"popular\">Rula Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ru la mkhar</span> until at least the seventh or eight century CE. The genesis of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tagriculture in the area, however, is likely to date to a much more remote period, given the generally more\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconducive environmental conditions of earlier times and the inherent economic and strategic significance of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\textensive arable lands. If <span class=\"popular\">Rula Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ru la mkhar</span> was\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfounded before circa 630 CE, it was built as part of an indigenous (<span class=\"popular\">Zhang Zhung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Zhang zhung</span>) polity. A later foundation date (circa 630 to 750 CE) would indicate\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat this facility arose within the pan-Tibetan imperium before the reign of King <span class=\"popular\">Tri Songdetsen</span><span class=\"scholar\">Khri srong lde btsan</span>. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Shrine","index":9,"parent_index":6,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Southeast of the residential complex, 15 m lower in elevation, there are the remains of a cubic shrine (1.7 m x\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1.7 m).
