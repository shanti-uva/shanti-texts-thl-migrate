The funerary site is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsituated on the lower sandy flanks of a hill known as <span class=\"popular\">Kyanggyuk Ri</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rkyang rgyug ri</span>.

Most of the 187 funerary structures documented are built deeply into\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe hillside. These are rectangular and sub-rectangular structures, most or all of which were built with flat\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttops, however, many of the tops are now highly eroded and inclined along the axis of the slope. The funerary\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstructures sit at different elevations, often in long rows, creating the effect of terraced slopes. The two longer\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsides of the funerary structures usually run perpendicular to the axis of the slope. An indeterminate portion of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\teach terraced structure is concealed underground. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Although the south flank of each superstructure is exposed, the east and west walls progressively disappear into\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe slopes. In a few specimens, only the surface of the north/rear wall is visible, while in many others it is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnon-existent or completely underground. Erosion, vandalism and geomorphologic changes have all conspired to make\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tit difficult to know how tall the funerary structures actually were at the time of construction. The south/forward\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tflanks of the large funerary structures (60 m&sup2; to 117 m&sup2;) range in height between 1.5 m to 3 m. In the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmedium-sized specimens (25 m&sup2; to 60 m&sup2;), the forward flank is 50 cm to 1.2 m in height. The bulk of the forward\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tflank is comprised of a steep earthen embankment. In some specimens, the forward flank consists of a dry-mortar\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trandom-rubble masonry wall (30 cm to 1 m in height), which may or may not be shored up by an earthen embankment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn some of the large specimens, the forward flank appears to have been built in three tiers, the lower two of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhich are made of earth. In small specimens (4 m&sup2; to 25 m&sup2;) the forward flank ranges from flush with the slope to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t50 cm in height. Distinctive single-course walls line the rims of many funerary structures. These consist of two\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tparallel lines of stones (spaced 75 cm to 1.3 m apart) that run along the forward edge and two sides of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstructures. On the east and west rims of the funerary structures, these parallel courses of stones were laid at\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe same elevation. On the forward/south side of the funerary structures, the two parallel stone courses are\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\teither set at the same elevation or placed at a vertical distance of 20 cm to 50 cm from one another. In the few\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tspecimens where north walls are visible, these are generally inset 20 cm to 30 cm below the upper slope. It seems\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlikely that in many other specimens, the rim of the north wall was once visible, only to be subsequently engulfed\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tby the failure of the slopes. Smaller specimens tend to have less elaborate stonework than their larger\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcounterparts, but they are constructed in the same general manner. None of the funerary structures of <span class=\"popular\">Karkhuk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dkar khug</span> appear to have had superficial structural\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\telements within their outer walls. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Pieces of white granite (<span class=\"popular emph\">dzengkar</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">&rsquo;dzeng dkar</span>) primarily 20 cm to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t60 cm in length (stones 1 m or more long are occasionally found) went into the construction of the <span class=\"popular\">Karkhuk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dkar khug</span> funerary structures. Most stones are unhewn but\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthere may also be examples that have shaped exterior faces. Very few of the funerary structures are well aligned\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin the cardinal directions; their aspect being more determined by the exigencies of the local topography. It is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnot apparent if these structures served exclusively as tombs or if some were employed in other funerary functions\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tas well. It is reported by local sources that when some of the structures were opened during the Chinese Cultural\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRevolution, they were found to have painted stone walls. <span class=\"popular\">Karkhuk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dkar khug</span> is divided into west and east sectors.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>There is local belief that the structures of <span class=\"popular\">Karkhuk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dkar khug</span> represent the ruins of an ancient Buddhist monastery (some sources say it was established by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKing glang dar ma and destroyed by the jun gar\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMongols of the 18th century CE).

According to <span class=\"popular\">Barta</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bar tha</span> residents, in the early 1970s many stones were extracted from the structures of <span class=\"popular\">Karkhuk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dkar khug</span> in order to build enclosures used for growing\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgrass. This pilferage is said to have substantially damaged the site.

The high proportion of fragmentary structures in the west sector\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\talso indicates that the site has undergone adverse geomorphologic changes. As the west sector slopes are less\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsevere, the forward elevations of the funerary structures tend to be less than in the east sector. Certain\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstructures barely protrude above the ground surface.

Funerary structure FS1 is a large specimen situated on the western-most edge of the <span class=\"popular\">Karkhuk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dkar khug</span> site (31&deg; 33.750&#900; N. lat. / 91&deg; 24.200&#900; E.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlong). Unlike most of its counterparts in the west sector, it is still sited on stable ground.

Its east side probably stood about 2 m above the adjoining slope. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttop of the structure now inclines slightly to the west. On the east side of FS1 there are three lines of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsingle-course masonry (each about 3 m in length): one on the rim and two on the flanks. These three lines of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstones are spaced about 60 cm from one another. The embankment below these walls may have been shored up with\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmasonry at one time. On the south side of the top of the structure there are three single courses of stones,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\teach separated by about 1.5 m. The side walls are up to 65 cm in height and are comprised of as many as four\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvertical courses of stones laid flat. Old red stone plaques inscribed with the <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma &#7751;i</span> mantra have been placed on FS1.
