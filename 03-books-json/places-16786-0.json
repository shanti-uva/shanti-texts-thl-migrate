The funerary site is situated on the lower sandy flanks of a hill known as <span class=\"popular\">Kyanggyuk Ri</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rkyang rgyug ri</span>. The site is in plain view of <span class=\"popular\">Neri Tsongön</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gnas ri mtsho sngon</span> (Sacred Mountain Blue Lake) (4520 m to 4600 m), which is situated 10 km to the southeast. <span class=\"popular\">Karkhuk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dkar khug</span> is also in direct view of the burial grounds of <span class=\"popular\">Gönro</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dgon ro</span> (D-75) and <span class=\"popular\">Ronglung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rong lung</span> (D-76). The slopes of <span class=\"popular\">Kyanggyuk Ri</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rkyang rgyug ri</span> have a southern exposure and a 15° to 30° gradient. Most of the 187 funerary structures documented are built deeply into the hillside. These are rectangular and sub-rectangular structures, most or all of which were built with flat tops, however, many of the tops are now highly eroded and inclined along the axis of the slope. The funerary structures sit at different elevations, often in long rows, creating the effect of terraced slopes. The two longer sides of the funerary structures usually run perpendicular to the axis of the slope. An indeterminate portion of each terraced structure is concealed underground. </p> <p>Although the south flank of each superstructure is exposed, the east and west walls progressively disappear into the slopes. In a few specimens, only the surface of the north/rear wall is visible, while in many others it is non-existent or completely underground. Erosion, vandalism and geomorphologic changes have all conspired to make it difficult to know how tall the funerary structures actually were at the time of construction. The south/forward flanks of the large funerary structures (60 m² to 117 m²) range in height between 1.5 m to 3 m. In the medium-sized specimens (25 m² to 60 m²), the forward flank is 50 cm to 1.2 m in height. The bulk of the forward flank is comprised of a steep earthen embankment. In some specimens, the forward flank consists of a dry-mortar random-rubble masonry wall (30 cm to 1 m in height), which may or may not be shored up by an earthen embankment. In some of the large specimens, the forward flank appears to have been built in three tiers, the lower two of which are made of earth. In small specimens (4 m² to 25 m²) the forward flank ranges from flush with the slope to 50 cm in height. Distinctive single-course walls line the rims of many funerary structures. These consist of two parallel lines of stones (spaced 75 cm to 1.3 m apart) that run along the forward edge and two sides of the structures. On the east and west rims of the funerary structures, these parallel courses of stones were laid at the same elevation. On the forward/south side of the funerary structures, the two parallel stone courses are either set at the same elevation or placed at a vertical distance of 20 cm to 50 cm from one another. In the few specimens where north walls are visible, these are generally inset 20 cm to 30 cm below the upper slope. It seems likely that in many other specimens, the rim of the north wall was once visible, only to be subsequently engulfed by the failure of the slopes. Smaller specimens tend to have less elaborate stonework than their larger counterparts, but they are constructed in the same general manner. None of the funerary structures of <span class=\"popular\">Karkhuk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dkar khug</span> appear to have had superficial structural elements within their outer walls. </p> <p>Pieces of white granite (<span class=\"popular emph\">dzengkar</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">’dzeng dkar</span>) primarily 20 cm to 60 cm in length (stones 1 m or more long are occasionally found) went into the construction of the <span class=\"popular\">Karkhuk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dkar khug</span> funerary structures. Most stones are unhewn but there may also be examples that have shaped exterior faces. Very few of the funerary structures are well aligned in the cardinal directions; their aspect being more determined by the exigencies of the local topography. It is not apparent if these structures served exclusively as tombs or if some were employed in other funerary functions as well. It is reported by local sources that when some of the structures were opened during the Chinese Cultural Revolution, they were found to have painted stone walls. <span class=\"popular\">Karkhuk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dkar khug</span> is divided into west and east sectors.</p> "},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":" <p>There is local belief that the structures of <span class=\"popular\">Karkhuk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dkar khug</span> represent the ruins of an ancient Buddhist monastery (some sources say it was established by King glang dar ma and destroyed by the jun gar Mongols of the 18th century CE). The funerary identity of the site is acknowledged by the placement of a sky burial (<span class=\"popular emph\">jator</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">bya gtor</span>) site on the summit of <span class=\"popular\">Kyanggyuk Ri</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rkyang rgyug ri</span>. This sky burial site was exclusively used by the jing ger (Chinggis Khaan) clan and its affines. <span class=\"popular\">Barta</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bar tha</span>elders report that this sky burial site has not been used for at least three generations (since the time of the local chieftain <span class=\"popular\">Jingger Gyazing</span><span class=\"scholar\">Jing ger rgya zing</span>).<a href=\"#n67\" name=\"nb67\" class=\"note\">67</a> Other clans in the region used a sky burial site known as <span class=\"popular\">Semo Mentang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Se mo sman thang</span> located to the west of <span class=\"popular\">Kyanggyuk Ri</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rkyang rgyug ri</span>. According to <span class=\"popular\">Barta</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bar tha</span> residents, in the early 1970s many stones were extracted from the structures of <span class=\"popular\">Karkhuk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dkar khug</span> in order to build enclosures used for growing grass. This pilferage is said to have substantially damaged the site. It is also reported that sometime in the 1990s, a group of local residents excavated a particularly large structure at the bottom east edge of the east sector. It is said that those who participated in the dig became ill. This has dissuaded others from conducting similar illicit excavations at <span class=\"popular\">Karkhuk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dkar khug</span>. Local sources report that circa 2000, a Tibetan newspaper team passing through the area issued a cursory report on <span class=\"popular\">Karkhuk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dkar khug</span>. The association of <span class=\"popular\">Karkhuk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dkar khug</span> with the jing ger clan could possibly signify that the funerary structures were built by the Mongols (early 13th century CE), or that an earlier burial ground (from the early historic period?) was requisitioned as a means to increase the social prestige of a leading clan in the region. </p> "},{"title":"Site elements","index":6,"parent_index":2,"body":" "},{"title":"West sector","index":7,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p>The west sector slopes are generally less steep than those of the east sector. The west sector terrain is very barren and sandy, indicating that it has suffered the effects of flooding and other geomorphologic changes since the construction of the funerary structures. The high proportion of fragmentary structures in the west sector also indicates that the site has undergone adverse geomorphologic changes. As the west sector slopes are less severe, the forward elevations of the funerary structures tend to be less than in the east sector. Certain structures barely protrude above the ground surface. In some specimens the forward walls have rounded corners. </p> <p>Let us begin the survey of the west sector with a detailed description of one of the more important funerary structures, FS1. Funerary structure FS1 is a large specimen situated on the western-most edge of the <span class=\"popular\">Karkhuk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dkar khug</span> site (31° 33.750΄ N. lat. / 91° 24.200΄ E. long). Unlike most of its counterparts in the west sector, it is still sited on stable ground. FS1 is one of the only structures at <span class=\"popular\">Karkhuk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dkar khug</span> to face in an eastern rather than southern direction. Its east side probably stood about 2 m above the adjoining slope. The top of the structure now inclines slightly to the west. On the east side of FS1 there are three lines of single-course masonry (each about 3 m in length): one on the rim and two on the flanks. These three lines of stones are spaced about 60 cm from one another. The embankment below these walls may have been shored up with masonry at one time. On the south side of the top of the structure there are three single courses of stones, each separated by about 1.5 m. The side walls are up to 65 cm in height and are comprised of as many as four vertical courses of stones laid flat. Old red stone plaques inscribed with the <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma ṇi</span> mantra have been placed on FS1.
