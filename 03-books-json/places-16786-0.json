According to <span class=\"popular\">Barta<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Bar tha<\/span> residents, in the early 1970s many stones were extracted from the structures of <span class=\"popular\">Karkhuk<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Dkar khug<\/span> in order to build enclosures used for growing grass. This pilferage is said to have substantially damaged the site. It is also reported that sometime in the 1990s, a group of local residents excavated a particularly large structure at the bottom east edge of the east sector. It is said that those who participated in the dig became ill. This has dissuaded others from conducting similar illicit excavations at <span class=\"popular\">Karkhuk<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Dkar khug<\/span>. Local sources report that circa 2000, a Tibetan newspaper team passing through the area issued a cursory report on <span class=\"popular\">Karkhuk<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Dkar khug<\/span>. The association of <span class=\"popular\">Karkhuk<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Dkar khug<\/span> with the jing ger clan could possibly signify that the funerary structures were built by the Mongols (early 13th century CE), or that an earlier burial ground (from the early historic period?) was requisitioned as a means to increase the social prestige of a leading clan in the region. <\/p> "},{"title":"Site elements","index":6,"parent_index":2,"body":" "},{"title":"West sector","index":7,"parent_index":6,"body":null},{"title":"East sector","index":8,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p>The upper portion of the east sector is steeper than the lower portion but the terrain is in better condition.
