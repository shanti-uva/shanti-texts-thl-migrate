The terrain is somewhat sloping, rocky and sandy. <span class=\"popular\">Dechok M&ouml;ndur</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bde mchog mon dur</span> consists of no less than 25 funerary structures, most\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof which have been thoroughly vandalized. These heavily built structures are of significant size and cultural\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\timportance. Sadly, in the last few years, they have been almost completely destroyed by looters. The site appears\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto be comprised of quadrate structures (double-course enclosures?) elevated 50 cm to 1 m above the surrounding\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tground level. All the structures are built of uncut variable-length pieces of gray granite. Many larger stones (50\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcm to 1 m long) were used in their construction. These funerary structures were excavated both recently and in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmore distant past. These excavations were almost certainly conducted for the recovery of valuable artifacts. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsystematic, large-scale nature of the recent excavations can only have been the work of a highly organized and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twell-equipped team.
