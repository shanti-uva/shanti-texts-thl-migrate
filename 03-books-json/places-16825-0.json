The site is situated on the forward flanks of a series of prominences that rise above the valley bottom. The views from <span class=\"popular\">Dechok Möndur</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bde mchog mon dur</span> are restricted to the local stretch of the <span class=\"popular\">Senge Tsangpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sengge gtsang po</span> valley. The terrain is somewhat sloping, rocky and sandy. <span class=\"popular\">Dechok Möndur</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bde mchog mon dur</span> consists of no less than 25 funerary structures, most of which have been thoroughly vandalized. These heavily built structures are of significant size and cultural importance. Sadly, in the last few years, they have been almost completely destroyed by looters. The site appears o be comprised of quadrate structures (double-course enclosures?) elevated 50 cm to 1 m above the surrounding ground level. All the structures are built of uncut variable-length pieces of gray granite. Many larger stones (50 cm to 1 m long) were used in their construction. These funerary structures were excavated both recently and in the more distant past. These excavations were almost certainly conducted for the recovery of valuable artifacts. The systematic, large-scale nature of the recent excavations can only have been the work of a highly organized and well-equipped team. The destruction of the site appears to have been carried out openly and with impunity. </p>",
