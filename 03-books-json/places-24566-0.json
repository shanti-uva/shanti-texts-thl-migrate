In 1969 there were no roads for motor transport to or from the Bazaar; and the nearest dry-weather airfield was some 28 miles to the south in Surkhet. Although a number of small stone pillars attested to the earlier Malla influence in the area, the Bazaar's most prominent structure was a large hexagonal-shaped fort built in the late 18th century in the wake of the expansion of the Gorkha state. In its compact settlement pattern atop a 4500' ridge, the Bazaar contrasted with the surrounding countryside of widely dispersed houses and farms. Bazaar dwellings contained a resident population of just under a thousand persons, and a third as many temporarily-resident civil servants and military personnel from outside the area. The majority of permanent residents were from castes at the lower end of the ritual hierarchy; many were Newars originally from the Kathmandu Valley who predominated among the Bazaar's shopkeepers and traders.Â </p> <p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Lionel Caplan's study sought to trace the relationships over time between </span>these different categories of bazaariya (\"market people\") and between them and peasants in the surrounding countryside.
