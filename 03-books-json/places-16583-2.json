This hanging valley is an effluent of the <span class=\"popular\">Dzong Chu</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdzong chu</span> in which runs the east side of the <span class=\"popular\">Tisé</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ti se</span> pilgrim’s circuit. The <span class=\"popular emph\">do khang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rdo khang</span> is situated on the right side of the valley about 30 m above its floor. This valley is constricted by the steep flanks of the mountains and does not enjoy the panoramic views of other <span class=\"popular emph\">do khang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rdo khang</span> sites at <span class=\"popular\">Tisé</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ti se</span>. Its hidden location must have afforded <span class=\"popular\">Menlapo Drang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sman bla pho brang</span> (North) a considerable degree of privacy and security, ideal for religious practice. It was built on a moderately angled boulder-strewn slope and is aligned in the cardinal directions. This structure is of the same type found at other locations around <span class=\"popular\">Tisé</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ti se</span> (B-9, B-10, B-20, B-21, B-22, B-33, and B-42). The most important of these, <span class=\"popular\">Nyenpo Ri Dzong</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gnyan po ri rdzong</span> (B-22) and <span class=\"popular\">Gyang Drak</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gyang grags</span> (B-9), are likely to have been the archaic political nerve centers of <span class=\"popular\">Tisé</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ti se</span>. </p> "},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":" <p>None was collected.</p> "},{"title":"Site elements","index":6,"parent_index":2,"body":" <p> <span class=\"popular\">Menlapo Drang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sman bla pho brang</span> (North) measures 8.7 m (east-west) x 5.5 m (north-south), not including what may have been a forward vestibule, which adds 1.5 m to its north-south dimension. The orange climax lichen growing on the dissolving walls shows that they have been standing for a very long time. No mortar was detected in the solidly built random-rubble walls. Corbels and sheathing (up to 1.5 m long) lie scattered in the rubble. Variable-length stones (12 cm to 90 cm) were carefully selected for their regular exterior faces. Walls have been reduced to 1 m to 1.5 m in height. The entranceway to the edifice is located in the outer east wall. The south-facing structure contained two rows of rooms built at almost the same elevation: north/rear and south/forward. There were probably three rooms in each row. The rear wall of the building is set only 40 cm below the uphill slope. The forward wall, which probably enclosed a vestibule, has been nearly obliterated. In the west room of the south row there is a large corbel in place. On the east side of the building there are the remains of a walled enclosure (6.5 m x 4.5 m). This must have been an open-air domestic space. </p>  "}]}
