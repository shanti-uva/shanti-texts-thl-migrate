The orange climax lichen growing on the dissolving walls shows that they have been standing for a very long time. No mortar was detected in the solidly built random-rubble walls. Corbels and sheathing (up o 1.5 m long) lie scattered in the rubble. Variable-length stones (12 cm to 90 cm) were carefully selected for heir regular exterior faces. Walls have been reduced to 1 m to 1.5 m in height. The entranceway to the edifice is located in the outer east wall. The south-facing structure contained two rows of rooms built at almost the same elevation: north\/rear and south\/forward. There were probably three rooms in each row. The rear wall of the building is set only 40 cm below the uphill slope. The forward wall, which probably enclosed a vestibule, has been nearly obliterated. In the west room of the south row there is a large corbel in place. On the east side of the building there are the remains of a walled enclosure (6.5 m x 4.5 m). This must have been an open-air domestic space. <\/p>  "}]}
