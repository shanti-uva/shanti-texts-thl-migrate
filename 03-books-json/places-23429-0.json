It was founded in 1847 by sPa ston gYung drung nam\n                        bzang, who was of the holy sPa lineage. The sPa is one of the six sacred\n                        families: Bru, Zhu, gShen, sPa, rMe&rsquo;u and Khyung. The Bon Sources and some\n                        other historical documents give reasons why the sPa family is important:</p>\n\n                     <p>lHa bu sPa ba spa thog, a son of Sangs po and Chu lcam, was born in heaven.\n                        He descended to earth from rTsa gsum lha and preached Bon. Then he went to\n                        Zhang zhung rNam rgyal lha rtse. From there he went to the Crystal Cave on\n                        Mount Ti se where he practised meditation on the tutelary deity Me ri for\n                        three years and so attained the divine body and was called Kri smon lcags\n                        kyi bya ru can. At that time, in Zhang zhung, people used to say, &ldquo;In the\n                        sky the divine son is beautiful. On earth the king is great.&rdquo; Lha bu&rsquo;s\n                        descendants were ancestors of the sPa family and some of its members held\n                        the position of prelate at the court of kings of Tibet.</p>\n\n                     <p>sPa ston Khyung &rsquo;bar, who had obtained spiritual power of mysticism in the\n                        latter stage of Bon development, demonstrated his acquired abilities.

After that, the centre of activities of the\n                        sPa family was shifted from west to east. All Bonpo sources agree that the\n                        monastery in Hor Ye tha constituted the most important monastic centre of\n                        the sPa lineage.</p>\n\n                     <p>Later, sPa ston gYung drung bstan pa &rsquo;brug grags had other assembly halls\n                        built, with passages around them, on the three storeys of a building that\n                        had one hundred pillars. He also had the following religious objects\n                        erected: a stupa of bDud &rsquo;dul sgra sgrags, and statues of sTon pa rdzogs sku\n                        and rNam par rgyal ba, all gilt-bronze works. They were as high as a\n                        three-storey building. There were many small images as well.

He\n                        also had a large number of new religious objects built in the gTso bzhi\n                        temple.</p>\n\n                     <p>The Bonpo doctrine was spread widely through the setting up of a flawless\n                        preaching school, under the system of the monastic tradition of sMan ri\n                        (No.1) and gYung drung gling (No.2) as well as the teachings of Shar rdza,\n                        the one who attained the &ldquo;rainbow-body&rdquo;.
