RS1 appears to have been fairly well aligned in the cardinal directions, and measures 7.3 m (east-west) x 5.6 m (north-south). The disintegrated rear\/north wall is set as much as 70 cm into he uphill slope. Only in the northwest corner of the structure is there a coherent wall segment surviving. <\/p> "},{"title":"Residential Structure RS2","index":9,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p>Residential structure RS2, an L-shaped structure, is well aligned in the compass points and measures 7.6 m (east-west) x 4 m (north-south) (30.81&#900; \/ 13.72&#900; \/ 4780 m). The forward\/south wall of RS2 is elevated about 1 m above the slope. On the west side (shorter arm of the L) of RS2 there is a single room (2.7 m x 1.9 m x 1.9 m). A portion of the roof is still intact, but the rear wall of this room has been reduced to 1.1 m or less in height. There is a niche in the upper northwest corner of the west unit room (30 cm x 50 cm x 50 cm). There appears to have been an entranceway between the west unit room and the forward east unit of RS2. <\/p> <p>The east unit of RS2 is divided into forward\/south and rear\/north sections. The forward portion was either a room or an open area (3.9 m x 2.9 m). The entranceway appears to have been in the east (perhaps accessing a landing or anteroom) but the walls have been largely obliterated (up to 90 cm high). The rear section of the east unit of RS2 consists of a single room (1.7 m x 2 m x 1.7 m). The entranceway to this room is in the south (opens to the forward room) and about half its roof is intact. Next to the entranceway there is a small window opening (30 cm x 20 cm) and two niches in the rear wall. The forward wall of the east unit rear room has an exterior height of 2 m. The rear\/north wall of this room is 1.7 m high, 1.2 m of which is underground. The roof assembly adds another 50 cm to the height of the structure. Being set below the ground on the north side protected the east unit rear room from the severe winds originating in this direction. The well-insulated niches in the rear wall may even have been used for cold storage in the summer months. <\/p> "},{"title":"Residential Structure RS3","index":10,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p>Residential structure RS3 is also generally aligned in the cardinal directions and measures 11m (east-west) x 4.2 m (north-south) (30.80&#900; \/ 13.74&#900; \/ 4760 m). RS3 is divided into three units: east, central and west. The east unit appears to have been comprised of a landing or small courtyard (interior dimensions: 2.5 m x 2.3 m). On this side of RS3, the forward\/south wall, including the revetment, has a maximum height of 2.3 m. The central unit (interior dimensions: 2.5 m x 2.3 m) of RS3 had a rear room and perhaps a forward one as well. The forward wall of the central unit is now only 1.1 m high, not including its disintegrated revetment. The rear\/north wall of the central unit has a maximum interior height of 1.3 m. The west unit of RS3 consists of a forward\/south room (1.7 m x 1.7 m) and a rear\/north room (2.5 m x 1.5 m). Much of the roof of the west unit is intact. The wall between the forward room and rear room of the west unit is flush with the ground on the south side and 1.3 m high on the north\/inner side. The entranceway to the west unit forward room opens to the forward portion of he central unit. The rear\/north wall of the west unit rear room is partly masonry and partly hewn from the slope. As the floor-to-ceiling height in this space was only around 1.2 m, it probably did not serve as a habitation. <\/p> "},{"title":"Residential Structure RS4","index":11,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p>Residential structure RS4 has an L-shaped plan and is not well aligned in the compass points (coordinates not available). The maximum dimensions of this structure are 6 m (south wall) x 5.5 m (east wall). There is a single room in the west unit (1.7 m x 1.5 m) with a west-facing entranceway (1.1 m x 70 cm). A bit of the roof still clings to the east corner of this room. The walls of the west unit room reach a maximum height of 1.2 m (forward) and 1.5 m (rear). There are also two east unit rooms in RS4: forward\/south and rear\/north. The south wall and east wall of the east unit forward room (2.9 m x 2.5 m) are leveled. It is not certain whether this space was an actual room, a landing or both. The partially intact entranceway (1.2 m x 60 cm) to the east unit rear room (1.6 m x 1.8 m) is in the north wall of the forward east room. In the back of the east unit rear room here is a large recess measuring 2.1 m (east-west) x 80 cm (north-south) x 90 cm in height. The opening in this recess measures 70 cm x 70 cm. The function of this highly sheltered semi-subterranean space is not immediately apparent. Perhaps it was used for ritual purposes. The forward wall of the east unit rear room is 1.7 m in height and the rear wall is up to 1.2 m in height. Only a couple of corbels are still in situ. The current floor-to-ceiling height of the east unit rear room is 1.2 m. <\/p> "},{"title":"Residential Structure RS5","index":12,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p>Residential structure RS5 is fairly well aligned in the cardinal directions and measures 8 m (east-west) x 5.4 m (north-south) (30.85&#900; \/ 13.80&#900; \/ 4780 m). The forward wall of this structure is now only around 1 m in height. There is a single northwest room (2 m x 1.9 m x 1.3 cm) with three corbels and one bridging stone in place. Immediately south of the northwest room there is a leveled area, either the remains of a smaller room or an open area. There were probably one or two rooms east of this space but the scanty structural evidence is inconclusive. <\/p> <hr class=\"footnote-divider\" \/> "},{"title":"Notes","index":13,"parent_index":0,"body":null}]}
