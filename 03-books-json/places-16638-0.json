At its closest point the 12-km long <span class=\"popular\">Tsodo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mtsho do</span> is situated 5 km from the mainland. The highest spot (5000 m) on the island is in the east, rising high above the ancient residential site. The settlement of <span class=\"popular\">Tsodo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mtsho do</span> was smaller and architecturally less impressive han its island counterparts in <span class=\"popular\">Namtso</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gnam mtsho</span> or da rog mtsho, and this despite the great size of the island. There are five all-stone corbelled structures on <span class=\"popular\">Tsodo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mtsho do</span>, which on the average are more modestly built than those on other Upper Tibetan islands. These constitute the highest elevation ancient lake settlement in Upper Tibet.<a href=\"#n119\" name=\"nb119\" class=\"note\">119</a> They are found in a sheltered valley on the south side of the island. This valley has wide sandy benches and several still functioning corrals. The <span class=\"popular emph\">do khang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rdo khang</span> were established on a steep rocky slope that encloses the north side of the valley. They all have a southern aspect and look clear across the east side of <span class=\"popular\">Ngangla Ringtso</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ngang la ring mtsho</span> to the meridian range separating <span class=\"popular\">Runtor</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ru ’thor</span> from <span class=\"popular\">Rishi</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ri shi</span>. The all-stone corbelled edifices have random-rubble texture walls (50 cm to 70 cm thick) containing variable-length uncut blocks (up to 70 cm). Primarily a hard, bluish fine-grained rock was used in construction. Seams were filled with a white clay-based mortar, much of which has disappeared with time. Roof appurtenances are 80 cm to 1.3 m in length. The modest construction of these <span class=\"popular emph\">do khang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rdo khang</span> is typified by heir smaller size (two to four rooms in each), thinner walls (50 cm to 70 cm), lower ceilings, and the absence of spacious courtyards. </p><p>Reportedly, there are no permanent sources of potable water on <span class=\"popular\">Tsodo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mtsho do</span> and, unlike <span class=\"popular\">Namtso</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gnam mtsho</span>, <span class=\"popular\">Daroktso</span><span class=\"scholar\">Da rog mtsho</span> or <span class=\"popular\">Langa Tso</span><span class=\"scholar\">La lnga mtsho</span>, the water of <span class=\"popular\">Ngangla Ringtso</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ngang la ring mtsho</span> is not potable.<a href=\"#n120\" name=\"nb120\" class=\"note\">120</a> The presence of an ancient settlement of all-stone corbelled residences on the island indicates that perennial sources of water must once have been present on <span class=\"popular\">Tsodo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mtsho do</span>.<a href=\"#n121\" name=\"nb121\" class=\"note\">121</a> Yet, potable water may have always been a factor limiting the development of the island community, given its relatively small size. Some <span class=\"popular emph\">Ombu</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">’om bu</span> (tamarisk) and <span class=\"popular emph\">drama</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">gra ma</span> grows on the island, valuable sources of wood. More than 100 goats and sheep and a few dozen yaks could potentially be kept on permanent basis on <span class=\"popular\">Tsodo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mtsho do</span>. Such flocks could have provided the ancient residents with a significant source of food and other products. Insular natural resources aside, <span class=\"popular\">Tsodo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mtsho do</span> is likely to have been one of the most important sedentary centers in the region with relatively wide-ranging cultural and economic ramifications.

It consists of two rectangular masonry structures of the type found on other Upper Tibetan islands. They are made from a bluish metamorphic (?) rock of variable length (to 90 cm long). These ceremonial structures were established according to localized frames of reference and are not aligned in the cardinal directions. The larger of the two specimens (6 m x 3.4 m) has been leveled to 50 cm or less in height. The smaller specimen (1.8 m x 2 m x 1 m) is situated 4.3 m to the north. Its walls have a random-rubble texture and a hard, white clay-based mortar in the joints. The top section of the smaller shrine appears to have been rebuilt (it has a much cruder presentation than the rest of the structure). This monument is no longer actively used. Beside this structure there is a stone slab 1 m long with the <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma ṇi </span>mantra carved twice.

The forward portion was either a room or an open area (3.9 m x 2.9 m). The entranceway appears to have been in the east (perhaps accessing a landing or anteroom) but the walls have been largely obliterated (up to 90 cm high). The rear section of the east unit of RS2 consists of a single room (1.7 m x 2 m x 1.7 m). The entranceway to this room is in the south (opens to the forward room) and about half its roof is intact. Next to the entranceway there is a small window opening (30 cm x 20 cm) and two niches in the rear wall. The forward wall of the east unit rear room has an exterior height of 2 m. The rear/north wall of this room is 1.7 m high, 1.2 m of which is underground. The roof assembly adds another 50 cm to the height of the structure. Being set below the ground on the north side protected the east unit rear room from the severe winds originating in this direction. The well-insulated niches in the rear wall may even have been used for cold storage in the summer months. </p>",

On this side of RS3, the forward/south wall, including the revetment, has a maximum height of 2.3 m. The central unit (interior dimensions: 2.5 m x 2.3 m) of RS3 had a rear room and perhaps a forward one as well. The forward wall of the central unit is now only 1.1 m high, not including its disintegrated revetment. The rear/north wall of the central unit has a maximum interior height of 1.3 m. The west unit of RS3 consists of a forward/south room (1.7 m x 1.7 m) and a rear/north room (2.5 m x 1.5 m). Much of the roof of the west unit is intact. The wall between the forward room and rear room of the west unit is flush with the ground on the south side and 1.3 m high on the north/inner side. The entranceway to the west unit forward room opens to the forward portion of he central unit. The rear/north wall of the west unit rear room is partly masonry and partly hewn from the slope. As the floor-to-ceiling height in this space was only around 1.2 m, it probably did not serve as a habitation. </p>",

The partially intact entranceway (1.2 m x 60 cm) to the east unit rear room (1.6 m x 1.8 m) is in the north wall of the forward east room. In the back of the east unit rear room here is a large recess measuring 2.1 m (east-west) x 80 cm (north-south) x 90 cm in height. The opening in this recess measures 70 cm x 70 cm. The function of this highly sheltered semi-subterranean space is not immediately apparent. Perhaps it was used for ritual purposes. The forward wall of the east unit rear room is 1.7 m in height and the rear wall is up to 1.2 m in height. Only a couple of corbels are still in situ.
