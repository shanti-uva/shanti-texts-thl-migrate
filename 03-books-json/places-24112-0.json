It is from this town that the Rinpung government successfully wrested control of Central Tibetan from the Pakmodru and began a century of conflict between \u00dc and Tsang.\u00a0<\/p><p>Earlier the Pakmodru leader Drakpa Gyeltsen (<span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">grags pa rgyal mtshan<\/span>, 1377-1440) had appointed Namkha Gyeltsen (<span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">nam mkha\u2019 rgyal mtshan<\/span>) as the local leader of the Rinpung fortress and estates, located to the west of Zhikats\u00e9. Namkha Gyeltsen took the name Rinpung as his family name, and from this the government took its name. When Drakpa Gyeltsen died in 1440 (or 1442 according to some sources), the young nephew of the Rinpung leader, Norbu Zangpo (<span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">nor bu bzang po<\/span>, 1403-1466), was appointed head of the Pakmodru.\u00a0 Norbu Zangpo took full advantage of his influence at the Pakmodru court, and by 1434 had successfully shifted power from Pakmodru to Rinpung. In 1435 the Rinpung family moved its administration from the family seat of Rinpung to the fortress of Samdrupts\u00e9 (<span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">bsam grub rtse<\/span>), located in present day Zhikats\u00e9. This was to remain the center of the Rinpung Government through its reign. During the 1430s Rinpung began to take control of other estates throughout Tsang. Relations between Rinpung and Pakmodru continued to be strained despite, or perhaps because of the fact that Rinpung family members now controlled both the Pakmodru central government and the expanding Rinpung estates.<\/p><p>In the wake of the power Norbu Zangpo\u2019s death in 1466, his younger brother Tsoky\u00e9 Dorj\u00e9 (<span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">mtsho skyes rdo rje<\/span>, 1452-1510), took control of Pakmodru. This was an important step for the Rinpungpa, for Tsoky\u00e9 Dorj\u00e9 favored the Rinpung factions of the family. This increasing family control laid the ground for Norbu Zangpo\u2019s grandson, D\u00f6ny\u00f6 Dorj\u00e9 (<span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">don yod rdo rje<\/span>, 1462-1512, the son of K\u00fcnzangpa [<span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">kun bzang pa<\/span>]) to significantly increase Rinpung\u2019s control of Tsang in 1480, and launch a major offensive against the Lhasa area in 1481. In 1485 he attacked the Gyants\u00e9 polity, but was defeated when Pakmodru and Lhasa allied with Gyants\u00e9. In 1492 Dony\u00f6 Dorj\u00e9 successfully took control of several districts around Lhasa, and in 1498 he held such control over Lhasa that he was able to forbid Gelukpa monks and religious leaders from attending the Lhasa Great Prayer festival, control of which he had given to the Karmapa Sect. The ban against the Gelukpa was to last until 1517.<\/p><p>The sixteenth century saw the rise of a new power from within the ranks of the Rinpung administration. Zhingshakpa Tseten Dorj\u00e9 (<span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">zhing shag pa tshe brtan rdo rje<\/span>, mid-sixteenth century) was appointed stable minister at Zhikats\u00e9. Through a series on intrigues Tseten Dorj\u00e9 rallied the existing Pakmodru factions against the Rinpung family, and eventually took full control of the Samdrupts\u00e9 fortress. With him the Rinpung Government comes to an end, and the Tsangpa Government begins.<\/p><p>Almost nothing is currently known about the administrative system of the Rinpung Government, nor is much known about the extent of its land holdings. In 1830 Rinpung remained an administrative district within the Ganden Government, and it may be possible to get a rough sense of its former extent through examination of its nineteenth century status. The reason for the current lack of knowledge is simple; as is the case with so many of the pre-modern polities in Tibet, there is no almost extant literature that describes the Rinpung Government. Scholars are thus left to piece together an outline of its shape and scope through scattered references in the literary evidence, while what documentary evidence there might be remains inaccessible.<\/p>","title":"The Rinpung Government"},{"title":"Sources","index":1,"parent_index":0,"body":"<p>Dung-dkar blo-bzang \u2019phrim-las [sic]. <em>The Merging of Religious and Secular Rule in Tibet<\/em>.
