Zhu sKye se chen po and Zhu sGrol ba gshen rgyal initiated the way of expounding scriptures and practising Bonpo teachings, and because of this the monastery became very famous. At the time of the Fifth Dalai Lama (1617-1682), Zhu bsTan ’dzin nyi rgyal was recognized as one of the high-ranking lamas in Tibet. It is said that Zhu bsTan ’dzin nyi rgyal once had an audience with the Manchu emperor and the Manchu court gave him a large number of gifts.</p><p>The monastery owned thirteen estates, which were donated by the Tibetan government. It is said that there were once, in its heyday, East, West and Middle hostels (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">khang tshan</span>) with three hundred monks in the monastery. Before 1959 there were sixty monks. It was totally destroyed during the Cultural Revolution, and now only its ruins remain. About 1984 Tshe ring rdo rje, a descendant of the Zhu family, organized a few households to restore the hermitage called gYu ’brang phyug mo. Later, a small temple was gradually built, but the site of the monastery has been moved to another place.</p>",
