Every village\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof <span class=\"popular\">Zarang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Za rang</span> (save for <span class=\"popular\">Kaprak</span><span class=\"scholar\">Skab rag</span>) was once guarded by such strongholds. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsiting, design and physical condition of the ruins indicate that <span class=\"popular\">Riti Gang Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ri lti sgang mkhar</span> was an archaic cultural facility. The site occupies a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstrategic position directly above the village at the head of the <span class=\"popular\">Riti</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ri lti</span> valley. The summit on which the stronghold was planted is readily defendable and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdifficult to outflank. This summit is 79 m in length (with an east-west axis). The amount of rubble strewn about\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tindicates that significant structures were once found here, but their size and configuration cannot be\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tascertained. Only fragments of highly eroded revetments have endured (up to 1.5 m in height). Small vestiges of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trevetments that lined the southern rim of the summit are intact. These are probably the remains of a once\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tformidable circumvallation. Very little of the defensive walls that encircled the stronghold are detectable on the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnorth side of the summit. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Structures of <span class=\"popular\">Riti Gang Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ri lti sgang mkhar</span> were\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tprimarily constructed of blue limestone and to a lesser degree of brown sandstone. The revetments have a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trandom-rubble texture. No mortar was detected in the seams. Blocks used in construction (some may have been hewn\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinto shape) are mostly 10 cm to 50 cm in length. About half the arable landholdings of <span class=\"popular\">Riti Gang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ri lti sgang</span> (current population: 38) are being worked.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMore intensive economic activity and a larger population were probably associated with the construction and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tresidency of <span class=\"popular\">Riti Gang Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ri lti sgang mkhar</span>. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The villagers of <span class=\"popular\">Riti</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ri lti</span> consider <span class=\"popular\">Riti Gang Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ri lti sgang mkhar</span> an ancient stronghold.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Site elements","index":6,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"West sector","index":7,"parent_index":6,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The west sector is 35 m in length.
