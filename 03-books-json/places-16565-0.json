It is likely to have flourished in the same general time period as the other <span class=\"popular emph\">khar<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mkhar<\/span> of <span class=\"popular\">Zarang<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Za rang<\/span>. Every village of <span class=\"popular\">Zarang<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Za rang<\/span> (save for <span class=\"popular\">Kaprak<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Skab rag<\/span>) was once guarded by such strongholds. The siting, design and physical condition of the ruins indicate that <span class=\"popular\">Riti Gang Khar<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Ri lti sgang mkhar<\/span> was an archaic cultural facility. The site occupies a strategic position directly above the village at the head of the <span class=\"popular\">Riti<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Ri lti<\/span> valley. The summit on which the stronghold was planted is readily defendable and difficult to outflank. This summit is 79 m in length (with an east-west axis). The amount of rubble strewn about indicates that significant structures were once found here, but their size and configuration cannot be ascertained. Only fragments of highly eroded revetments have endured (up to 1.5 m in height). Small vestiges of revetments that lined the southern rim of the summit are intact. These are probably the remains of a once formidable circumvallation. Very little of the defensive walls that encircled the stronghold are detectable on the north side of the summit. <\/p> <p>Structures of <span class=\"popular\">Riti Gang Khar<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Ri lti sgang mkhar<\/span> were primarily constructed of blue limestone and to a lesser degree of brown sandstone. The revetments have a random-rubble texture. No mortar was detected in the seams. Blocks used in construction (some may have been hewn into shape) are mostly 10 cm to 50 cm in length. About half the arable landholdings of <span class=\"popular\">Riti Gang<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Ri lti sgang<\/span> (current population: 38) are being worked. More intensive economic activity and a larger population were probably associated with the construction and residency of <span class=\"popular\">Riti Gang Khar<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Ri lti sgang mkhar<\/span>. <\/p> "},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":" <p>The villagers of <span class=\"popular\">Riti<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Ri lti<\/span> consider <span class=\"popular\">Riti Gang Khar<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Ri lti sgang mkhar<\/span> an ancient stronghold.<\/p> "},{"title":"Site elements","index":6,"parent_index":2,"body":" "},{"title":"West sector","index":7,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p>The west sector is 35 m in length. It terminates in an almost vertical rise of 10 m along the ridgeline. The western extremity of the summit is the lowest and widest (15 m) part of the site.

The west side of the east sector summit is 4 m to 5 m in width. The ridgeline widens in the east to 10.5 m and then narrows to 4.5 m on its east end (the highest point of the summit). There are four or five revetment segments that run perpendicular to the axis of the summit. These are situated at different elevations and likely formed the base of a stepped line of buildings. Below the west half of the east sector, small wall fragments extend along the 45° slope for a distance of 23 m from the summit. It would appear that buildings once stood on this slope as well. <\/p>  "}]}
