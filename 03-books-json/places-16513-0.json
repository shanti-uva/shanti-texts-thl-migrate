It was probably composed of five rooms or interconnected buildings (21.5 m x 7 m). A foundation on the north side of BG2 is 1.5 m thick. This masonry mass must have had a special function.

This collection of structures was built at two or more different levels on the ridge-top (38 m x 5 m to 8.5 m). Revetments attain a height of 1.2 m. A wall at he southeast corner of BG3 is 1.5 m in height, about 50% of which is freestanding.

A small hanging valley intervenes between the upper complex and middle complex formations. In this valley, a highly dissolved residential structure (5 m x 9 m) was built against the base of he upper formation. Very little of even the foundations of the buildings that once comprised the middle complex remain intact. They were founded on a level shelf endowed with a natural bulwark of stone to the south. The density of structures at this location is unclear. On the east end of the middle complex summit there is a ruined house almost certainly built after the fortress was in ruins. Along the north edge of the summit are the vestiges of a defensive wall that enclosed the shelf. <\/p> "},{"title":"Lower complex","index":14,"parent_index":6,"body":null}]}
