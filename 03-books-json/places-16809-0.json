The concentration of archaic funerary sites in <span class=\"popular\">Reco<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Re co<\/span>is extremely noteworthy. This density of funerary sites, however, does not positively correlate to archaic residential monuments in the region.

It sits on a bench that is situated about 40 m above the valley floor. FS6 is a substantially built structure that is generally aligned in the cardinal direction. The entire structure is prominently elevated above the surrounding errain. The forward wall (up to 70 cm high) is composed of two to four vertical courses of granite masonry. Stones in the base of FS6 are up to 1.4 m in length. On top of the structure there is a small hollow, the remains of an excavation in all probability. There may be two smaller funerary structures in close proximity of FS6, but their structural signatures are no longer legible. Also, 5.8 m southeast of FS6, three upright slabs form a rectangular structure whose fourth side is open. The shorter slabs of the two side walls are 60 cm and 70 cm in length and are slightly elevated above the ground surface. The slab of the long side of the structure is 1 m in length and projects 20 cm above the surface. This trilithic structure must have had specialized funerary ritual functions. FS6 is in plain view of the settlement of <span class=\"popular\">Reco<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Re co<\/span>. It is reported that various funerary structures in the vicinity were dismantled during the construction of the homogenous modern settlement. Fortunately FS6 was too inaccessible to be destroyed in this fashion. <\/p> "},{"title":"Affiliated sites","index":13,"parent_index":2,"body":null}]}
