   "body": "<p> <span class=\"popular\">Omlung</span><span class=\"scholar\">’Om lung</span> is a series of funerary sites located in a valley of the same name. The funerary structures of <span class=\"popular\">Omlung</span><span class=\"scholar\">’Om lung</span> are situated on sandy benches on both sides of the valley. They are built of uncut light-colored variable-length pieces (up to 80 cm long) of granite. Reportedly, there are at least three more funerary structures on the left side of the <span class=\"popular\">Omlung</span><span class=\"scholar\">’Om lung</span> valley (situated roughly 3 km down valley of funerary structure FS5), which were not surveyed. Some barley cultivation is still carried out in <span class=\"popular\">Omlung</span><span class=\"scholar\">’Om lung</span> but not to the same extent as in <span class=\"popular\">Rama</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ra ma</span> (D-96).</p>
<p>There are other funerary structures scattered around the main and side valleys of <span class=\"popular\">Reco</span><span class=\"scholar\">Re co</span>, which were not surveyed due to time limitations. The concentration of archaic funerary sites in <span class=\"popular\">Reco</span><span class=\"scholar\">Re co</span>is extremely noteworthy. This density of funerary sites, however, does not positively correlate to archaic residential monuments in the region. This suggests that <span class=\"popular\">Reco</span><span class=\"scholar\">Re co</span> region was largely devoted to funerary functions. The funerary usage of <span class=\"popular\">Reco</span><span class=\"scholar\">Re co</span> may have catered to the needs of areas in <span class=\"popular\">Rutok</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ru thog</span> with well developed archaic residential installations. </p>

FS1 is located on the right/east side of the valley. This rectangular structure is elevated around 70 cm above the surrounding, sloping sandy terrain. The entire structure is covered in large stones embedded in the surface. Some loose stones are scattered on top of this platform-like structure as well. There are no coherent wall segments extant. Right in the middle of FS1, a stone pen (5.5 m across) composed of the same type of rocks was erected. The walls of this pen are about 1.5 m in height. It is filled with sand up to 60 cm from the top of its walls. The function of this pen is enigmatic. It appears to be a subsequent modification to FS1, as it is built in a rudimentary manner and could not have survived intact for too long. </p>

It sits on a bench that is situated about 40 m above the valley floor. FS6 is a substantially built structure that is generally aligned in the cardinal direction. The entire structure is prominently elevated above the surrounding errain. The forward wall (up to 70 cm high) is composed of two to four vertical courses of granite masonry. Stones in the base of FS6 are up to 1.4 m in length. On top of the structure there is a small hollow, the remains of an excavation in all probability. There may be two smaller funerary structures in close proximity of FS6, but their structural signatures are no longer legible. Also, 5.8 m southeast of FS6, three upright slabs form a rectangular structure whose fourth side is open. The shorter slabs of the two side walls are 60 cm and 70 cm in length and are slightly elevated above the ground surface. The slab of the long side of the structure is 1 m in length and projects 20 cm above the surface. This trilithic structure must have had specialized funerary ritual functions. FS6 is in plain view of the settlement of <span class=\"popular\">Reco</span><span class=\"scholar\">Re co</span>. It is reported that various funerary structures in the vicinity were dismantled during the construction of the homogenous modern settlement. Fortunately FS6 was too inaccessible to be destroyed in this fashion. </p>
