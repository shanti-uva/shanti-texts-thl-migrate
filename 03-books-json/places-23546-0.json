When I visited it in August 1997, I left from sTeng chen Monastery and\n                        had to cross the river on a wooden raft consisting of four tree trunks. From\n                        the opposite bank it took me about half an hour on horseback via a village\n                        to reach the monastery which is located at the foot of a mountain.</p>\n\n                  \n\n                  \n\n                     "},{"title":"3. History","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n\n                     <p>According to oral tradition, the monastery was founded by gYung drung rnam\n                        rgyal with the financial support of Gling tshang, one of the leading\n                        families in Derge, around eight hundreds years ago. Later the monastery was\n                        destroyed by a flood, which according to popular belief, was caused by the\n                        local deities who were offended by the monastery&rsquo;s gold roof. Following this\n                        episode it was rebuilt by Nyag rong bKra shis dge legs, a disciple of Shar\n                        rdza bKra shis rgyal mtshan. It became a branch of sMon rgyal Monastery\n                        (No.136). In the 15th Rab byung (1867-1926), it became a branch of rDza\n                        sTeng chen Monastery and has remained as such until now. </p>\n\n                     <p>The monastery is headed by abbots. Since Shar rdza is a very isolated and\n                        poor area, it took several generations to complete the monastery&rsquo;s\n                        reconstruction. Nyag rong bKra shis dge legs, who undertook the monastery&rsquo;s\n                        reconstruction, built an assembly hall (&rsquo;du khang), and two sanctuaries for\n                        the atonement (sgrub khang). The second abbot, Phun tshogs blo gros, made a\n                        large statue callled lHa chen, and painted the murals within the sgrub\n                        khang. The third abbot, Tshul khrims dar rgyas, built a kitchen and rebuilt\n                        another sgrub khang, and also introduced a system allowing the monastery to\n                        finance four monks at a time to do two-year tantric practice in the sgrub\n                        khang. The fourth abbot, Shes rab bstan &rsquo;dzin, travelled throughout Nyag\n                        rong and Khyung po to give teachings and collect funds for the monastery\n                        with which he built thirty small buildings for sheltering prayer-wheels\n                        (&rsquo;khor chung), a small ma ti mantra wheel, and four large cauldrons (mtshogs\n                        zangs) and other cooking utensils for the monastery. The fifth abbot, rTogs\n                        ldan bsTan &rsquo;dzin blo gros, commissioned copper statues of the gNas brtan bcu\n                        drug (the &ldquo;sixteen direct disciples of the Buddha&rdquo;), Gu ru mtshan brgyad\n                        (the &ldquo;eight aspects of Padmasambhava&rdquo;), and gilded statues of the Buddhas of\n                        the Three Ages. The sixth abbot, rTogs ldan Zla ba rgyal mtshan, travelled\n                        to central Tibet whence he returned with the collected works of mNyam med\n                        Shes rab rgyal mtshan (1356-1415), two conches and three statues. The\n                        seventh abbot, dBang li, a disciple of Shar rdza bKra shis rgyal mtshan,\n                        repaired the assembly hall and built a wheel containing more than one\n                        hundred million ma ti mantras (stong &rsquo;khor). He is said to have passed away\n                        in his &ldquo;rainbow body&rdquo; (&rsquo;ja&rsquo; lus). The eighth abbot, bsKal bzang bstan &rsquo;dzin,\n                        built a gold stupa (gser gdung mchod rten) and acquired more than forty\n                        volumes of tantric texts for the monastery. rTogs ldan Mi pham rnam rgyal\n                        and gYung drung nyi ma, commissioned statues of the thirty-five Buddhas\n                        (ltung gshags so lnga) and furnished the monastery with other religious\n                        relics. The tenth abbot, Nam mkha&rsquo; grags pa, acquired the complete works of\n                        Kun grol &rsquo;ja&rsquo; tshon snying po and gTer ston gSang sngags gling pa, and more\n                        than forty thangkhas for the monastery. Shes rab phun tshogs and Nam mkha&rsquo;\n                        ye shes, established a philosophical college (bshad gwra). The twelfth\n                        abbot, Tshul khrims dbang rgyal, founded a printing house containing more\n                        than a thousand printing blocks. As a very rare exception, there were dKon\n                        mchog, dBang ldan, mThar phyin and rGyal mchog: dKon mchog was a very\n                        learned master and introduced a ritual of bDe &rsquo;dus sgrub mchod which the\n                        monastery performs on the 15th day of the 5th month; dBang ldan was also\n                        mgon khang bla ma. mThar phyin was the head of the bshad grwa at the same\n                        time; rGyal mchog was a gCod pa, one who practices mainly gCod. There were\n                        three fourteenth abbots bsTan pa dkon mchog, Tshe ring dpal bzang and Nyi ma\n                        grags pa, until the mid-20th century. </p>\n\n                     <p>The monastery suffered from destruction in the 1980s, it was rebuilt by bSod\n                        nams blo gros, dBra sras bSod nams lha rgyal and dBra sras Yid bzhin dbang\n                        rgyal, the last three abbots of the monastery. </p>\n\n                     <p>The above information was provided by the Zer &rsquo;phro dgon pa&rsquo;i lo rgyus by\n                        rDza pa Tshe ring &rsquo;gyur med which unfortunately does not give dates or\n                        details of the abbots&rsquo; life stories.</p>\n\n                  \n\n                  \n\n                     "},{"title":"4.
