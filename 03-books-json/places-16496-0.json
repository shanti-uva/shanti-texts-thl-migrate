On the west side of the west summit structure there is a cobble revetment 2 m to 2.5 m in height. Below this revetment there is a 2.2-m wide level area created by a cobble retaining wall, 50 cm to 2 m in height. Below this wall there is another level area (1.5 m in width), surrounded by a cobble wall a maximum of 2.2 m in height. These two masonry terraces probably supported small buildings at one time. On another terrace (3 m x 5 m), located below the west side of the summit edifice, there is a 65-cm high adobe wall segment. At just 20 cm thick, this adobe fragment has undergone a tremendous degree of dissolution. The terrace it sits on is bound by a masonry wall footing totaling 20 m in length. Adjacent to this terrace, on a small pinnacle, there is a finely built foundation that must have supported an edifice no larger than 3.5 m x 3.5 m. The construction of an edifice on this tiny pinnacle is in keeping with design attributes of archaic residential sites. <\/p> "},{"title":"Other ruins","index":9,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p>Directly above the village of <span class=\"popular\">Shangpa<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Shang pa<\/span> there is another archaeological site locally referred to as a &lsquo;castle&rsquo; (<span class=\"popular emph\">khar<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mkhar<\/span>).
