In the \"Historical buildings in Lhasa\" table at the back of the book (pp. 165-172), buildings of the \"Summerhouse\" type are designated with the letter \"K\" in the building type column. In the THL Place Dictionary, when a building has this feature type and the<em> Lhasa Atlas<\/em> is given as the source, it means that the building was designated with a \"K\" in the <em>Lhasa Atlas<\/em> table.<br \/><br \/>This building type is described as follows:<br \/><br \/>\"<em>K. Summerhouse<\/em>. Tsomonling Drokhang (252).<br \/><br \/>\"The summerhouse emerged as an urban phenomenon towards the end of the 19th century, when noble families built summer houses in the open landscape, away from their main residences in the increasingly dense, warm and smelly old town. Gradually, many well-established families sold or rented out their residence in town and moved permanently to the new 'suburbs'. Located in a large garden, the original summerhouse has a generous south-facing window front, a separate kitchen and servant buildings. A monastery often has a summerhouse for the abbot in an adjacent garden\" (p. 61).<br \/><br \/>Source:<br \/><br \/>Larsen, Knud and Amund Sinding-Larsen. <em>The Lhasa Atlas: Traditional Tibetan Architecture and Townscape<\/em>.
