The view\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnorth is cut off by the <span class=\"popular\">Tseda</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rtse mda&rsquo;</span>mountain. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tterrain is turf-covered, sandy and gently sloping. There are three or four funerary enclosures at <span class=\"popular\">Tseda</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rtse mda&rsquo;</span> that are probably best classified under the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\theaped-stone wall typology. They variously exhibit irregular forms, tops inset below the upper slope, gentle slope\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgradients, and traces of piled stones walls; traits associated with heaped-stone wall enclosures. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The funerary structures of <span class=\"popular\">Tseda</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rtse mda&rsquo;</span> also have\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmorphological qualities associated with the terraced tombs of the far eastern <span class=\"popular\">Jangtang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Byang thang</span> (elevated forward flanks, flat tops and low elevation amorphous\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twalls). The terraced tombs, however, appear to have had a weaker influence on the design and construction of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"popular\">Tseda</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rtse mda&rsquo;</span> than the heaped-stone wall enclosures.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNonetheless, only subsurface investigations can definitively chart the typological affinities of the <span class=\"popular\">Tseda</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rtse mda&rsquo;</span> funerary structures. The perimeter walls (around\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t70 cm thick) are generally in a very poor state of preservation, and have been reduced to only 10 cm to 20 cm\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\theight. Although the surface of the structures now inclines in conformity with the slope gradient, it is likely\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat they were once completely level. These funerary structures were built of variable-length (10 cm to 60 cm\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlong) pieces of red volcanic rock. Heaped-stone wall enclosures are widespread to the west all the way across the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"popular\">Jangtang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Byang thang</span>. Such structures are closely\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tassociated with the ancient <span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span> in the oral\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttradition of the region.
