Directly south and 150 m below the site is the sacred freshwater lake, <span class=\"popular\">Mukyu Tso</span><span class=\"scholar\">Smu skyu mtsho</span>/<span class=\"popular\">Mokyu Tso</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rmo khyu mtsho</span> (Bevy of Grandmothers Lake). To the east is the <span class=\"popular\">Ngorang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sngo rang</span> valley and to the west is a mountain known as <span class=\"popular\">Gonyis</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mgo gnyis</span> (Two Heads). The view north is cut off by the <span class=\"popular\">Tseda</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rtse mda’</span>mountain. The terrain is turf-covered, sandy and gently sloping. There are three or four funerary enclosures at <span class=\"popular\">Tseda</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rtse mda’</span> that are probably best classified under the heaped-stone wall typology. They variously exhibit irregular forms, tops inset below the upper slope, gentle slope gradients, and traces of piled stones walls; traits associated with heaped-stone wall enclosures. </p> <p>The funerary structures of <span class=\"popular\">Tseda</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rtse mda’</span> also have morphological qualities associated with the terraced tombs of the far eastern <span class=\"popular\">Jangtang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Byang thang</span> (elevated forward flanks, flat tops and low elevation amorphous walls). The terraced tombs, however, appear to have had a weaker influence on the design and construction of <span class=\"popular\">Tseda</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rtse mda’</span> than the heaped-stone wall enclosures. Nonetheless, only subsurface investigations can definitively chart the typological affinities of the <span class=\"popular\">Tseda</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rtse mda’</span> funerary structures. The perimeter walls (around 70 cm thick) are generally in a very poor state of preservation, and have been reduced to only 10 cm to 20 cm height. Although the surface of the structures now inclines in conformity with the slope gradient, it is likely that they were once completely level. These funerary structures were built of variable-length (10 cm to 60 cm long) pieces of red volcanic rock. Heaped-stone wall enclosures are widespread to the west all the way across the <span class=\"popular\">Jangtang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Byang thang</span>. Such structures are closely associated with the ancient <span class=\"popular\">Mön</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span> in the oral tradition of the region. There are no signs that <span class=\"popular\">Tseda</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rtse mda’</span> has been recently disturbed. </p> "},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":" <p>The structures of <span class=\"popular\">Tseda</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rtse mda’</span> are locally referred to as <span class=\"popular emph\">möndo ra</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mon rdo ra</span> (Stone Enclosures of the <span class=\"popular\">Mön</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span>).
