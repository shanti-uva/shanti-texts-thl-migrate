The structure appears to have been aligned in the cardinal directions and to have contained three tiers of rooms. The west half of the building has fared much better than the east side. There seems to have been two rear rooms, which still have several in situ bridging stones. The floor-to-ceiling height in these rear rooms was not less than 1.8 m. There is a niche in the rear wall. In between the rear wall and adjoining cliff there is an intervening closed space that may have been used for storage purposes. On the west side of the middle tier there is an interclose and entranceway accessing the rear rooms. The roof over these structures is still intact. A bit of he stone roof has also persisted over the small forward tier west room as well. <\/p> "},{"title":"Residential Structure RS9","index":17,"parent_index":8,"body":" <p>Residential structure RS9 (5180 m) was constructed on the ridge-top above RS8.
