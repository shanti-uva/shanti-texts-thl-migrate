While the Buddhists undoubtedly occupied this site, it appears to have been founded during the archaic cultural horizon. The adequate shelter offered by these residential structures must have been attractive to <span class=\"popular emph\">Kagyüpa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">bka’ brgyud pa</span> ascetics during their 12th and 13th CE century colonization of <span class=\"popular\">Tisé</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ti se</span>. The <span class=\"popular emph\">do khang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rdo khang</span> generally face in a southwesterly direction and are of the same construction, size, setting, and elevation as those found in the vicinity of <span class=\"popular\">Gyang Drak</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gyang grags</span> monastery (B-9). Typically, rear walls were set deep into the slope, giving the buildings a semi-subterranean aspect. The larger specimens (around 8 m x 12 m) have three tiers of rooms or a forward courtyard and two upper tiers of rooms. Smaller specimens generally have two tiers of rooms. The <span class=\"popular emph\">do khang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rdo khang</span> were robustly and adeptly constructed from uncut and dressed pieces of brown sandstone, 20 cm to 80 cm in length. The random-rubble walls retain traces of the mud-mortar that once filled the joints.</p> <p>All <span class=\"popular emph\">do khang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rdo khang</span> from RS5 to RS15 are in view of <span class=\"popular\">Langa Tso</span><span class=\"scholar\">La lnga mtsho</span> and the Himalaya beyond.

In between the rear wall and adjoining cliff there is an intervening closed space that may have been used for storage purposes.
