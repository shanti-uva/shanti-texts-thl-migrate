After five\n                        generations, Tshul khrims rgyal mtshan was born in the Fire-Dog year\n                        (986A.D.). His father was Ye shes rgyal mtshan and his mother, Zhu bza&rsquo;\n                        gYung drung mtsho.

In accordance with the wishes of his father Ye shes rgyal mtshan,\n                        Ngo zhu Tshul khrims rgyal mtshan founded a monastery at the holy site of\n                        Kha rag, and his family took the name of Kha rag tshang.
