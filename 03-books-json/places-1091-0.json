Bonpo people believed that it was one of the forty-five gathering places (’du gnas) founded by Mu khri bTsan po, the second king of the Yar lung kings in Tibet, and gShen Nam mkha’ snang ba mdog can when they invited hundreds of Bonpo masters from Zhang zhung. Dran pa’i rnam thar g-yung drung gsang mdzod and bKa’ brgyad brgyud<a href=\"#n8\" name=\"nb8\" class=\"note\">8</a> also mentioned Kha rag as one of the ’du gnas of Bon founded in the period of King Mu khri btsan po. </p><p>The history of Kha rag can be divided into two parts: its history as a ’du gnas and later as a dgon pa. As a ’du gnas, it has a long history, and has been regarded as a sacred site from the outset. There are several legendary versions dealing with Kha rag, but they all seem too fantastical to relate here.</p><p>There was a written history of the ’du gnas entitled Kha rag gnas kyi lo rgyus by Gling gshen Mu la blo gros, which might have contained valuble information, and I spent much time looking for it when I visited Khams in the autumn of 1997, but unfortunately I was unable to find it. </p><p>In accordance with the oral tradition recorded by Bya Tshe ring in a history of Kha rag, the founder of Kha rag monsatery was Ngo zhu Tshul khrims rgyal mtshan. His family was originally from Bru sha (Gilgit) and was known as Bru sha rNam sras spyi ring. During King Khri srong lde btsan’s persecution of Bon in the 8th century, Bla klu dbang, a Bonpo master belonging to the Bru sha family fled to the ’Dzin valley in Khams and founded a monastery at Nor bu’i dbu rtse in Khrom stod khams lung east of dDe dge. After five generations, Tshul khrims rgyal mtshan was born in the Fire-Dog year (986A.D.). His father was Ye shes rgyal mtshan and his mother, Zhu bza’ gYung drung mtsho. Since his mother was from Zhu, an ancient and famous family in the history Bon, he was called Ngo zhu Tshul khrims rgyal mtshan. From that time, the family of Bru in Kha rag was known as Ngo zhu Bru tshang. In accordance with the wishes of his father Ye shes rgyal mtshan, Ngo zhu Tshul khrims rgyal mtshan founded a monastery at the holy site of Kha rag, and his family took the name of Kha rag tshang. The lineage ran for forty-eight generations. The first twenty-eight descendants were: </p><ol type=\"1\"> <li>Ngo zhu Tshul khrims rgyal mtshan </li> <li>Nam mkha’ bstan ’dzin</li> <li>bKra shis g-yung drung </li> <li>Phun tshogs dbang rgyal</li> <li>Shes rab rgyal mtshan </li> <li>Kun bzang g-yung drung </li> <li>Phun tshogs rgyal mtshan </li> <li>’Chi med g-yung drung </li> <li>’Chi med blo gsal </li> <li>Rin chen rgyal mtshan </li> <li>bsTan ’dzin gtsug phud </li> <li>Kun dga’ ye shes </li> <li>gYung drung blo gros </li> <li>Shes rab g-yung drung </li> <li>bKra shis rin chen </li> <li>bsKal bzang nor bu </li> <li>gYung drung bstan rgyal</li> <li>Nam mkha’ blo gros </li> <li>’Chi med tshe dbang </li> <li>gYung drung blo gsal </li> <li>Kun bzang bstan ’dzin </li> <li>gYung drung bstan ’dzin </li> <li>bSod nams bkra shis </li> <li>A rten </li> <li>A tshan </li> <li>gSang sngags </li> <li>’Jam dpal blo gros </li> <li>Kun dga’ blo gros </li> </ol><p>In addition to the twenty-eight masters mentioned above, there was a very learned master called gYung drung bstan pa’i rgyal mtshan who belonged to the eighteenth generation of the Kha rag tshang family. He was born in the Fire-Rat year of the 9th Rab byung (1516). His father’s name was sKal bzang nor bu, and his mother’s Ye shes lha ’dzoms. gYung drung bstan pa’i rgyal mtshan founded a monastery called rJes ri at the foot of Mount Bon ri in Kong po where he introduced the practice of the observance of the summer fast (dbyar gnas) and the dgu gtor rite. He also founded a meditation centre (sgrub grwa) in Kha rag lla rgyal rtse mo where he initiated the ritual tradition of mNyam med Shes rab rgayl mtshan. He wrote more than ten volumes of works, but unfortunately very few of them survived. Nam mkha’ blo gros, the 18th master in the line, was born in the Wood-Dragon year of the 9th Rab byung (1556). He received teachings from gYung drung bstan pa’i rgyal mtshan and built a three-storey assembly hall (’du khang). From his time onwards, the hereditary succession of the Kha rag tshang has continued unbroken to this day. </p><p>Kha rag ’Jam dbyangs blo gsal rgyal mtshan (b.1939), the last descendant, took me to monasteries Zla ’od and gTsug ’od near Kha rag Monastery when I was visiting the area in autumn 1997. The system of succession through reincarnation was never adopted in this monastery and the hereditary line of Kha rag tshang is still the head of the monastery.</p>",
