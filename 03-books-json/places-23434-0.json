That is why the monastery is called Klu phug.</p>\n\n                     <p>There was a Tantric establishment called mKhar dmar bla brang founded in\n                        1626 by Khri rgyal rje chen, the twelfth king of the Thirty-nine Tribes of\n                        Hor. He was a tantric practitioner and followed both Bon and &rsquo;Bri gung bKa&rsquo;\n                        rgyud pa traditions. </p>\n\n                     <p>mKhar dmar was situated at a saddle-shaped craggy red hill called Gung lhag.\n                        It was a two-storey building. On the top of the roof it had various emblems\n                        unique to the ancient Bon tradition, such as the perch of birds. In the\n                        centre and at the four corners of the roof there were spears erected and\n                        decorated with yak&rsquo;s hair on their tips, surrounded by deer and wild yak\n                        horns. In the assembly hall on the upper floor there were four pillars and\n                        it was the place where twelve Tantric practitioners gathered together. There\n                        were the following religious objects: clay images of the four-armed sPyan\n                        ras gzigs, sGrol dkar, rNam par rgyal ba and Khri gtsug rgyal ba;\n                        scriptures, including the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">Khams chen</span> in sixteen\n                           volumes<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"> </span>and the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">bDal &rsquo;bum</span> in\n                        twelve volumes; eight stupas made of a mixture of medicine and clay, each of\n                        which was as tall as an arrow. On the west side of the floor there was a\n                        single-pillared meditation room in which Khri rgyal rje chen erected\n                        gilt-bronze statues of Kun bzang rgyal ba &rsquo;dus pa and dBal gsas rngam pa\n                        (this statue still exists) less than a cubit in height. These had been\n                        concealed in the ground at Sham po during the suppression of Bon in Central\n                        Tibet and was rediscovered by rMa ston lHa rgod Shes rab seng ge. Moreover,\n                        there were images of Dran pa nam mkha&rsquo; with his twin sons made of the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">li</span> from Zhang zhung, a span in height (two of these\n                        statues still exist). These were rediscovered in Phyug mo dpal ri by Bon\n                        zhig gYung drung gling pa.</p>\n\n                     <p>In 1786, lHa mkhar bstan rgyal, the elder son of Khri rgyal rje chen, was\n                        enthroned and maintained the mKhar dmar establishment as his father did. He\n                        married gShen bza&rsquo; dPal &rsquo;dzin, a lady of the gShen family. He abandoned his\n                        family&rsquo;s tradition to follow &rsquo;Bri gung bka&rsquo; brgyud and was content to keep\n                        only the Bon tradition. Dpal &rsquo;dzin, the queen, became a nun in her later\n                        life and lived in a cave to devote herself to meditation. Her cave can still\n                        be visited.</p>\n\n                     <p>Tshe ring rab brtan, the son of lHa mkhar, succeeded his father. However, he\n                        was more concerned with politics. He had two tent residences. One of these\n                        two was in sBra chen and it was in this that he used live and it became the\n                        seat of his government.</p>\n\n                     <p>In mKhar dmar, there was lHa bla bsTan pa phun tshogs, who is said to be a\n                        native of rGyal rong. He looked after the tantric establishment (which\n                        usually had twelve tantrists). lHun grub &rsquo;od zer (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">alias</span>\n                        Shang blang Drang srong) of rTing ngu Monastery came to join him and he was\n                        ordained by bsTan pa phun tshogs. So mKhar dmar started having monks in its\n                        midst. lHa bla also established there the ritual practice of the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">Zhi khro dgongs &rsquo;dus</span> according to the New Bon tradition.\n                        This was to be performed in the eighth month every year.</p>\n\n                     <p>Here is an account of how Klu phug Monastery was founded. In 1827 Nyi ma\n                        bstan &rsquo;dzin, the twenty-third abbot of sMan ri Monastery (No.1), travelled\n                        to the region of Hor. He came and stayed in Klu phug Monastery. There he\n                        presided over the ceremony of the enthronement of bsTan &rsquo;dzin dbang grags,\n                        the reincarnation of lHa bla bsTan pa phun tshogs, at mKhar dmar bla brang.\n                        On the same occasion, he encouraged bsTan &rsquo;dzin dbang grags and the twelve\n                        tantrists to take monastic ordination. Klu phug then with its mKhar dmar bla\n                        brang became a real monastery and the abbot gave it the name gShen bstan\n                        gYung drung bde chen gling and wrote a monastic code for it entitled the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">Thar lam them skas</span>, setting out regulations in\n                        accordance with the Bonpo monastic tradition. Not only that, he issued an\n                        edict establishing the monastery as being the first branch of sMan ri in the\n                        region. He entrusted the monastic management to Ma bdud btsan rgyal bzhi,\n                        the Bonpo protectors, and bestowed upon the monastery a large flat bell\n                        discovered in rGyal rong Brag steng and it has been one of the principal\n                        religious objects of this monastery up to the present day.</p>\n\n                     <p>bsTan &rsquo;dzin dbang grags maintained the time-honoured custom of mKhar dmar\n                        bla brang, except that the twelve tantrists were now all monks. He added an\n                        eight-pillared assembly hall and established the commemoration of sTon pa\n                        gShen rab&rsquo;s birthday on the 15th day of the first Tibetan month, and the\n                        performance of the ritual Ma tri bum sgrub on the 15th day of the eighth\n                        month.</p>\n\n                     <p>Later, bsTan pa dar rgyas, a prince of the royal house of Hor, became the\n                        head of the monastery. In his childhood, he was recognized as the\n                        reincarnation of a high lama in rGyal rong. So a number of gifts, including\n                        a copy of the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">Khams chen</span>, written in gold, were\n                        presented to Khri dbang rab brtan, the sixteenth king of Hor, in the hope\n                        that he would permit the child to leave for rGyal rong. However, the king\n                        was powerful enough to hold back the child (his own son) from leaving and\n                        returned the gifts. So bsTan pa dar rgyas eventually decided himself to\n                        become a monk and later ascended the throne of Klu phug Monastery. In\n                        addition to the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">dgu gtor</span> rite, formerly performed by\n                        the Twelve Tantrists, he established a new custom of a complete ritual\n                        practice of the Red Yamantaka (gShin rje gshed dmar). Following this,\n                        religious dances were performed, to which he added new dances: sNang bgyad,\n                        Tshogs &rsquo;cham, and the Yamantaka.</p>\n\n                     <p>rNam rgyal dbang &rsquo;dus, a brother of bsTan pa dar rgyas, entered the\n                        priesthood and succeeded his brother in the monastery, but the seventeenth\n                        king of Hor, Nor bu dbang rgyal, died prematurely, so he had to leave the\n                        monk body and succeed to the throne. As a confession (of having broken the\n                        monastic vows) a two-storey temple with six pillars was build in the\n                        monastery. There were gilt-bronze statues of rNam par rgyal ba and the Four\n                        Principal Buddhas, a span in height. Families of the &rsquo;Brog shog and Bon tha\n                        tribes of the Thirty-seven Tribes of Hor took an oath that they would send\n                        their second son (if there was one) to become a monk. From that point the\n                        monastery began to have many monks.</p>\n\n                     <p>bsTan pa rgyal mtshan, of the royal house of Hor, ascended the monastic\n                        throne. From childhood he was faithful, industrious and intelligent, so that\n                        he became the focus of praise from all the people. He took monastic vows at\n                        the age of thirteen. After that, according to custom, he made offerings to\n                        the three monasteries, including sMan ri. In the presence of sKal bzang nyi\n                        ma, the second abbot of gYung drung gling, he took full ordination. He then\n                        set out on pilgrimage to Mount Ti se and the soul-mountain of Bon in Zhang\n                        zhung and also the lake Ma pang g-yu mtsho. There he made circumambulations\n                        and prostrations.</p>\n\n                     <p>He then returned to his monastery where he had various stupas built,\n                        including a reliquary stupa of a gShen lama in the form of gYung drung bkod\n                        legs and another reliquary stupa of bsTan pa dar rgyas in the form of rNam\n                        rgyal mchod rten made of silver, the height of a person and adorned with\n                        varieties of vivid gems. He had a temple built to house the stupas he had\n                        had made. His main spiritual masters were gTer ston Nam mkha&rsquo; khri khyung of\n                        Zhu and Grub dbang sMon lam rgyal mtshan of Khyung po. gTer ston gYung drung\n                        grags pa of Zhu, who was the prelate of the king Tshe ring rab brtan, made\n                        Mount Brag dkar lha lung, where the monastery is situated, into a sacred\n                        site and established a new custom of circumambulating the sacred hill in the\n                        region.</p>\n\n                     <p>bsTan pa rgyal tshan made copies, by himself, of the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">bKa&rsquo;\n                           &rsquo;gyur</span> and <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">bKa&rsquo;</span>\n                        <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">brten </span> in vermilion ink and had a temple with eight\n                        pillars built to house them. This temple also contained a gilt-bronze statue\n                        of sTon pa gShen rab and a reliquary stupa of Zhu Nam mkha&rsquo; khri khyung the\n                        height of an arrow. An assembly hall was also built, with two storeys and\n                        six long pillars and sixty-six short ones. In the inner sanctuary there was\n                        a complete set of lTung bshags lha &rsquo;khor of gilt-bronze. On the right wall\n                        were murals of the Bya rgyud and sPyod rgyud deities. On the left wall were\n                        the principal deities of the Ye shes and Ye she chen po&rsquo;i rgyud. On the\n                        walls around the upper structure were the Four Principal Buddhas and the\n                        masters who maintained the monastic tradition. On both sides of the door\n                        were Bonpo religious protectors, both male and female. In the front hall\n                        were murals of the eight dPal mgon chen po brgyad, the Four Great Kings and\n                        the local deity lHa dbang dgra &rsquo;dul.</p>\n\n                     <p>This monastery followed the Bru tradition in its activities as exactly as\n                        that of sMan ri Monastery: in the eighth month, the ritual of Khro bo, and\n                        in the third month that of Phur pa, finishing with a whole day&rsquo;s dance\n                        performance.</p>\n\n                     <p>In 1912 the Thirty-nine Tribes of Hor came under the control of the Manchu\n                        officials resident in Tibet and then, later, the Tibetan government began to\n                        rule over the tribes. This Tibetan (dGe lugs pa) rule over the region soon\n                        had an adverse effect on the Bonpo monasteries.</p>\n\n                     <p>Then Sangs rgyas bstan &rsquo;dzin, a Hor lama, took care of the mKhar dmar Bla\n                        brang residence. sGo ston Nyi ma rgyal mtshan succeeded him. The latter was\n                        born in 1937 at lHa thog in sDe dge, in a family of the sKam lineage. He\n                        later became the head of Klu phug Monastery.
