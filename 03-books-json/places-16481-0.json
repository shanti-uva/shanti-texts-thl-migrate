This comprises the vestiges of an approximately 50 m long wall set in a narrow ravine, which is squeezed between two steep limestone slopes. As his site has no open vistas, the relatively secret and sheltered location may have been used to garrison troops or store supplies. The area between the manmade wall and formation is only around 2 m wide. Potentially, this space could have been covered with tarpaulins to produce temporary shelters. <\/p> "},{"title":"Central west complex","index":9,"parent_index":6,"body":null},{"title":"West complex","index":10,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p>The west complex is located directly below the steep south face of the central west complex.

A little to the west and at a slightly higher elevation there is another defensive wall (18 m long) that also appears to have once enclosed a shelf, which is now obscured by rock fall deposits. <\/p> <hr class=\"footnote-divider\" \/> "},{"title":"Notes","index":11,"parent_index":0,"body":" <div class=\"footnote\"> <a name=\"n29\" \/> <a href=\"#nb29\" class=\"note\"> [29] <\/a> The GPS coordinates given in this work (in 1\/10, 1\/100 and 1\/000 of a minute (&#900;) of latitude and longitude) are raw figures that have not been calibrated through the application of base station measurements.

The dimensions of some structures can only be approximately determined because they do not readily lend themselves to measurement. In some cases, structures are partially obscured by soil or rubble, or sections are missing, rendering measurement difficult. Uncertainties may also arise in reference to the interface between manmade structures and the natural errain. This has the effect of creating more or less arbitrary baseline measurements. <\/div>  "}]}
