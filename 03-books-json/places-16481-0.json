The ancient fortifications are situated on\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsubsidiary summits of the west half of the approximately 5300-m high Sky\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFortress formation. The installation enjoys good views to the west and north and, in some places, to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe southwest as well. Its defensive capability was certainly focused in these directions as Sky Fortress affords no protection from or advance notice of attack\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom the east. Sky Fortress consists of a broad network of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdry-mortar random-work defensive walls lacing the upper flanks of an eponymous limestone mount. The ramparts\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tappear to have been less than 2 m in height, and were constructed from uncut pieces of limestone up to 1.2 m in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlength. The northern and western orientation of the site supports the oral tradition that military incursions took\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tplace from these directions. The ramparts, staggered at various levels across Sky Fortress, must have provided the defenders with significant vertical and lateral\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmobility, allowing the rock formation to function as an integrated defensive feature. In recent years <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma &#7751;i</span> mantras have been carved into the limestone walls of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tformation, reflecting the sacred nature of the locale. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>According to local legend, the Tibetan epic hero <span class=\"popular\">Ling Gesar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gling ge sar</span> came to the Sky Fortress region to battle\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe king of <span class=\"popular\">Takzik</span><span class=\"scholar\">Stag gzig</span>, King of Wealth (<span class=\"popular emph\">Nor Gi Gyelpo</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">nor gyi rgyal po</span>).
