The site is named lha mo <span class=\"popular emph\">drukmo</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">'brug mo</span>, the wife of the epic hero <span class=\"popular\">Ling Gesar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gling ge sar</span>. The ancient fortifications are situated on subsidiary summits of the west half of the approximately 5300-m high Sky Fortress formation. The installation enjoys good views to the west and north and, in some places, to he southwest as well. Its defensive capability was certainly focused in these directions as Sky Fortress affords no protection from or advance notice of attack from the east. Sky Fortress consists of a broad network of dry-mortar random-work defensive walls lacing the upper flanks of an eponymous limestone mount. The ramparts appear to have been less than 2 m in height, and were constructed from uncut pieces of limestone up to 1.2 m in length. The northern and western orientation of the site supports the oral tradition that military incursions took place from these directions. The ramparts, staggered at various levels across Sky Fortress, must have provided the defenders with significant vertical and lateral mobility, allowing the rock formation to function as an integrated defensive feature. In recent years <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma ṇi</span> mantras have been carved into the limestone walls of the formation, reflecting the sacred nature of the locale. </p>",

On the east side of the saddle a wall seems to have spanned the 11-m wide base of a natural archway. This wall has been reduced to 7 m in length, and is a maximum of 1.5 m in height and 1.2 m in width. There are smaller structural traces found underneath and on top of the arch. Also on the saddle are four small limestone outcrops, with a total of at least six ruined structures each around 9 m² in area and 1.5 m or less in height. Called <span class=\"popular\">Gesar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ge sar</span>’s incense brazier (<span class=\"popular emph\">sangkhang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">bsang khang</span>), these structures must have functioned as surveillance posts or donjons. There may have been a rampart wall along the north rim of the central west complex saddle but not enough remains to make a determination.
