Then it was moved to another site but the reason and precise time of this change remain unknown. According to one short account of the monastery’s history (rGyal zhing dgon gyi lo rgyus, 8 folios, MS and anonymous), it was founded by the master Bya btang Nam mkha’ rgyal mtshan in the 10th Rab byung (1567-1626), and later, because there was no Sources of drinking water in the vicinity, Khyung ’khor sMon lam tshul khrims, the master at that time, moved the monastery to a new place. The new monastery had nine columns and was named rGyal ba bkra shis. The same account mentions three other masters of this lineage, bSod nams rnam rgyal, Kun bzang rnam rgyal and ’Chi med, but their dates and life stories are not mentioned. In the 19th century, Bya btang Dri med ’od zer offered the monastery a piece of land known as Zhing stong thang on which the present monastery was built. While the monastery was being built, the people heard a dragon in the sky and thus the monastery was named rGyal zhing ’brug grags. It was consecrated by Shar rdza bKra shis rgyal mtshan in the early 20th century. It was partially destroyed during the Cultural Revolution and rebuilt in the nineteen-eighties. The old assembly hall still stands and contains some 177 sq m of original murals.</p> "},{"title":"4.
