Gonjo was centered in present-day Gonjo County, Chamdo (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">chab mdo<\/span><\/em>) Prefecture, TAR.<\/p><p>As with the founding of Lingtsang (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ling tshang<\/span><\/em>), the polity of Gonjo began when Ch\u00f6gyel Pakpa (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">chos rgyal \u2019phags pa<\/span><\/em>) appointed the head lama of the region to be the leader of one of the three newly created districts (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">chol kha<\/span><\/em>, <em><span class=\"chinese\" title=\"Type ID here\">xuanwei si<\/span><\/em>) \u5ba3\u6170\u53f8 that comprised the territory ruled by the Sakya (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">sa skya<\/span><\/em>) hegemon.

T\u00f6nts\u00fcl and his successors also bore the title of \u201cgreat chief\u201d (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">dpon chen<\/span><\/em>; \u5ba3\u6170\u4f7f\u90fd\u5143\u5e05 <em><span class=\"chinese\" title=\"Type ID here\">xuanwei shi duyuanshuai<\/span><\/em>), a monastic title of the Sakya state, and are referred to as such in Tibetan sources.<\/p><p>The biographies of the fourth and fifth Karmapas make several mentions of dealings with the chief of Gonjo. This Karmapa later met the Yongle emperor in 1407 and told him that the current monk-chief of Gonjo could be relied upon to help keep open the trade routes between China and central Tibet. The Yongle emperor thereby appointed the Gonjo chief \u00d6zer Namkha (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">\u2019od zer nam mkha\u2019<\/span><\/em>) one of eight \u201creligious kings\u201d (\u6cd5\u738b <em><span class=\"chinese\" title=\"Type ID here\">fawang<\/span><\/em> or \u6559\u738b <em><span class=\"chinese\" title=\"Type ID here\">jiaowang<\/span><\/em>) and gave him the personal title Prince Who Protects the Doctrine (\u62a4\u6559\u6559\u738b <em><span class=\"chinese\" title=\"Type ID here\">hujiao wang<\/span><\/em>). \u00d6zer Namkha died in 1414 and his nephew inherited the title.<\/p><p>After the latter\u2019s death, the Ming lost interest in Gonjo and discontinued the title. Two-hundred years later the polity lost some of its land to a new regional kingdom. An early historical document about the founding of the Deg\u00e9 kingdom in the late 1630s states that the new polity conquered four communities belonging to Gonjo, which at that time was ruled by a woman (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">dpon mo<\/span><\/em>). Eventually all of Gonjo was integrated into Deg\u00e9. Today the site of the old Gonjo polity is more or less contained within Gonjo County, Chamdo Prefecture, TAR.<\/p>","title":"An Overview of G\u00f6ngyo"}]}
