It consists of six prominent outcrops and adjoining areas that hosted scores of buildings\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcontaining hundreds of rooms. The fairly dense agglomeration of structures covers an area of no less than 30,000\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tm&sup2;, on the left side of the <span class=\"popular\">Gyug&uuml;l</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rgyu mgul</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvalley. Intestines Neck Castle is dominated by six outcrops,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnatural rock formations. Most of the buildings have degraded to crumbling wall footings and piles of rubble, but\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthere are sufficient surviving walls, especially on the outcrops, to illustrate the importance of the site. Once\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsupporting a population of many hundreds, only a small handful of people now reside north of Intestines Neck Castle. The wide shelf east of the ruins was at one\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttime farmed and this zone of cultivation probably extended north over a distance of more than 2 km to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpresent-day settlement.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The structures are mainly made of mud-mortared random-work brown metamorphic stone and light-colored cobbles.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMostly small stone blocks (15 cm to 40 cm), some of which were hewn flat on their exterior sides, were used in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconstruction. The largest building stones are 80 cm in length. Greatly deteriorated adobe-block (mud-brick)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcourses surmount some of the stone walls. Structural evidence indicates that the buildings were constructed with\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twooden roofs. On the northern edge of the site there are over one dozen ruined mud-brick a type of shrine. These Buddhist religious monuments may have been\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\terected to neutralize negative influences emanating from the site. An archaic cultural identity for Intestines Neck Castle is suggested by:</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ol type=\"1\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Its highly marginal place in the local oral tradition. </li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>The hazardous status of the site (<span class=\"popular\">ka nyenpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bka' gnyan po</span>).</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>The absence of prayer flags or other signs of the contemporary veneration of the ruins or its\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdeities.</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>The lack of buildings with obvious monastic ground plans. </li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>The prominent use of stone for construction and the high degree of integration with the parent\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tformations.</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Its unusual position atop six outcrops. </li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ol>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>According to residents of <span class=\"popular\">Dawa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mda' ba</span> township,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIntestines Neck Castle was a large, ancient settlement of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe <span class=\"popular\">Singpa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sing pa</span> (generic term for invaders\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcoming from the northwest).
