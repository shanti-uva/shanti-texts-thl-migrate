On the west side it is flanked by a ravine. Due to the presence of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmany rocky mounds and depressions the surface of the site is undulating. Stones of erstwhile structures are\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tscattered everywhere but there are no coherent walls left. The archaeological dispersion (170 m x 55 m) covers the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tentire ridge-top and appears to represent what was once a large settlement. During recent informal excavations\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thuman bones and ceramic shards have been recovered from the site. Shallow excavations have taken place all over\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"popular\">Jangru Ding</span><span class=\"scholar\">Byang ru sdings</span> to collect stones for\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlocal construction projects.
