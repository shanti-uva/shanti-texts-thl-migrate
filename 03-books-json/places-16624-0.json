   "body": "<p> <span class=\"popular\">Jangru Ding</span><span class=\"scholar\">Byang ru sdings</span> is situated on a fairly level low-lying ridge top that is bounded on the east by the <span class=\"popular\">Drongkar Chu</span><span class=\"scholar\">Grong dkar chu</span>. On the west side it is flanked by a ravine. Due to the presence of many rocky mounds and depressions the surface of the site is undulating. Stones of erstwhile structures are scattered everywhere but there are no coherent walls left. The archaeological dispersion (170 m x 55 m) covers the entire ridge-top and appears to represent what was once a large settlement. During recent informal excavations human bones and ceramic shards have been recovered from the site. Shallow excavations have taken place all over <span class=\"popular\">Jangru Ding</span><span class=\"scholar\">Byang ru sdings</span> to collect stones for local construction projects. Township officials report that both square and round stone feet used to support pillars were also discovered at the site (none were available for inspection because they have been used in the construction of walls in local homes). In an excavation (1.8 m in depth) that had been carried out on the east side of <span class=\"popular\">Jangru Ding</span><span class=\"scholar\">Byang ru sdings</span>, a human rib bone and fire-blackened unglazed redware were clear to see. This evidence does indeed indicate that <span class=\"popular\">Jangru Ding</span><span class=\"scholar\">Byang ru sdings</span> was a locus of permanent habitation.</p>",
