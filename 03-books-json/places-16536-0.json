This conical hill has commanding views south over the <span class=\"popular\">Purang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Spu rang</span> valley. Occupying an extremely strategic location, the old stronghold straddled the route between the pastoral highlands of <span class=\"popular\">Purang Tö</span><span class=\"scholar\">Spu rang stod</span> and the agricultural valleys of <span class=\"popular\">Purang Mé</span><span class=\"scholar\">Spu rang smad</span>. Important lines of trade and communication are likely to have been controlled from this point. Earthen wall remnants on the north side of the summit are identified as belonging to a <span class=\"popular emph\">ten chidar</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">bstan phyi dar</span> era monastery. Dissolving foundations and revetments to the south of this ruined monastery are reported to be the races of <span class=\"popular\">Kardung Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dkar dung mkhar</span>. This facility appears to have consisted primarily of earthen structures. There are also highly obscured cobble wall fragments.

Below the summit on a wide shelf are thickly arrayed cobble foundations of what is supposed to have been the original village of <span class=\"popular\">Kardung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dkar dung</span>. Ancient habitations in Upper Tibet were customarily situated above the valley bottoms on high ground. On the flanks of the <span class=\"popular\">Kardung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dkar dung</span> hill are shrines to the local protective deities, <span class=\"popular\">Makzor Gyelpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dmag zor rgyal mo</span> and <span class=\"popular\">Medo Lhatsen</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mes do lha btsan</span> (the <span class=\"popular\">yüllha</span><span class=\"scholar\">Yul lha</span> of <span class=\"popular\">Langa Tso</span><span class=\"scholar\">La lnga mtsho</span>). </p> "},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":" <p>According to elders of <span class=\"popular\">Kardung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dkar dung</span> village (including its religious head, <span class=\"popular\">Ngödrup Dorje</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dngos grub rdo rje</span>), the first fortress of <span class=\"popular\">Kardung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dkar dung</span>, <span class=\"popular\">Kardung Khyungdzong Karmo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dkar dung khyung rdzong dkar mo</span>, was founded no less than 900 years ago. At around that time a Buddhist monastery known as <span class=\"popular\">Mangdzhuk Gönpa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mang bzhug dgon pa</span> was also established on the north side of the summit.<a href=\"#n51\" name=\"nb51\" class=\"note\">51</a> It was eventually destroyed by the <span class=\"popular\">Singpa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sing pa</span> (probably the Ladakhi).

It is said that around 100 residences were once located here.

It was destroyed in the Chinese Cultural Revolution.

Local sources also state that the <span class=\"popular\">Kardung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dkar dung</span> hill was once encircled by a defensive wall punctuated by four gateways. <span class=\"popular\">Tsering Chömpel</span><span class=\"scholar\">Tshe ring chos ’phel</span>, a cultural luminary residing in India, opines (in personal communication) that the fortress of <span class=\"popular\">Kardung Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dkar dung mkhar</span> may date to pre-Buddhist times (the prominent geographic position of the site encourages such speculation). </p> <hr class=\"footnote-divider\" /> "},{"title":"Notes","index":6,"parent_index":0,"body":" <div class=\"footnote\"> <a name=\"n51\" /> <a href=\"#nb51\" class=\"note\"> [51] </a> According to the historical text <span class=\"popular emph\">Khorchak Gönpé Logyü Depter Ngül Kuché Sum Gi Ngönjung Tam</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">’Khor chags dgon pa’i lo rgyus deb gter dngul sku mched gsum gyi sngon byung gtam</span>, in the tenth century CE, the king of <span class=\"popular\">Purang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Spu rang</span> under the behest of the great <span class=\"popular\">Kardung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dkar dung</span> master <span class=\"popular\">Chöjé Dzamling Drakpa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Chos rje ’dzam gling grags pa</span> founded the monastery of <span class=\"popular\">Serkhar Drakpé Tsuklak Khang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gser mkhar grags pa’i gtsug lag khang</span>, as well as a lower and upper castle at <span class=\"popular\">Kardung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dkar dung</span> (<span class=\"popular\">Guge Tsering Gyelpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ge tshe ring rgyal po</span>, <span class=\"popular emph\">nga ri chö jung</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">Mnga’ ris chos ’byung</span>, 115). </div>  "}]}
