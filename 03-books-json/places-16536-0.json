This conical hill has commanding views south over the <span class=\"popular\">Purang<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Spu rang<\/span> valley. Occupying an extremely strategic location, the old stronghold straddled the route between the pastoral highlands of <span class=\"popular\">Purang T\u00f6<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Spu rang stod<\/span> and the agricultural valleys of <span class=\"popular\">Purang M\u00e9<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Spu rang smad<\/span>. Important lines of trade and communication are likely to have been controlled from this point. Earthen wall remnants on the north side of the summit are identified as belonging to a <span class=\"popular emph\">ten chidar<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">bstan phyi dar<\/span> era monastery. Dissolving foundations and revetments to the south of this ruined monastery are reported to be the races of <span class=\"popular\">Kardung Khar<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Dkar dung mkhar<\/span>.

Below the summit on a wide shelf are thickly arrayed cobble foundations of what is supposed to have been the original village of <span class=\"popular\">Kardung<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Dkar dung<\/span>.

At around that time a Buddhist monastery known as <span class=\"popular\">Mangdzhuk G\u00f6npa<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Mang bzhug dgon pa<\/span> was also established on the north side of the summit.<a href=\"#n51\" name=\"nb51\" class=\"note\">51<\/a> It was eventually destroyed by the <span class=\"popular\">Singpa<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Sing pa<\/span> (probably the Ladakhi).
