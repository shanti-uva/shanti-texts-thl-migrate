The four uneven sides of <span class=\"popular\">Dralung Doring<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Gra lung rdo ring<\/span> are roughly oriented in the cardinal directions.

Perhaps the pillar was once enclosed by walls but, if so, there are virtually no traces left. Near gra lung rdo ring, a few stones are embedded in the ground, however, no order can be discerned in their placement. Another single, tall and slim pillar in the region was indeed erected inside an enclosure (see C-123).<\/p> <p>In the vicinity of gra lung mon dur there is a small and a larger wall with old inscribed plaques.
