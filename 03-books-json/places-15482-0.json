   "body": "<p>The <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15482\">Drigung</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"F15482\">'bri gung</span></em>) institution, formed through the efforts of the <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kyura</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">skyu ra</span></em>) family in the late twelfth century, was a major ecclesiastic, political, and military power in central Tibet during the late thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries. If <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15482\">Drigung</span> exemplifies the integration of religious and secular power in Tibet during the renaissance of Tibetan Buddhism in the twelfth century, <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15482\">Drigung</span> also exemplifies the limited state of our knowledge regarding early Tibetan polities, for while we know much about the religious affairs of <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15482\">Drigung</span> Monastery, we possess few sources with which to understand the political history of the institution despite its great importance.</p><p><span class=\"place\" title=\"F15482\">Drigung</span> Monastery was established by the prominent figure in the <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kyura</span> family, <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Jikten Gönpo</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">'jig rten mgon po</span></em>, 1143-1127) in 1179. <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Jikten Gönpo</span> was by all accounts a gifted teacher, and by the end of his life had amassed hundreds of disciples around him. His movement eventually became known as one of the subsects of the <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kagyü</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">bka' brgyud</span></em>) tradition, named <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Drigung Kagyü</span><span style=\"font-size: 9.83796px;\"> </span>(<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">'bri gung bka' brgyud</span></em>) after his home monastery. This monastery went on to have a vital religious life down to the present day, and its abbots, beginning with <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Jikten Gönpo</span> himself, were among the most important Buddhist leaders and scholars throughout central Tibetan history. And while the <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Drigung</span> sect of the <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kagyü</span> tradition was lead in religious affairs by the <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15482\">Drigung</span> Abbot, the sect also had a civil leader, known as the <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15482\">Drigung</span> <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Gompa</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">sgom pa</span></em>). The first <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15482\">Drigung</span> <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Gompa</span>, <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dorjé Senggé</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">rdo rje seng ge</span></em>) was born between 1199 and 1210, and appointed sometime in the early to mid thirteenth century, though the exact date is uncertain. It is clear that he was, like <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Jikten Gönpo</span> himself, a member of the prominent family of the <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15482\">Drigung</span> region, the <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kyura</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">skyu ra</span></em>). The office of <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Gompa</span> came into prominence on the political stage during the tenure of its second holder, <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Shakya Rinchen</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">shākya rin chen</span></em>). According to <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15482\">Drigung</span> sources, <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Shakya Rinchen</span> was captured by Mongol forces lead by <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dorta</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">dor rta</span></em>) in 1240, but was later released. This suggests that the <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15482\">Drigung</span> <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Gompa</span> was the military leader of <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15482\">Drigung</span> during the mid thirteenth century, and that the office was of considerable importance in the secular affairs of <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15482\">Drigung</span> by that time. It also suggests that <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15482\">Drigung</span> was an institution of formidable regional power. In 1331 <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15482\">Drigung</span> was significant enough to receive official correspondence, along with the <span class=\"place\" title=\"F11608\">Pakmodru</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"F11608\">phag mo gru</span></em>) and <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Tsepa</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">tsel pa</span></em>) polities, from the Yuan Department for Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs. <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15482\">Drigung</span>'s stature is born out further by the Mongol census of Tibetan territories undertaken in 1368, which counted the <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15482\">Drigung</span> territory as one of the thirteen myriarchies or <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">trikor</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">khri skor</span></em>) under the control of Sakya-Yuan authority, and estimated that it contained 3630 agricultural and pastoral households.</p><p><span class=\"place\" title=\"F15482\">Drigung</span>'s fortunes appear to have risen until, in 1290, they came into armed conflict with the Sakya, rulers of central Tibet under the Yuan empire. <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15482\">Drigung</span> had made aggressive moves against <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15481\">Sakya</span> establishments prior to this, as when in 1285 they destroyed <span class=\"place\" title=\"F11611\">Jayül</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"F11611\">bya yul</span></em>) Monastery, killing the abbot in the process. However, it was their monastery that was destroyed in 1290 by a combination of Mongolian and Tibetan troops led by the <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Sakya Pönchen</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">dpon chen</span></em>) <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Aklen</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">a glen</span></em>). It was burned to the ground, and the secular authority of the institution was severely curtailed. The \"<span class=\"place\" title=\"F15482\">Drigung</span> Revolt\" of 1290 was devastating to the establishment, and neither the abbot or the <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Gompa</span> appear to have played any major role in Tibetan politics for quite some time after this. By the mid-fourteenth century they had recovered sufficiently to take military action against the rising power of the day, the <span class=\"place\" title=\"F11608\">Pakmodru</span>. This conflict between the two powers in 1350 dealt the decisive blow to <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15482\">Drigung</span> as its army failed against the <span class=\"place\" title=\"F11608\">Pakmodru</span>. <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15482\">Drigung</span> was never again to be a major political player in central Tibet. However, this did not totally eradicate <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15482\">Drigung</span> as a regional political force, for during the conflict the junior <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Gompa</span> <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Shakya Zangpo</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">shākya bzang po</span></em>) attempted to assert <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15482\">Drigung</span>'s dominance even after major military defeats, and he  was prominent enough through these attempts to be given the title of Tai Situ (ta'i sit u) by the Yuan court. This title was given to <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15482\">Drigung</span> rulers even in to the Ming period. Writing from a distance of several centuries the Fifth Dalai Lama tells us in his 1642 history of central Tibetan politics that <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15482\">Drigung</span> was, along with <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Tsé</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">tsel</span></em>), among the most powerful of the myriarchies under Sakya-Yuan rule. Its territories were incorporated into lands controlled by the King of <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15354\">Tsang</span> (<span class=\"place\" title=\"F15354\"><em>gtsang</em></span>) in the late sixteenth century, and thence into the <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15466\">Ganden</span> Government's realm in 1642.</p>",
