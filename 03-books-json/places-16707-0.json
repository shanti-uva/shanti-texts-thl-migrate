The site is situated on he left side of the valley above the marshy bottomland. The views are fairly open in all but the eastern direction, which is constricted by the ridge on the opposite side of the <span class=\"popular\">Tratsang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Khra tshang</span> valley. The terrain is well drained, sandy and gravelly. In addition to two pillars there is still at least one funerary enclosure at the site. </p>",

This double-course wall segment is composed of stones 20 cm o 25 cm in length, which are flush with the ground surface. East of the pillars there are two east-west oriented wall fragments, the most southerly of which may have been part of the enclosure’s south wall. A 5-m length of this wall is in situ and it is of the same construction as the west wall. The other east-west wall fragment is located 50 cm north of the south wall fragment. This seems to be an uncharacteristic placement for a wall in this monument typology. This inner east-west wall fragment (2.4 m long, 40 cm wide) is composed of upright stones, 15 cm to 25 cm in length. </p>",

These pillars are made of a white rock that has urned red in certain places. The area in front of the pillars moderately slopes down to the east, in the direction of the valley bottom.

A small <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma ṇi </span>wall is found 14 m north of this funerary enclosure.
