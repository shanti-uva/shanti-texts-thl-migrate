However, the integrity of the site is significantly hreatened by local <span class=\"popular emph\">drok pa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">’brog pa</span>, who are removing stones from the structures in order to build pastoral facilities. A couple of corrals (<span class=\"popular emph\">lhara</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">lhas ra</span>) belonging to a seasonal encampment are found at <span class=\"popular\">Burkar Zhung</span><span class=\"scholar\">’Bur dkar gzhung</span>. The double-course perimeter walls of the larger enclosures contain variable-length blocky stones (primarily 20 cm to 60 cm long), which are flush with the ground surface or rise above it to a height of 50 cm. Some of these walls appear to have been more than one vertical course in height. The larger enclosures are free of superficial structural elements within the perimeter walls. </p>",
