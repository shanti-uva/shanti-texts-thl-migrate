This white rock pillar is firmly planted in the middle of a level stretch of gravel-strewn ground. It has four uneven sides and measures 1.6 m in height and has a basal girth of 1.4 m. Some small stones are scattered around the base of the worn and discolored pillar. On the standing stone there are traces of orange climax lichen. To the north of the pillar there is a line of four large stones (up to 1.5 m long) embedded in the ground, which project upwards of 30 cm above the surface. The architectural relationship between these four stones and the pillar is not clear. </p> "},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":" <p>According to local sources, <span class=\"popular\">Chönkhor Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Chos ’khor rdo ring</span> is an old border marker of the <span class=\"popular\">Döyö</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sdod yod</span> region.</p>  "}]}
