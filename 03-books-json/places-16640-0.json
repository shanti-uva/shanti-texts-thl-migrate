   "body": "<p>The east side of <span class=\"popular\">Domuk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Do smug</span>, an island of the same size and aspect as <span class=\"popular\">Doser</span><span class=\"scholar\">Do ser</span> (B-132), also gave rise o an ancient settlement. Called <span class=\"popular\">Domuk Tsamkhang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Do smug mtshams khang</span>, the ruins of a rebuilt all-stone corbelled edifice is located in a small east-west running vale that overlooks <span class=\"popular\">Langa Tso</span><span class=\"scholar\">La lnga mtsho</span>. In a nearby vale there is the carcass of an unmodified <span class=\"popular emph\">do khang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rdo khang</span>. Walls of these structures are of typical random-rubble construction, and are composed of metamorphic rocks and unhewn blocks of a white concretion of variable length (up to 60 cm long). </p><p>The dereliction of the <span class=\"popular\">Domuk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Do smug</span> and <span class=\"popular\">Doser</span><span class=\"scholar\">Do ser</span> sites underscores their highly marginal place in Buddhist sacred geographical conceptions. Their importance to archaic cultural settlement, however, is reinforced by the fact that they are the only early residential centers detected in the <span class=\"popular\">Langa Tso</span><span class=\"scholar\">La lnga mtsho</span> basin. Like the other islands of Upper Tibet, <span class=\"popular\">Domuk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Do smug</span> and <span class=\"popular\">Doser</span><span class=\"scholar\">Do ser</span> were nuclei of ritual dispensation and religious authority. They are also likely to have been important social and political hubs inhabited by a privileged class of people. This is borne out by the highly developed nature of the architecture and patterns of habitation, which demanded considerable mainland economic resources to establish and maintain. These sheltered communities sprang up on every island of noteworthy size in the region (see fn. 167). The 15 island settlements of Upper Tibet formed a sacred east-west axis stretching from <span class=\"popular\">Namtso</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gnam mtsho</span> in the east to <span class=\"popular\">Langa Tso</span><span class=\"scholar\">La lnga mtsho</span> and mtsho mo ngang la ring mo in the west. Straddling the central portion of the entire upland region, these islands constituted the geographic core of archaic settlement in Upper Tibet. It is not known if these centers were exclusively the domain of religious practitioners or whether they accommodated a wider cross-section of ancient society. The larger sites in particular are likely to have catered to integrated family units and not just to individuals. Smaller insular sites such as <span class=\"popular\">Podo Gongma</span><span class=\"scholar\">Spos do gong ma</span> (B-11) may have had a more isolated sphere of usage. </p>",

   "body": "<p>According to local accounts, one or more Buddhist masters meditated in <span class=\"popular\">Domuk Tsamkhang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Do smug mtshams khang</span>. Elders of the <span class=\"popular emph\">draktsa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">brag rtsa</span> clan (who have grazing rights on the islands of <span class=\"popular\">Langa Tso</span><span class=\"scholar\">La lnga mtsho</span>) recount that a lama named <span class=\"popular\">Balé</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ba le</span> (sp.?) once resided in the <span class=\"popular\">Domuk Tsamkhang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Do smug mtshams khang</span>. During a <span class=\"popular\">Singpa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sing pa</span> invasion originating from Central Asia (the historical setting and ethnic group involved is ambiguous), lama <span class=\"popular\">Balé</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ba le</span> collected the valuables of people living in <span class=\"popular\">Purang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Spu rang</span> and buried them on <span class=\"popular\">Domuk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Do smug</span>, in order to save them from the invaders. Three or four years later with the death of lama <span class=\"popular\">Balé</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ba le</span>, the people of <span class=\"popular\">Purang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Spu rang</span> came to collect their possessions. The people quarreled among themselves about who owned what. Lama <span class=\"popular\">Balé</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ba le</span>, who was sitting in meditation in the intermediate state (<span class=\"popular emph\">bardo</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">bar do</span>) at the time, was adversely affected by the disturbances around him and, as a result, took rebirth as a demon (<span class=\"popular\">dré</span><span class=\"scholar\">’Dre</span>). This <span class=\"popular\">dré</span><span class=\"scholar\">’Dre</span> <span class=\"emph\"> </span>caused many deaths in <span class=\"popular\">Purang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Spu rang</span> until it was tied to a Buddhist oath by a lama of <span class=\"popular\">Purang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Spu rang</span> named <span class=\"popular\">Chimé</span><span class=\"scholar\">’Chi med</span>. This tale seems to indicate that Buddhist tenure at <span class=\"popular\">Domuk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Do smug</span> was tenuous and highly limited.

It consists of four small square structures of typical archaic construction, which appear to have been oriented in the cardinal directions. They were constructed from bluish metamorphic rocks of variable length (up o 70 cm long) laid in random-rubble courses. Like many archaic shrines on the islands of Tibet, this complex has a lakeside orientation, suggesting that it may have been used in the propitiation of<span class=\"popular\">Dralé Gyelmo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sgra bla’i rgyal mo</span>, the goddess of <span class=\"popular\">Langa Tso</span><span class=\"scholar\">La lnga mtsho</span>.

The southeast specimen (1.7 m 1.6 m x 1.1 m) appears to have been reconstructed at some point in time. The top 50 cm of the structure is composed of a heap of white concretion blocks. The northeast specimen (1.4 m x 1.6 m x 80 cm) is situated 1 m north of the southeast specimen. A few white concretion blocks were placed on top of this heavily damaged structure. Resting against its east side there is a rounded piece of sandstone (60 cm long) with a depression on one side. It has he classic appearance of a <span class=\"popular emph\">zhap jé</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">zhabs rje</span> (footprint of saint), but nothing appears to be known about its identity and it bears no signs of recent veneration. The central shrine (1.7 m x 1.6 m x 40 cm) is situated 80 cm west of the northeast specimen. Only its base still stands. The west shrine (1.7 m x 1.3 m x 40 cm) is located 3.7 m west of the southeast specimen. This structure is also highly dissolute, revealing little about its original design and function.</p>",

   "body": "<p> <span class=\"popular\">Domuk Tsamkhang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Do smug mtshams khang</span> (residential structure RS1) is situated on the edge of a tiny valley facing <span class=\"popular\">Langa Tso</span><span class=\"scholar\">La lnga mtsho</span> (38.21΄ / 10.32΄ / 4610 m). It has a southern aspect and measures 6.6 m (east-west) x 5.6 m (north-south). RS1 exhibits signs of reconstruction and more recent occupation. For instance, the two rear rooms of the structure are partly intact, probably because they were maintained by Buddhist meditators. The rear outer wall currently has an exterior height of 1.3 m and an interior height of 1 m. The roof of the rear west room (2 m x 2.1 m) is partly in place. The roof sheathing is composed of a bluish calcareous rock that forms neat slabs (up to 1.2 m long). There are several small niches in he rear wall and the vestiges of mud plaster. The forward wall and the wall separating the rear west room from its eastern counterpart are also partly intact. These walls are of typical random-rubble construction and are primarily composed of <span class=\"popular\">Domuk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Do smug</span>’s bluish metamorphic rock. The rear east room (2.1 m x 1.8 m) has niches in its rear and west walls. The forward tier of RS1 has been mostly destroyed. Measuring 6.4 m (east-west) x 2.9 m (north-south), it appears to have been comprised of a combination of rooms and open areas. Although there are small coherent wall fragments (up to 1 m high), the forward outer wall of RS1 has been largely reduced to rubble. In what is left of the east wall there are a few well-worn adobe blocks, signaling that the structure was rehabilitated for a more recent occupation. </p><p>The traces of a more recently constructed building are situated in the valley bottom 4.5 m east of RS1. It almost certainly belonged to the Buddhists. This carcass has an L-shaped plan and maximum dimensions of 4.5 m (east-west) x 5.5 m (north-south). Except for north and east wall segments, the structure has been leveled to its foundations. The walls are lightly built and only around 35 cm thick. The north wall segment has courses of adobe blocks above the stonework. These crude and insubstantial random-rubble walls are ypical of later historic Lamaist architecture in southwestern Tibet. </p><p>Immediately south of RS1 there are fragmentary wall footings that cover an area measuring 5.8 m x 4.6 m. These footings are probably the remains of a courtyard or some other type of enclosure. </p>",

   "body": "<p>Residential structure RS2 is found in a small vale sheltering it from the brunt of the elements (38.08΄ / 10.52΄ / 4620 m). It was built near the base of a south-facing slope just below a rock outcrop. It measures 9.5 m (east-west) x 10.3 m (north-south). The amount of rubble at the site indicates that this was a heavily-built structure. Just southeast of this edifice there is a shepherd’s enclosure (<span class=\"popular emph\">droklhé</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">’brog lhas</span>) (4 m x 4.5 m) built with stones commandeered from the archaeological asset. RS2 was built in three distinct elevations: south/forward, central and north/rear. In each of these three tiers here appears to have been two or three rooms. The east side of the structure is not so clearly demarcated and may have contained a courtyard or landing as well as rooms. The forward wall of RS2, now nothing more than a heap of stones, is elevated about 1 m above the slope. Most of the rest of the structure has also been reduced o piles of stones. </p><p>The rear of the RS2 edifice is the only place that the ground plan can be distinguished. There is a rear west room and a rear central room. The configuration of the east side of the rear tier is no longer discernable. The rear west room (2.6 m x 2 m) is divided by a partition wall (1.2 m long, 80 cm high, 45 cm thick) into north and south sections. The north section of this room is elevated about 50 cm above the south section. The north section had a low ceiling and may have had a ritual rather than habitational function. The rear/north wall of rear central room (2.3 m x 1.8 m) was built at least 1.1 m into the uphill slope. This wall originally was more deeply inset but some infilling of the rear central room has occurred. In the rear wall there are two large niches separated from one another by a single slab of stone. Mud plaster sticks to the back wall of the rear central room. One piece of the roof sheathing (80 cm x 90 cm) is still attached to the back wall of the rear central room. Parts of the west wall (up to 1.2 m high) and east wall (up to 50 cm high) of the rear central room are intact. Above the top of the rear wall, which is now flush with the slope, there are the remnants of a parapet wall, 50 cm in height. Roof appurtenances (up to 1.3 m long) are scattered around the RS2 carcass.</p>",
