Their importance to archaic cultural settlement,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thowever, is reinforced by the fact that they are the only early residential centers detected in the <span class=\"popular\">Langa Tso</span><span class=\"scholar\">La lnga mtsho</span> basin. Like the other islands of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUpper Tibet, <span class=\"popular\">Domuk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Do smug</span> and <span class=\"popular\">Doser</span><span class=\"scholar\">Do ser</span> were nuclei of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tritual dispensation and religious authority. They are also likely to have been important social and political hubs\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinhabited by a privileged class of people. This is borne out by the highly developed nature of the architecture\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand patterns of habitation, which demanded considerable mainland economic resources to establish and maintain.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThese sheltered communities sprang up on every island of noteworthy size in the region (see fn. 167). The 15\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tisland settlements of Upper Tibet formed a sacred east-west axis stretching from\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"popular\">Namtso</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gnam mtsho</span> in the east to <span class=\"popular\">Langa Tso</span><span class=\"scholar\">La lnga mtsho</span> and mtsho mo ngang la ring\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmo in the west. Straddling the central portion of the entire upland region, these islands\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconstituted the geographic core of archaic settlement in Upper Tibet. It is not\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tknown if these centers were exclusively the domain of religious practitioners or whether they accommodated a wider\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcross-section of ancient society. The larger sites in particular are likely to have catered to integrated family\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tunits and not just to individuals.

The north section of this room is elevated about 50 cm above the south section. The north\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsection had a low ceiling and may have had a ritual rather than habitational function. The rear/north wall of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trear central room (2.3 m x 1.8 m) was built at least 1.1 m into the uphill slope.

In the rear wall there are two large\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tniches separated from one another by a single slab of stone. Mud plaster sticks to the back wall of the rear\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcentral room.
