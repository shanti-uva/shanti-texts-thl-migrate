Called <span class=\"popular\">Domuk Tsamkhang<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Do smug mtshams khang<\/span>, the ruins of a rebuilt all-stone corbelled edifice is located in a small east-west running vale that overlooks <span class=\"popular\">Langa Tso<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">La lnga mtsho<\/span>.

Their importance to archaic cultural settlement, however, is reinforced by the fact that they are the only early residential centers detected in the <span class=\"popular\">Langa Tso<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">La lnga mtsho<\/span> basin. Like the other islands of Upper Tibet, <span class=\"popular\">Domuk<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Do smug<\/span> and <span class=\"popular\">Doser<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Do ser<\/span> were nuclei of ritual dispensation and religious authority. They are also likely to have been important social and political hubs inhabited by a privileged class of people. This is borne out by the highly developed nature of the architecture and patterns of habitation, which demanded considerable mainland economic resources to establish and maintain. These sheltered communities sprang up on every island of noteworthy size in the region (see fn. 167). The 15 island settlements of Upper Tibet formed a sacred east-west axis stretching from <span class=\"popular\">Namtso<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Gnam mtsho<\/span> in the east to <span class=\"popular\">Langa Tso<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">La lnga mtsho<\/span> and mtsho mo ngang la ring mo in the west. Straddling the central portion of the entire upland region, these islands constituted the geographic core of archaic settlement in Upper Tibet. It is not known if these centers were exclusively the domain of religious practitioners or whether they accommodated a wider cross-section of ancient society. The larger sites in particular are likely to have catered to integrated family units and not just to individuals. Smaller insular sites such as <span class=\"popular\">Podo Gongma<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Spos do gong ma<\/span> (B-11) may have had a more isolated sphere of usage. <\/p> "},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":null},{"title":"Site elements","index":6,"parent_index":2,"body":" "},{"title":"Shrine complex","index":7,"parent_index":6,"body":null},{"title":"Do smug mtshams khang","index":8,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p> <span class=\"popular\">Domuk Tsamkhang<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Do smug mtshams khang<\/span> (residential structure RS1) is situated on the edge of a tiny valley facing <span class=\"popular\">Langa Tso<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">La lnga mtsho<\/span> (38.21&#900; \/ 10.32&#900; \/ 4610 m). It has a southern aspect and measures 6.6 m (east-west) x 5.6 m (north-south). RS1 exhibits signs of reconstruction and more recent occupation. For instance, the two rear rooms of the structure are partly intact, probably because they were maintained by Buddhist meditators. The rear outer wall currently has an exterior height of 1.3 m and an interior height of 1 m. The roof of the rear west room (2 m x 2.1 m) is partly in place. The roof sheathing is composed of a bluish calcareous rock that forms neat slabs (up to 1.2 m long). There are several small niches in he rear wall and the vestiges of mud plaster. The forward wall and the wall separating the rear west room from its eastern counterpart are also partly intact. These walls are of typical random-rubble construction and are primarily composed of <span class=\"popular\">Domuk<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Do smug<\/span>&rsquo;s bluish metamorphic rock. The rear east room (2.1 m x 1.8 m) has niches in its rear and west walls. The forward tier of RS1 has been mostly destroyed. Measuring 6.4 m (east-west) x 2.9 m (north-south), it appears to have been comprised of a combination of rooms and open areas. Although there are small coherent wall fragments (up to 1 m high), the forward outer wall of RS1 has been largely reduced to rubble. In what is left of the east wall there are a few well-worn adobe blocks, signaling that the structure was rehabilitated for a more recent occupation. <\/p> <p>The traces of a more recently constructed building are situated in the valley bottom 4.5 m east of RS1. It almost certainly belonged to the Buddhists. This carcass has an L-shaped plan and maximum dimensions of 4.5 m (east-west) x 5.5 m (north-south). Except for north and east wall segments, the structure has been leveled to its foundations. The walls are lightly built and only around 35 cm thick. The north wall segment has courses of adobe blocks above the stonework. These crude and insubstantial random-rubble walls are ypical of later historic Lamaist architecture in southwestern Tibet. <\/p> <p>Immediately south of RS1 there are fragmentary wall footings that cover an area measuring 5.8 m x 4.6 m. These footings are probably the remains of a courtyard or some other type of enclosure. <\/p> "},{"title":"Residential Structure RS2","index":9,"parent_index":6,"body":null}]}
