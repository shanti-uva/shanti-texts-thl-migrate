The interior walls are mud plastered while the ceiling is not. Like most other inhabitable caves in the gu ge region, P1 has various niches and recesses in the walls. The most notable example is found in the northeast wall. This 1.2-m wide, 70-cm deep bay starts 35 cm from the floor and extends to the ceiling. This recess was well finished with plaster and has a base of four graduated tiers.<\/p> "},{"title":"Cave P2","index":19,"parent_index":13,"body":" <p>(3.3 m x 3 m x 1.8 m)<\/p> <p>Located immediately south of P1, this cave also has a west-facing arched entrance. In the east wall of the cave there is a recess with the remains of a wooden lintel. Just above it light-colored coarse hand-woven woolen fabric is embedded in the wall. This fabric appears to be part of the original construction of the cave, serving as a kind of lining. <\/p> "},{"title":"Cave P3","index":20,"parent_index":13,"body":null},{"title":"Cave P4","index":21,"parent_index":13,"body":" <p>(5.3 m x 1.4 m)<\/p> <p>This was a forward cave flanking the fronts of P1 and P2.

These caves face in he south, east and west directions. Only two of the caves (west-facing) in this sector exhibit freestanding anterooms. One south-facing cave has two chambers with three hearths. In the rear of this cave there is an altar or storage area that was plastered and painted red and yellow. In the upper-most group of 10 caves known as <span class=\"popular\">Metok Ling<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Me tog gling<\/span> (Flower Garden), I discovered a scrap of an entertainment page from the Daily Mail of 1930s or 1940s vintage. It must have been brought here by traders and by implication they may have found shelter in this cave. Two of the caves in this group have walls that were painted in red ochre, one of which also has white blotches applied to it. <\/p> <hr class=\"footnote-divider\" \/> "},{"title":"Notes","index":27,"parent_index":0,"body":" <div class=\"footnote\"> <a name=\"n77\" \/> <a href=\"#nb77\" class=\"note\"> [77] <\/a> Bellezza, <em>Antiquities of Upper Tibet<\/em>. <\/div>  "}]}
