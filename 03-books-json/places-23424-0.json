In 1697 or so, mKhas btsun bSam gtan nyi ma established the site as a place for meditation practice. There he meditated upon the tutelary deity dBal phur nag po and finally attained realization.<\/p><p>The monastery is regarded as the sacred site of Phur pa. It is said that there are clear traces of a tiger, a snow lion, a Garuda and a dragon having landed on the cardinal points of this monastery. To the north is the mountain sBas yul gtsang ma dga\u2019 ba\u2019i ri. The fact that the mountain is said to have a hidden place (<span xmlns:str=\"http:\/\/exslt.org\/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">sbas yul<\/span>) where Tshe dbang rig \u2019dzin attained realization explains why it is called dGa\u2019 ri (the Mountain of Joy).<\/p><p>bsTan pa\u2019i nyi ma, who was a disciple of the great saint bsTan \u2019dzin rin chen bde chen snying po, practised meditation in this place and attained realization. He built a temple and collected religious objects, so that the hermitage was finally transformed into a monastery.

He looked after the interests of dGa\u2019 ri Monastery. He took an oath to be a monk in the presence of Phun tshogs blo gros, the great abbot of sMan ri (No.1), and rendered great services during his whole life.<\/p><p>The main religious objects of this monastery are a reliquary stupa of mKhas btsun bSam gtan nyi ma, a gilt-bronze statue of rNam par rgyal ba as high as the ceiling, a statue of rGyal ba mNyam med pa made of a mixture of medicine and clay, and statues of rGyal yum Byams ma and Dran pa nam mkha\u2019 with his twin sons. There is also a great collection of scriptures written in gold and silver.<\/p><p>The principal deity of this monastery is dBal phur nag po, but offerings are constantly made to Khro bo, dBal gsas and sTag la, as well as the performance of the ceremony of \u201cthousand offerings\u201d to rNam rgyal.<\/p><p> In 1940, bsTan pa\u2019i nyi ma, the reincarnated lama of Srid rgyal dgon chen (No.88) of Bon ri in Kong po, after paying a visit to his native land, stayed at dGa\u2019 ri Monastery in solitary meditation.
