From the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">rdzong</span> to Rab pa is a distance of only sixty kilometres, but as there is no road, the going is very hard.</p><p>Although there is no recorded date for the establishment of this monastery, it is said to be one of the oldest Bonpo monasteries.</p><p>Before 1959, there were no more than eight monks, but at present there are fourteen. The name of this monastery is said to be related to the fact that the area where the monastery is located is so large that it would take a day on horseback to circumambulate it. The place is therefore the best among the local areas and that is why it is called Rab pa, the “Best”.</p><p>In the temple of the monastery are several statues of sTon pa gShen rab, Dran pa nam mkha’ and Byams ma, a few thangka and Bonpo scriptures. Otherwise the facilities are very poor.</p><p>As for the monks’ main source of income, they depend, just as in the other small Bonpo monasteries, on their own parents and relatives for support. Besides this, to make their living, they must supplement this support by going out to perform religious services.</p>",
