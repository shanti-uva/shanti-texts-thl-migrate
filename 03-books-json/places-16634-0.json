Much of the upper tier of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"popular\">Dzongmar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdzong dmar</span> was built under a large\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\toverhang in the escarpment. It consists of a Lamaist or Phase II fa&ccedil;ade that was lightly constructed and covered\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin a red ochre-tinted mud veneer. Most of this structure has been leveled so little can be said about its ground\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tplan. In front of the Phase II cliff shelter there are the even more dissolute traces of Phase I structures.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThese older structures were built at two distinctive elevations and subdivided into four main sections. Only\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsmall vestiges of the well-designed and robustly-built walls are extant. These wall fragments are up to 2 m in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\theight. The middle tier (18 m x 4.3 m) ruins are divided into two main parts. The lower tier (6 m x 5.2 m) is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsituated 2 m below the middle tier, and appears to have consisted of just one building. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Ten meters away from <span class=\"popular\">Dzongmar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdzong dmar</span> in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdirection of <span class=\"popular\">Namtso</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gnam mtsho</span> there is an isolated\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPhase I foundation (7.7 m x 4 m). Eight meters east of <span class=\"popular\">Dzongmar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdzong dmar</span> there is a Phase II fa&ccedil;ade at the base of the escarpment. This fa&ccedil;ade (around 2 m\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thigh) is covered in a mud veneer and encloses a space measuring 2.5 m x 2.3 m. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>There is also a shallow cave in the formation that has faint wall traces, another Phase I settlement locus\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(49.94&#900; / 22.75&#900;). The base of a square shrine sits on a bench in close proximity to this cave shelter (49.96&#900; /\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t22.76&#900;). This ceremonial structure (3.6 m x 3.6 m) is not aligned in the cardinal directions, and has been\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\treduced to 1 m or less in height. The base of a second tier is barely visible, but indicating just the same that\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthis was a tiered structure. At the base of the escarpment there is another cave, which has the remains of a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfa&ccedil;ade that appears to be of limited age (50.135&#900; / 22.88&#900;).

The monuments (mostly consisting of stone altars (<span class=\"popular emph\">lhato</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">lha tho</span>) and cairns (<span class=\"popular\">lats&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">La btsas</span>)) appear to be of composite construction, with the Buddhists\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thaving used older foundations for their own purposes.
