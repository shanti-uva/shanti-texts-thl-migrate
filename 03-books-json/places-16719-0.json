Although parts of all four walls are discernable, they are in a state of advanced disintegration. These walls are composed of variable-length (10 cm to 40 cm long) blocky pieces of gray limestone and a harder brown rock. The ground on the east end of the enclosure is uneven. On the west end of the enclosure there is a rise of about 1 m, which can probably be attributed to localized geomorphologic changes. The north side of the enclosure is partly overgrown with <span class=\"popular emph\">drama</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">gra ma</span> brush. </p> "},{"title":"Pillars","index":8,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p>Close to what was the west wall of the enclosure there is a white tabular pillar (1.2 m [height] x 1.2 m [basal girth]). The two broad sides of the standing stone are oriented north and south. This highly worn menhir (Long-stone DR1) is discolored in places. The pillar is not well centered in the enclosure; it was at least one of two main pillars near the west wall. The other main pillar is dislodged and lies just outside the enclosure. It is a well-formed four-sided white specimen (1.2 m long x 70 cm girth). Along the west wall, near the north side of the enclosure, there are also two small broken dark-colored pillars. They now stand 20 cm in height. Beside DR1 there is a broken inscribed <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma ṇi</span> plaque.</p> <p>A small wall fragment of what appears to be a vestige of a funerary enclosure is situated 2 m east of the pillar enclosure. </p>  "}]}
