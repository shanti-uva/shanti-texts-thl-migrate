This\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvalley has a number of springs. The well-drained gravel-covered ground of the putative ancient settlement is found\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ton the north margin of the valley at the foot of a rocky hill. The location has been heavily impacted by the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconstruction of pastoral camps in the pre-modern period, which still receive some usage in the wintertime. So\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthorough was the transformation of the site that virtually nothing of an earlier settlement can be detected on the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsurface.
