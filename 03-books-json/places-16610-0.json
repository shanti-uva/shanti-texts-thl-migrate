This valley has a number of springs. The well-drained gravel-covered ground of the putative ancient settlement is found on the north margin of the valley at the foot of a rocky hill. The location has been heavily impacted by the construction of pastoral camps in the pre-modern period, which still receive some usage in the wintertime. So thorough was the transformation of the site that virtually nothing of an earlier settlement can be detected on the surface.
