Although it is not very far, it takes more than an hour\n                        to get there by car because of the terribly muddy road, which makes the\n                        going difficult. This monastery is set in a fairly good natural\n                        environment.</p>\n\n                     <p>The monastery was founded in 1906. The predecessor of this monastery was\n                        sMad sog gYung drung &rsquo;dzin pa&rsquo;i gling (ruins of an ancient monastery near\n                        Nag chu kha were recently identified as those of this monastery) which was\n                        founded by Khyung po A bla grags pa and Sha ba sang grol. It was prosperous,\n                        with hundreds of monks and nuns. In spite of the extensive work devoted to\n                        the three noble deeds &ldquo;keeping, defending and spreading the teachings of\n                        Eternal Bon&rdquo; through generations of lamas, the monastery was upset by,\n                        needless to say, the troops of the Mongolian Jungar. During that time the\n                        Mongolians subjected the two Khyung po lamas, dBu se and dBu nag, to\n                        imprisonment and eventually murdered these two faultless lamas. The sight of\n                        this incident made their great many followers tremble and the lives of their\n                        followers subsequently fell into hopelessness.</p>\n\n                     <p>Then a monastery called Khri dkar was set up on the bank of the Yag chu\n                        river and the teachings of Bon were spread by several generations of lamas.\n                        Destiny, however, reduced the monastery to a deteriorated state. Khyung po\n                        bsTan rgyal grags pa then laid the foundation for the next one at Khyung\n                        rdzong, situated at Gad ngas la, and maintained it for a while, but it, too,\n                        collapsed in the Eleventh Rab byung.</p>\n\n                     <p>Then Mi &rsquo;gyur grags pa, rGyal skyid grags pa, Nyi dbang, lHa dbang, Tshe\n                        dbang g-yung drung and others, all from Khyung po, established the residence\n                           (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">bla brang</span>) of Khyung po sBra nag in A stod\n                        district, which burdened them with the expectations of many proponents of\n                        Eternal Bon that their thirst for a monastery would be satisfied.</p>\n\n                     <p>In 1882, a miraculous baby, who emitted many auspicious signs, was born to a\n                        couple, Khyung dkar gDung pa lha bu, the father, and Gur bza&rsquo; dPal &rsquo;dzoms,\n                        the mother. The baby was called Nam mkha&rsquo; rgyal mtshan. From childhood he\n                        stood out prominently among other children, with his varied talents. Endowed\n                        with auspicious signs, he was praised by everyone. Until the age of\n                        twenty-five, he lived as a herdsman in the manner of a yogi in order to\n                        avoid being possessed by unclean transmigratory existence. At that time, his\n                        parents repeatedly murmured their hope that their son would succeed to the\n                        leadership of the family, but he did not accept this, for he wanted to take\n                        an oath to become a monk.</p>\n\n                     <p>In 1906, Nam mkha&rsquo; rgyal mtshan was ordained in the presence of sMon rgyal\n                        Nam mkha&rsquo; dbang rgyal in rDza khog. In his mind, he conceived the idea of\n                        building a monastery at a certain rocky place surrounded by many\n                        outstandingly sacred sites such as the meditation cave of the great lama\n                        Dran pa nam mkha&rsquo;, his foot-prints and the like. Then a prophecy was made by\n                        the yogi A lo, and in accordance with it, in 1911 Nam mkha&rsquo; rgyal mtshan\n                        went to seek the place where a new monastery should be built.</p>\n\n                     <p>It was a place with many auspicious signs, such as the following: to the\n                        right, lHa ri spang mtho, whose summit consists of a crystal rock; at the\n                        front, Un chen dur krod nor bu spungs ri and gNyan chen wa ra, which look\n                        like dextral white conchs; and mountains, including, at the back, &rsquo;Bul ri,\n                        the gathering place of deities, the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">klu</span>, and the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">gnyan</span>. As the place was filled with many springs, herbs\n                        and other auspicious symbols, he decided to build a new monastery there,\n                        which he did in 1918. A brag sNang gsal Monastery was thus established.</p>\n\n                     <p>He then established the monastic discipline in the establishment with the\n                        establishment of the Three Trainings. He made pilgrimages to many places,\n                        such as the Four Divisions of Central Tibet (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">dbus gtsang ru\n                           bzhi</span>), Ti se, Bon ri and so forth. He studied various doctrines\n                        under many teachers, irrespective of their sects, including &rsquo;Gro mgon Shes\n                        rab g-yung drung, bZod pa rgyal mtshan, and the great treasure-discoverer of\n                        A dbang, Rig &rsquo;dzin rgya mtsho, who was a Buddhist priest. He received from\n                        them the threefold lineages &ldquo;initiation, transmission and explanation of\n                        texts&rdquo; of the entire doctrine of inner, outer and secret. All the good deeds\n                        he had learned and performed over a decade led him to a state of knowledge\n                        of the most excellent quality. Every sign of his achievement thrilled the\n                        common people. Since he had obtained omniscience and omnipotence, he came to\n                        be known everywhere as the one who would save all the people in this and the\n                        next life, by the designation of A bla sNang gsal, from Khyung lung dNgul\n                        mkhar in the west to mTsho sngon in Amdo in the east.</p>\n\n                     <p>As for the account of his previous lives, his origin is traced back to Tshad\n                        med &rsquo;od ldan in the time of gShen. The line then leads successively down to\n                        sTong rgyung mthu chen in the time of Bla chen Dran pa nam mkha&rsquo; in the\n                        early stage of Bonpo dissemination, and sPyang sprul Nam mkha&rsquo; rgyal mtshan\n                        in the latter stage of Bonpo dissemination. To make the long story of his\n                        life short: he trained himself in the three deeds of hearing, thinking and\n                        meditating, and moved on into the three deeds of teaching, debating and\n                        writing; he preached extensively for his own sake and for the sake of\n                        others, which was openly praised everywhere, in consequence of which he\n                        turned into the one like the vast ocean of summer.</p>\n\n                     \n\n                        "},{"title":"Main religious objects and activities of the monastery:","index":3,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n\n                        \n\n                           "},{"title":"Shar gling sham po lha rtse.","index":4,"parent_index":3,"body":"\n\n                           <p>At the centre of this mezzanine-high building was a gilt-bronze statue\n                              of sTon pa Khri gtsug rgyal ba as tall as a mezzanine.
