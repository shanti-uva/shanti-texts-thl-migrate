The overlapping upper courses of stonework indicate that this structure was originally not much taller than it is today. It is very likely to have had a stone roof. Inside FS1 are four small spaces that were either used for sleeping or to accommodate burials or the deposition of relics. These compartments constitute a highly unusual design trait not encountered elsewhere in Upper Tibet. <\/p> <p>Within 30 m of FS1 there are three highly deteriorated constructions. These may possibly be the faint remains of mountaintop cubic tombs. They have the following dimensions and characteristics: <\/p> <ol> <li>Funerary structure FS2: (1.6 m x 1.9 m) has been reduced to its base.<\/li> <li>Funerary structure FS3: (3 m x 3 m) has been leveled to its 50 cm high base. FS2 appears to have been oriented in the cardinal directions.<\/li> <li>Funerary structure FS4: (1.5 m x 1.8 m) has been reduced to its crumbling base. <\/li> <\/ol> <p>In addition to these four structures, there may be other structural traces on the same rocky slope. <\/p>  "}]}
