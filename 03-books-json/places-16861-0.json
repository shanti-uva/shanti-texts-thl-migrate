The <span class=\"popular\">Tremo Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Spre mo mkhar</span> hilltop is the only place in the middle of the celebrated pilgrimage place known to the Bonpo as <span class=\"popular\">Gangri Tso Sum</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gangs ri mtsho gsum</span>where its three main sacred geographic features, <span class=\"popular\">Gangkar Tisé</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gangs dkar ti se</span>, <span class=\"popular\">Tso Mapang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mtsho ma pang</span> and <span class=\"popular\">Pori Ngeden</span><span class=\"scholar\">Spos ri ngad ldan</span>, can be seen simultaneously. All four structures of <span class=\"popular\">Tremo Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Spre mo mkhar</span> are built of uncut variable-length tan blocks laid in random-rubble courses. The identification of these structures is hampered by the very poor state of the extant remains. They appear to be either representatives of the cubic tomb typology or closely related monuments. There is an old <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma ṇi</span> wall on he summit of <span class=\"popular\">Tremo Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Spre mo mkhar</span>, which may have been constructed to symbolically and ritually bring <span class=\"popular\">Tremo Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Spre mo mkhar</span> under the auspices of Buddhism.</p>

   "body": "<p>On the north slope of the hill, approximately 20 m below the lower west summit, there is a square masonry structure (3.3 m x 3.3 m), which is about 70 cm in height (FS1). The overlapping upper courses of stonework indicate that this structure was originally not much taller than it is today. It is very likely to have had a stone roof. Inside FS1 are four small spaces that were either used for sleeping or to accommodate burials or the deposition of relics. These compartments constitute a highly unusual design trait not encountered elsewhere in Upper Tibet. </p>
<p>Within 30 m of FS1 there are three highly deteriorated constructions. These may possibly be the faint remains of mountaintop cubic tombs. They have the following dimensions and characteristics: </p>
<ol> <li>Funerary structure FS2: (1.6 m x 1.9 m) has been reduced to its base.</li> <li>Funerary structure FS3: (3 m x 3 m) has been leveled to its 50 cm high base. FS2 appears to have been oriented in the cardinal directions.</li> <li>Funerary structure FS4: (1.5 m x 1.8 m) has been reduced to its crumbling base. </li> </ol>
<p>In addition to these four structures, there may be other structural traces on the same rocky slope. </p>
