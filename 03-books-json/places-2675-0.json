These four then joined with several other tribes of the area,\n                     including &rsquo;Bri ru, sBra chen and sTeng chen, to be united into the so-called\n                     Thirty-nine Tribes (Tsho ba so dgu), which is very famous in Tibetan history.\n                     In the middle of the Ming Dynasty during the time of the Phag mo gru pa, the\n                     Thirty-nine Tribes was were absorbed into the Mongolian Tumed and Khalkha\n                     tribes in mTsho sngon.

In 1916, the Tibetan government\n                     established the post of governor-general of Hor (Hor spyi khyab), and put part\n                     of the Thirty-nine Tribes under its control. But in 1942, the Tibetan\n                     government abolished the post of governor-general of Hor and divided the\n                     Thirty-nine Tribes into six divisions and sNye rong rdzong is one of the six.\n                     On August 1st, 1960, the sNye rong rdzong office was established.</p>\n\n                  \n\n                     "},{"title":"(9) sNang gsal Monastery","index":3,"parent_index":2,"body":"\n\n                     <p>A brag sNang gsal g-yung drung gsal ba&rsquo;i gling is under the jurisdiction of\n                        Dar &rsquo;dzum <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">xiang</span> (also known as mTsho dbyang <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">qu</span>), which lies more than twenty kilometres to the north\n                        of sNye rong rdzong. Although it is not very far, it takes more than an hour\n                        to get there by car because of the terribly muddy road, which makes the\n                        going difficult. This monastery is set in a fairly good natural\n                        environment.</p>\n\n                     <p>The monastery was founded in 1906. The predecessor of this monastery was\n                        sMad sog gYung drung &rsquo;dzin pa&rsquo;i gling (ruins of an ancient monastery near\n                        Nag chu kha were recently identified as those of this monastery) which was\n                        founded by Khyung po A bla grags pa and Sha ba sang grol. It was prosperous,\n                        with hundreds of monks and nuns. In spite of the extensive work devoted to\n                        the three noble deeds &ldquo;keeping, defending and spreading the teachings of\n                        Eternal Bon&rdquo; through generations of lamas, the monastery was upset by,\n                        needless to say, the troops of the Mongolian Jungar. During that time the\n                        Mongolians subjected the two Khyung po lamas, dBu se and dBu nag, to\n                        imprisonment and eventually murdered these two faultless lamas. The sight of\n                        this incident made their great many followers tremble and the lives of their\n                        followers subsequently fell into hopelessness.</p>\n\n                     <p>Then a monastery called Khri dkar was set up on the bank of the Yag chu\n                        river and the teachings of Bon were spread by several generations of lamas.\n                        Destiny, however, reduced the monastery to a deteriorated state. Khyung po\n                        bsTan rgyal grags pa then laid the foundation for the next one at Khyung\n                        rdzong, situated at Gad ngas la, and maintained it for a while, but it, too,\n                        collapsed in the Eleventh Rab byung.</p>\n\n                     <p>Then Mi &rsquo;gyur grags pa, rGyal skyid grags pa, Nyi dbang, lHa dbang, Tshe\n                        dbang g-yung drung and others, all from Khyung po, established the residence\n                           (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">bla brang</span>) of Khyung po sBra nag in A stod\n                        district, which burdened them with the expectations of many proponents of\n                        Eternal Bon that their thirst for a monastery would be satisfied.</p>\n\n                     <p>In 1882, a miraculous baby, who emitted many auspicious signs, was born to a\n                        couple, Khyung dkar gDung pa lha bu, the father, and Gur bza&rsquo; dPal &rsquo;dzoms,\n                        the mother. The baby was called Nam mkha&rsquo; rgyal mtshan. From childhood he\n                        stood out prominently among other children, with his varied talents. Endowed\n                        with auspicious signs, he was praised by everyone. Until the age of\n                        twenty-five, he lived as a herdsman in the manner of a yogi in order to\n                        avoid being possessed by unclean transmigratory existence. At that time, his\n                        parents repeatedly murmured their hope that their son would succeed to the\n                        leadership of the family, but he did not accept this, for he wanted to take\n                        an oath to become a monk.</p>\n\n                     <p>In 1906, Nam mkha&rsquo; rgyal mtshan was ordained in the presence of sMon rgyal\n                        Nam mkha&rsquo; dbang rgyal in rDza khog. In his mind, he conceived the idea of\n                        building a monastery at a certain rocky place surrounded by many\n                        outstandingly sacred sites such as the meditation cave of the great lama\n                        Dran pa nam mkha&rsquo;, his foot-prints and the like. Then a prophecy was made by\n                        the yogi A lo, and in accordance with it, in 1911 Nam mkha&rsquo; rgyal mtshan\n                        went to seek the place where a new monastery should be built.</p>\n\n                     <p>It was a place with many auspicious signs, such as the following: to the\n                        right, lHa ri spang mtho, whose summit consists of a crystal rock; at the\n                        front, Un chen dur krod nor bu spungs ri and gNyan chen wa ra, which look\n                        like dextral white conchs; and mountains, including, at the back, &rsquo;Bul ri,\n                        the gathering place of deities, the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">klu</span>, and the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">gnyan</span>. As the place was filled with many springs, herbs\n                        and other auspicious symbols, he decided to build a new monastery there,\n                        which he did in 1918. A brag sNang gsal Monastery was thus established.</p>\n\n                     <p>He then established the monastic discipline in the establishment with the\n                        establishment of the Three Trainings. He made pilgrimages to many places,\n                        such as the Four Divisions of Central Tibet (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">dbus gtsang ru\n                           bzhi</span>), Ti se, Bon ri and so forth. He studied various doctrines\n                        under many teachers, irrespective of their sects, including &rsquo;Gro mgon Shes\n                        rab g-yung drung, bZod pa rgyal mtshan, and the great treasure-discoverer of\n                        A dbang, Rig &rsquo;dzin rgya mtsho, who was a Buddhist priest. He received from\n                        them the threefold lineages &ldquo;initiation, transmission and explanation of\n                        texts&rdquo; of the entire doctrine of inner, outer and secret. All the good deeds\n                        he had learned and performed over a decade led him to a state of knowledge\n                        of the most excellent quality. Every sign of his achievement thrilled the\n                        common people. Since he had obtained omniscience and omnipotence, he came to\n                        be known everywhere as the one who would save all the people in this and the\n                        next life, by the designation of A bla sNang gsal, from Khyung lung dNgul\n                        mkhar in the west to mTsho sngon in Amdo in the east.</p>\n\n                     <p>As for the account of his previous lives, his origin is traced back to Tshad\n                        med &rsquo;od ldan in the time of gShen. The line then leads successively down to\n                        sTong rgyung mthu chen in the time of Bla chen Dran pa nam mkha&rsquo; in the\n                        early stage of Bonpo dissemination, and sPyang sprul Nam mkha&rsquo; rgyal mtshan\n                        in the latter stage of Bonpo dissemination. To make the long story of his\n                        life short: he trained himself in the three deeds of hearing, thinking and\n                        meditating, and moved on into the three deeds of teaching, debating and\n                        writing; he preached extensively for his own sake and for the sake of\n                        others, which was openly praised everywhere, in consequence of which he\n                        turned into the one like the vast ocean of summer.</p>\n\n                     \n\n                        "},{"title":"Main religious objects and activities of the monastery:","index":4,"parent_index":3,"body":"\n\n                        \n\n                           "},{"title":"Shar gling sham po lha rtse.","index":5,"parent_index":4,"body":"\n\n                           <p>At the centre of this mezzanine-high building was a gilt-bronze statue\n                              of sTon pa Khri gtsug rgyal ba as tall as a mezzanine.

This is one of the Bonpo monasteries that has a long\n                        history. It was destroyed in 1641 when Mongolian troops led by Gushri Khan\n                        bsTan &rsquo;dzin chos rgyal invaded Tibet. Reconstruction was undertaken in\n                        1917.</p>\n\n                     <p>In the time of gNya&rsquo; khri btsan po, the teachings of Bon became widespread\n                        in Tibet. During this period, however, the monastery experienced a rise and\n                        fall, and met with great misfortune in that many masters of Bon gshen\n                        scattered to mDo khams and the nomad area because of the religious\n                        oppression by bTsan po Khri srong lde btsan. In the nomad area, those Bon\n                        gshen masters who had escaped established many monastic communities in order\n                        to get a foot-hold there, so that the precious teachings of Eternal Bon did\n                        not degenerate. At that time Khyung po A bla grags pa and Sha ba rang grol,\n                        who both came from the upper Dwang ra Khyung rdzong, established Sog gYung\n                        drung &rsquo;dzin pa&rsquo;i gling monastery and greatly increased the number of monks.\n                        The three deeds of keeping, defending and spreading the precious teachings\n                        of Eternal Bon became widespread everywhere.</p>\n\n                     <p>However, at the same time, Gushri bsTan &rsquo;dzin chos rgyal first captured mDo\n                        khams and then gradually penetrated gTsang by waging war against Karma bstan\n                        skyong dbang po, the king of gTsang, and brought it under his control.</p>\n\n                     <p>In 1642, the Tibetan government began to organize itself and the doctrine of\n                        the dGe lugs pa sect began to spread widely in Tibet. Simultaneously, a\n                        large number of monastic communities of the bKa&rsquo; rgyud pa and Eternal Bon\n                        were, as a matter of course, destroyed by the military power of Gushri bsTan\n                        &rsquo;dzin chos rgyal. Many Bonpo monks and nuns were ferociously tortured and\n                        eventually murdered. After that, although Khyung po bsTan rgyal grags pa,\n                        Khri bde gung grags and Khyung po &rsquo;Bun snang tried their best to practise\n                        the three deeds &ldquo;keeping, defending and spreading the teachings&rdquo; they\n                        gradually declined. </p>\n\n                     <p>At that time, Khyung po Nang chen grags pa brought the statue Zhi kro rgyab\n                        bkrod and other religious objects to A smad district and took care of the\n                        monastery of Khyung po sBa nag bla brang. Khyung po sMan ri grags pa, gShen\n                        sras grags pa and sNang gsal grags pa are said to have followed successively\n                        in the line of this Bla brang.</p>\n\n                     <p>A brag sPyi ba grags pa then put up a yak-hair tent on the pastureland so\n                        that they could declare that their monastery was settled there. They raised\n                        funds and scraped together enough monastic implements, including the\n                        offerings to the deities and costumes for religious dance. Besides that,\n                        they also obtained many religious objects such as the Zhi khro rgyab bkrod\n                        and other invaluable relics. Gathering a number of devotees in the nomad\n                        area, they performed prayer services and rituals to the satisfaction of the\n                        people.</p>\n\n                     <p>There were about twenty, mostly tantric practitioners, but some of them were\n                        real monks. They practised chanting and meditation. They performed religious\n                        services based on the ritual cycles of dBal gsas, gTso mchog, Phur pa, sTag\n                        la and Byams ma. They also propitiated Srid pa rgyal mo drel nag, Mi bdud, A\n                        bse, rGyal po Nyi pang sad and dGra bla&rsquo;i rgyal mo. Since they performed\n                        these rituals extensively, the monastery became the object of worship for\n                        the people, for this life and hereafter.</p>\n\n                     <p>From among these lamas came bsTan &rsquo;dzin grags pa in the lineage of sBra nag\n                        bla brang, who had accomplished complete deliverance from every attachment\n                        of this world. But after his leaving for the purest land Bon dbyings (after\n                        his death), even the sBra nag bla brang lineage fell into a state like that\n                        of a rosary broken into pieces. Later on, this situation caused the sBra nag\n                        bla brang to invite, willingly or unwillingly, lamas of the Khyung po\n                        lineage from A stod district.</p>\n\n                     <p>About the same time, in 1880, dBang phyug gYung drung tshul khrims, an\n                        accomplished yogi of the Nag ru lineage, one of the three lineages of Khyung\n                        po &ldquo;White, Black and Yellow&rdquo; was born, emitting many auspicious signs. From\n                        childhood, gYung drung tshul khrims had inborn knowledge quite unlike all\n                        other children. Being a master in the fields of calligraphy and arithmetic,\n                        he became the one most admired by all the laity and priests.

During his stay he\n                        fasted on the tenth day of every month, and made flower-offerings. Having\n                        seen this, some senior Bonpo took it as being most important for them and\n                        adopted it as a part of their collective works. The accomplished saint\n                        repeatedly shouted out an oath to the territorial deities such as Ri rgan\n                        Bum rdza se mo, and made them take vows so that they would protect the\n                        peaceful communities. </p>\n\n                     <p>Later, when the great abbot of sMan ri, Nyi ma bstan &rsquo;dzin, came to rDza\n                        dmar, he not only urged and explained the necessity of building a monastery\n                        there, he also made the most careful preparations he could afford.</p>\n\n                     <p>Then another great abbot of mKhar sna (No.7), &rsquo;Gro mgron Shes rab g-yung\n                        drung, came to rDza dmar and built a five-storey stupa at bKra shis na mo\n                        che. In addition to this, he identified the sacred hill on which a monastery\n                        should be built, and made a thorough investigation of the place.</p>\n\n                     <p>The story of the origin of the name rDza dmar Sha ri goes as follows: Once\n                        when gShen gSang ba &rsquo;dus pa captured some witches, he bound them all firmly\n                        to a chicken-shaped rock, on the part that looked like the head of a bird.\n                        But two of them, Me bza&rsquo; brag sbyor and Chu bza&rsquo; rlung sbyor, managed to\n                        escape, barely, and disguised themselves as deer. Later, however, gSang ba\n                        &rsquo;dus pa killed them with his sword, which made him famous as a deer hunter,\n                        Sha ba ri (hence the name Sha ri).</p>\n\n                     <p>To the south of rDza dmar Sha ri there is a rocky mountain called Tshe bum\n                        in which a number of treasures are kept, including the magical objects of\n                        sTag la me &rsquo;bar, the mysterious stick of &rsquo;Od ldan &rsquo;bar ba and the like.</p>\n\n                     <p>To the east is Shel rdzong, the abode of Yum chen Thugs rje Byams ma.

The monastery suffered greatly, on the brink of\n                        annihilation.</p>\n\n                     <p>At that time, in the course of a discussion involving officials, citizens\n                        and monks, an expectation grew that sKam Tshe dbang &rsquo;gyur med (generally\n                        called sKam &rsquo;Gyur dga&rsquo; Rinpoche) would restore and maintain the monastery.\n                        They told him the essentials of the discussion, which he fully accepted.</p>\n\n                     <p>Tshe dbang &rsquo;gyur med was exceedingly venerable; he had taken the monastic\n                        oaths in the presence of the abbot of sMan ri, Phun tshogs blo gros, had\n                        studied under many great teachers and had completed the quintessence of the\n                        three Sutra, Tantra and rDzogs chen. For the sake of all beings, he spread\n                        the teachings of gShen widely, so that his fame reached every part of the\n                        Bonpo community. All Bonpo experienced such heartfelt gratification that\n                        they respected him as their head.</p>\n\n                     <p>He spent everything that had been given to him by many patrons and\n                        proponents, lay and clergy, solely on good deeds. Since there was no choice\n                        but for the monastery to be transferred to another place and rebuilt, the\n                        great abbot of sMan ri, Nyi ma dbang rgyal, and some others inspected Nor bu\n                        gdong, the plain below Ri rgan bum rdza. However, the officials, citizens\n                        and monks of rDza dmar all raised an objection to this with the reason that\n                        the place was too far from Ge mo where the lord Kham pa Ge khod resided,\n                        along with other reasons. A discussion was then held among Tshe dbang &rsquo;gyur\n                        med, Zhwa khra &rsquo;Chi med, the chieftain of rDza dmar, and Kham pa Ge khod,\n                        the chieftain of Ge mo. They reached an agreement to build the monastery\n                        midway between rDza dmar and Ge mo.</p>\n\n                     <p>As almost all the religious objects of the monastery except for one set\n                        manuscript of the <em xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\">bKa&rsquo; &rsquo;gyur </em>and <em xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\">bKa&rsquo; brten</em> and some fine incense had been\n                        dispersed by that time, sKam &rsquo;Gyur dga&rsquo; began to gather together the\n                        religious objects and the people and the government of rDza dmar began to\n                        work on the temple. Since they participated in the construction in this way,\n                        the religious objects and the temple were soon nearly completed, when sKam\n                        &rsquo;Gyur dga&rsquo; was struck down with an illness. Taking over his work, two of his\n                        disciples, bSod nams lhun grub and Nam mkha&rsquo; rgyal mtshan of the sKam clan,\n                        completed the task.</p>\n\n                     <p>With respect to the family of sKam, it is known to be in the line of the\n                        sGo, one of the five great clans of early Tibet: sGa, sGo, gDong, dBra and\n                        &rsquo;Bru. The forefather of the sKam transformed himself into a deity&rsquo;s\n                        offspring called dGa&rsquo; ba mdangs ldan, and descended to this world for the\n                        sake of religious trainees, so that they would be led by the clear light of\n                        the deity. In order to tame the devil Bhyo ra nag po, he came down to a\n                        place called Yul bla ra na se with a turquoise drum booming in his hand.\n                        There he was known by the name of sGo rgyal lha bon thod dkar.</p>\n\n                     <p>The reason why he was known by the name of sKam is as follows: there was\n                        once a time when the lake Dwang ra g-yu mtsho overflowed naturally, and sGo\n                        rgyal lha bon thod dkar appeared and demonstrated his acquired ability by\n                        drying up the flood. After this, his clan came to be called by the name of\n                        sKam (which means drying).</p>\n\n                     <p>Subsequently, in some districts, including Dwang ra g-yu mtsho, sDe dge, and\n                        Hor sBra chen, men of the sKam family through successive generations became\n                        the most talented leaders. It is said that that there have been some 180\n                        masters in the sKam family, such as sGo A lod shig gzan, gYung drung nyi\n                        rgyal, the tutor of Nyi ma bstan &rsquo;dzin, the great abbot of sMan ri; sKam\n                        Khro rgyal grags pa, Nyi ma rgyal mtshan, the abbot of So brgyad, and\n                        others.</p>\n\n                     <p>The way in which the sKam family formed the foundation of prosperity in the\n                        Hor sBra chen district was as follows: Once when a quarrel was provoked in\n                        the sDe dge district between sKam bsTan &rsquo;dzin gtsug phud and Ga lhug, the\n                        chieftain of dKar shul, they asked the king of sDe dge at lHa thog to deal\n                        with it. sKam bsTan &rsquo;dzin gtsug phud won the decision that the monastery\n                        should be exempt from taxation. Hearing this, the chieftain of dKar shul\n                        developed a hatred for him, and threatened that no monk would be allowed in\n                        the monastery. However, sKam bsTan &rsquo;dzin gtsug phud felt generous enough to\n                        leave an excellent mark at the rTsi chu river as witness of his spiritual\n                        accomplishment. The Hor lineage eagerly wanted to leave for rTa sgo in upper\n                        Nag tshang. However at that time, Nyi ma rgyal mtshan, the elder son of the\n                        religious teacher of the Klu phug monastery in the Hor sBra chen district,\n                        repeatedly expressed his hope that he would fix his permanent abode in Hor\n                        sBra chen. Because of this, sKam bsTan &rsquo;dzin gtsug phud took up permanent\n                        residence in the Hor sBra chen district so that he could give full support\n                        to the hope of Nyi ma rgyal mtshan. Descendants of sKam gradually increased\n                        and the teachings of gShen became widespread in rDza dmar in the sNye rong\n                        district. The reputation of the sKam family thus came to be widely known in\n                        Hor sBra chen.</p>\n\n                     \n\n                        "},{"title":"Structure and religious objects of the monastery","index":18,"parent_index":17,"body":"\n\n                        <p>The monastery consisted of the following buildings: the assembly hall\n                           with four long pillars and sixteen short ones; two temples, rNam rgyal\n                           lha khang and Dran pa lha khang, each with four long pillars and four\n                           short ones; the two-storey <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">bla brang</span>; the meditation\n                           hall; and the large quarters for monks.</p>\n\n                        <p>Formerly, this monastery possessed an abundance of religious objects\n                           including the following: a sacred gilt-bronze statue of gShen rab rNam\n                           par rgyal ba as tall as a two-storey house, the Four Buddhas of\n                           gilt-bronze and a gilt-bronze statue of gShen rab Mi bo.

At the same time, he studied under many excellent masters of several\n                        monasteries. Since he respected them as his chief masters and received\n                        profound initiations, text-transmissions and religious teachings, he reached\n                        a state worthy of praise from everyone.</p>\n\n                     <p>Then he went to see lHo rTogs ldan dkar po, whose name was widely known.

The three brothers invited the saint lHun grup\n                        dbang ldan into their tent, and the elder one, Khro bo rgyal, said,</p>\n\n                     <p>&ldquo;Happiness is welling up inside me at the very sight of you,</p>\n\n                     <p>Flowing through my body is energy that I have never felt before,</p>\n\n                     <p>I would like to remember what name you bear,</p>\n\n                     <p>I prostrate myself with reverence,</p>\n\n                     <p>I wonder what caused me to suffer from illness,</p>\n\n                     <p>I beg from you the best divinatory service to turn my illness away.&rdquo;</p>\n\n                     <p>lHun grup dbang ldan said in reply: &ldquo;I am the one called lHun grup dbang\n                        ldan, but I am not the one who tells whether the divination comes out good\n                        or bad. What I can do for you is to give you medical treatment.&rdquo; Then he\n                        made an examination of urine and faeces, and gave the most careful medical\n                        treatment to satisfy the elder brother&rsquo;s wishes.</p>\n\n                     <p>Forty-nine days later the patient finally got far better than their\n                        expectation, which, at the same time, raised faith and reverence in the\n                        brothers&rsquo; minds. Though they repeatedly asked him what kind of thing he\n                        wanted as a doctor&rsquo;s fee, he said &ldquo;I do not need any kind of doctor&rsquo;s fee,\n                        but I have a wish to build a monastery in accordance with the prophecy made\n                        previously by the superior saint. Therefore I shall request you to give me a\n                        small piece of land where a monastery could be built. The three brothers\n                        were so happy to hear his words that they said, &ldquo;We shall do as you tell\n                        us.&rdquo;</p>\n\n                     <p>Then the saint lHun grup dbang ldan, accompanied by the three brothers, went\n                        on to examine all the area under their jurisdiction within the Sog district,\n                        and encamped for a night at a place called Pha bong thang, where they saw\n                        many auspicious manifestations that night.</p>\n\n                     <p>Therefore, in 1797, a decision was made to establish a monastery on this\n                        distinctive land. The future monastery was given a good name, the Glorious\n                        Nor bu gling, and an elaborate purification ritual was performed.</p>\n\n                     <p>With regard to the surroundings of this square piece of land, they appear to\n                        be very good, described as follows: to the east is the protective mountain\n                        rGya stag khro bo, a white rocky mountain with the appearance of a haughty\n                        tiger that is thirsty, to the north is the protective Rus sbal ser po, a\n                        meadowy hill shining like a hero&rsquo;s helmet, to the west is the protective Bya\n                        dmar mtshal lu, a beautiful scarlet hill of slate mingled with verdigris, to\n                        the south is the protective gYu &rsquo;brug sngon po, a blue rocky mountain\n                        sticking high into the sky.</p>\n\n                     <p>All the lamas, leaders, patrons and priests were summoned, and worked\n                        without being lazy or negligent. Because of this, they managed to build the\n                        assembly hall of the monastery within the very year of the decision being\n                        taken. Not only that, by mutual agreement among the assembled monks of the\n                        Three Trainings, they increased the number of monks from four to six, then\n                        gradually from six to thirteen. In the early days, when there were only four\n                        monks, they were called &ldquo;the four young qualified ones&rdquo; (mTshan ldan khye&rsquo;u\n                        bzhi), when six, &ldquo;the six gShen who guide the beings&rdquo; (&rsquo;Dul ba gShen drug),\n                        and when increased to thirteen, they came to be known everywhere as &ldquo;the\n                        thirteen gShen&rdquo; (Ye gshen bcu gsum). From that time, the Bon doors of outer,\n                        inner and secret were opened and the great tradition of the teachings of\n                        chanting services and meditation came to be established, especially the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">rNam rgyal</span> and <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">gYung drung klong\n                           rgyas</span> which were performed according to the tradition established by\n                        the former adepts. This contributed to the increase of the monastery&rsquo;s\n                        activities and the spread of Eternal Bon.</p>\n\n                     <p>The lineage of the monastery is as follows:</p>\n\n                     <ol type=\"1\">\n                        <li> lHun grub dbang ldan, the founder of the monastery</li>\n\n                        <li> rGyal tshab lHun grub &rsquo;od zer</li>\n\n                        <li> bKra shis tshul khrims</li>\n\n                        <li> Tshul khrims &rsquo;od zer</li>\n\n                        <li> dPal ldan tshul khrims</li>\n\n                        <li> gYung drung rgyal ba</li>\n\n                        <li> mChog gyur grub dbang bsTan &rsquo;dzin rin chen nam mkha&rsquo; bde chen snying\n                           po</li>\n\n                        <li> bsTan &rsquo;dzin rgyal dbang</li>\n\n                        <li> bsTan &rsquo;dzin lhun grub </li>\n\n                        <li> Kun dga&rsquo; dbang ldan</li>\n\n                        <li> Kun mkhyen Sangs rgyas grags pa</li>\n\n                        <li> mNyam med Tshul khrims grags pa</li>\n\n                        <li> bsTan pa&rsquo;i nyi ma</li>\n                     </ol>\n\n                     \n\n                        "},{"title":"The size of the monastery and its religious objects","index":21,"parent_index":20,"body":"\n\n                        \n\n                           "},{"title":"’Du khang ka dgu ma","index":22,"parent_index":21,"body":"\n\n                           <p>At the centre of this assembly hall, built by bsTan &rsquo;dzin rin chen bde\n                              chen snying po, was a gilt-bronze statue of rNam par rgyal ba, about\n                              the height of an eight-year-old child.
