It has many highly unusual design and construction features, making it of particular interest. To the south the site is hemmed in by a low-lying ridge hat blocks views of the <span class=\"popular\">Ngangla Ringtso<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Ngang la ring mtsho<\/span> basin and the Transhimalaya. The beautifully constructed edifice measures 7.2 m to 7.4 m on each of its four sides. Its current height is around 5.8 m and it does not appear to have been much taller originally. <span class=\"popular\">Bumo Lhakhang<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Bu mo lha khang<\/span> has an open plan interior (5.6 m x 5.6 m). The robustly built walls are around 80 cm in hickness. The nature of the wall construction and spans involved indicate that <span class=\"popular\">Bumo Lhakhang<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Bu mo lha khang<\/span> possessed a wooden frame roof. <\/p> <p>The existence of a variety of funerary superstructures in close proximity to the <span class=\"popular\">Bumo Lhakhang<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Bu mo lha khang<\/span> edifice, suggest that this high-elevation structure had a mortuary function. This is also indicated by the oral tradition and the placement of the building in a wide-open plain. Archaic residential sites were much more commonly located in hard-to-reach, defensible locales, while such open ground was usually reserved for burial. <span class=\"popular\">Bumo Lhakhang<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Bu mo lha khang<\/span>, therefore, may have functioned as a temple-tomb or mausoleum. Its usage for ongoing cultural activities seems suggested by the presence of window openings. <span class=\"popular\">Bumo Lhakhang<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Bu mo lha khang<\/span> has been placed in the residential division of sites because of his possible habitational function as well as the domiciliary functions attributed to it in the oral tradition. <\/p> "},{"title":"Oral tradition","index":5,"parent_index":2,"body":null},{"title":"Site elements","index":6,"parent_index":2,"body":" "},{"title":"Edifice","index":7,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p>The lower portion of the four walls of the edifice, a prominent revetment, was built primarily of gray and brown sandstone (generally 20 cm to 60 cm long) configured in a random-rubble fabric. There are also some pieces of white granite in these lower wall courses. The stonework of the exterior walls extends 1.3 m to 1.6 m above ground level on all but the east side of the structure (90 cm high on this side), providing a substantial base. The adhesive used for the stonework is a white clay-based mortar. The superstructure consists of light-colored earthen blocks with a bluish cast laid in regular courses. These blocks (45 cm x 25 cm x 8 cm) have high gravel content and are especially hard and resistant to crumbling. The factors explaining this hardness are not immediately apparent. This type of building material has not been detected at any other site in Upper Tibet.<\/p> <p>The current floor of the interior of the structure declines to the east (it is elevated 1.3 m to 3 m above the surrounding terrain). A lip on the floor above the east revetment indicates that, in this direction, the interior was elevated approximately 1.3 m above surrounding terrain. As the interior slopes up towards the west side of the structure, this could possibly indicate that the interior space was split between two or more elevations. This is also suggested by the other sides of the revetment, which are significantly higher than the east base of the building. The seams between each vertical course of earthen blocks (filled with a hard white mortar) are 3 cm to 4 cm thick. The regular courses thus achieved is of a high order of workmanship. There are also traces of a white clay-based plaster on the interior walls (around 3 m in height). In the upper section of he west wall there are two openings that are likely to have become enlarged through damage. There are also various openings in the south and north walls within 1 m of the current top of the structure. Much of the east wall of the superstructure is missing (there is now a 3.9-m wide gap in it), destroying what must have been the entrance to the edifice. <\/p> <p>At the foot of the exterior west wall there are the remains of a slab wall embedded in the surface of the ground. It is quite well centered between the two sides of the edifice. This superficial structure extends 2.2 m from the building in a perpendicular fashion. Parallel slabs of stone (around 25 cm in length) were laid in the ground edgewise to create a wall around 30 cm thick. Such double-course slab walls are a common feature at many archaic funerary sites of Upper Tibet.<\/p> <p>In the Spring of 2004, local <span class=\"popular emph\">drok pa<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">&rsquo;brog pa<\/span> removed many stones from the revetment of <span class=\"popular\">Bumo Lhakhang<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Bu mo lha khang<\/span> and brought hem to their camps. These stones were taken so that mantras could be carved on them. This pilferage has caused much damage to the structure. To the credit of local township (<span class=\"popular emph\">shang<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">shang<\/span>) officials, a meeting was held shortly afterwards and the herders asked to desist from removing stones from the monument.<\/p> "},{"title":"Funerary enclosures","index":8,"parent_index":6,"body":" <p>A rectangular enclosure (6.9 m x 4 m) is located 22 m north of the <span class=\"popular\">Bumo Lhakhang<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Bu mo lha khang<\/span> edifice. The walls of this fragmentary superficial structure contain parallel courses of stones (granite and sandstone) and are 50 cm thick. In some places additional stones were interspersed between the parallel lines of masonry. This structure is flush with the surrounding terrain or slightly elevated above it. There is an analogous double-course enclosure (5.2 m x 6.5 m) situated 69 m east of he edifice. Roughly 70 m southeast of <span class=\"popular\">Bumo Lhakhang<\/span><span class=\"scholar\">Bu mo lha khang<\/span> are possibly the faint traces of two other such structures. These enclosures are probably funerary in nature and belong to the quadrate parallel-course superficial structures typology (II.2b). <\/p> "},{"title":"Tho","index":9,"parent_index":6,"body":null},{"title":"Affiliated sites","index":10,"parent_index":2,"body":null},{"title":"Notes","index":11,"parent_index":0,"body":" <div class=\"footnote\"> <a name=\"n94\" \/> <a href=\"#nb94\" class=\"note\"> [94] <\/a> For a description of the funerary functions of <span class=\"popular emph\">to<\/span><span class=\"scholar emph\">tho<\/span> see Bellezza, <em>Zhang Zhung<\/em>, 492-495. <\/div>  "}]}
