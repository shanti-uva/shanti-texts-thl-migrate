These coffins occupied a large recess in an earthen bluff that rises above a wash. This site is situated is a zone of dissected tablelands located between the <span class=\"popular\">Kandé Chu</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dkar ’ded chu</span> and two hills known as <span class=\"popular\">Ri Lhunpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ri lhun po</span> and <span class=\"popular\">Sechung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Se chung</span>. At the time of the survey, it was discovered that the hole ostensibly containing the coffins had caved in. No structural evidence associated with burials is visible on the surface. The use of wooden coffins seems to point to a different culture and/or period than that associated with the ‘<span class=\"popular\">Mön</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span>’ cist burials. </p><p>In the last 25 to 35 years, the <span class=\"popular\">Ali Tangkha</span><span class=\"scholar\">A li thang kha</span>plain, which is bounded by the <span class=\"popular\">Kandé Chu</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dkar ’ded chu</span>, has been brought back into cultivation. Farmers of this locale report that corpses of the ‘<span class=\"popular\">Mön</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span>’ have been unearthed during plowing. <span class=\"popular\">Ali Tangkha</span><span class=\"scholar\">A li thang kha</span> is part of <span class=\"popular\">Möntser</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon ’tsher</span> (Abandoned <span class=\"popular\">Mön</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span> Lands), a region of western Tibet well known for its so-called <span class=\"popular\">Mön</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span> legacy. </p>",
