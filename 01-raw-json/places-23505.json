History\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eThe monastery was founded by sGom chen gYyung drung rgyal mtshan, he is also\n                        called sTong nyid bya \u0026rsquo;phur. His principal teacher was Zhu sgom \u0026rsquo;phrul zhig\n                        chen po (\u003cspan xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"\u003eKTGN\u003c/span\u003e p.8), a son of Zhu skye se chen po. The\n                        teaching lineage may be traced back to Zhu yas legs po, a famous disciple of\n                        gShen chen Klu dga\u0026rsquo;. Sras lha rje skyid po was a disciple of Zhu yas legs po\n                        and the teacher of Zhu skye se chen po; dGongs mdzod ri khrod chen po,\n                        another disciple of Zhu skye se chen po, was a contemporary of Zhu sgom\n                        \u0026rsquo;phrul zhig chen po. dGongs mdzod ri khrod chen po was born in the the\n                        Earth-Tiger year of the first Rab byung (1038). Since dGongs mdzod ri khrod\n                        chen po and Zhu sgom \u0026rsquo;phrul zhig chen po were both contemporaries of sTong\n                        nyid bya \u0026rsquo;phur who founded the monastery (\u003cspan xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"\u003eTZLD\u003c/span\u003e p.4, \u003cspan xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"\u003eKTGN\u003c/span\u003e p.8), we may assume that the monastery was built at\n                        least nine hundred years ago. From the time of sTong nyis bya \u0026rsquo;phur, the\n                        monastery was run by a continuous succession of abbots for about five\n                        hundred years until the 10th Rab byung (1567-1626) after which the monastery\n                        split into two branches: one headed by dGar ba Bla ma gYung drung rgyal\n                        mtshan regarded as a reincarnation of sTong nyid bya \u0026rsquo;phur, and the other by\n                        rTse zhig A lags Shes rab.

In\n                        addition to the rTse zhig Chos rje, there were three Bla brang which came to\n                        be known as Nang chen gsum, the \u0026ldquo;three residences of the Bla mas\u0026rdquo;. dGar ba\n                        Bla ma gYung drung rgyal mtshan went to study at sMan ri Monastery (No.1).\n                        He returned to rTse zhig Monastery where he taught for many years and became\n                        famed as a teacher throughout the whole of Amdo. Unfortunately, his\n                        reincarnation passed away in childhood. The next incarnation was found in a\n                        child born in sTong chung, Ba yan, northern Amdo (Hua long county in\n                        Qinghai). He does not seem to have lived at rTse zhig but to have remained\n                        in the Ba yan area where he greatly contributed to the spread of Bon and was\n                        locally known as sTong chung Zhabs drung (\u003cspan xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"\u003eTZLD\u003c/span\u003e\n                        p.6).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eThe following incarnation was Zhabs drung bSod nams g-yung drung dbang rgyal\n                        (1894-1949) who was very active on both the religious and political scenes\n                        in Amdo in the early 20th century (cf. To shes Temple, No.118). His\n                        reincarnation is sKal bzang bstan \u0026rsquo;dzin rgya mtsho (also known as A mgon bla\n                        ma or A lags Pad ma) who was born in the Iron-Tiger year of the 16th Rab\n                        byung (1950) into the mGon rgya family of A mgon tribe in Amdo, and who is\n                        the present rTse dbus tshang (\u003cspan xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"\u003eTZLD\u003c/span\u003e p.5). A lags Shes\n                        rab, a contemporary of dGar ba bla ma gYung drung rgyal mtshan founded a\n                        separate Bla brang and visited almost all the Bonpo monasteries in Amdo. In\n                        addition to the Bla brang, he built a three-storey Lha khang at Khyung mo\n                        Monastery (No.123). Rab \u0026rsquo;byams pa Shes rab rnam rgyal, A lags Shes rab\u0026rsquo;s\n                        nephew, was sent as a child to sMan ri Monastery to study under Rin chen\n                        lhun grub and Grub thob Nam mkha\u0026rsquo; lhun grub, and after several years he\n                        obtained the Rab \u0026rsquo;byams pa degree. Unwilling to return to Amdo, he remained\n                        there for most of his life. His uncle, disappointed, concealed the rTen gsum\n                        (three types of sacred objects, viz. images, books and stupas) inside some\n                        statues. Later however A khu rGyal ba, a disciple of A lags Shes rab from\n                        sTong che in Khri ka, went to sMan ri Monastery to beg Shes rab rnam rgyal\n                        to return and take his uncle\u0026rsquo;e place. He accepted and before leaving dPal\n                        ldan ye shes, the sixth Panchen Bla ma, gave him a gold seal and an official\n                        letter giving him authority over all the Bonpo monasteries and communities\n                        in Amdo (\u003cspan xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"\u003eKTGN\u003c/span\u003e p.9, \u003cspan xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"\u003eTZLD\u003c/span\u003e p.9).\n                        According to \u003cspan xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"\u003eTGLR\u003c/span\u003e, he was the seventeenth abbot of the\n                        monastery in the 12th Rab byung. (1687-1746). His reincarnation died in\n                        childhood. The following incarnation was Nam mkha\u0026rsquo; g-yung drung, an\n                        extremely learned Bla ma. Like his predecessors he was invested with\n                        authority over all the Bonpo monasteries in Amdo. He died at the age of\n                        eighty. Nam mkha\u0026rsquo; g-yung drung\u0026rsquo;s reincarnation also died in childhood. The\n                        following incarnation was rTse zhig Khri chen Theg mchog ye shes.

Theg mchog ye shes\u0026rsquo;s reincarnation was Khri ba Kun bzang rgyal\n                        mtshan. Like his predecessors, he too was responsible for all Bonpo\n                        monasteries in Amdo. He died in the thirty-first year of the 16th Rab byung\n                        (1957).
