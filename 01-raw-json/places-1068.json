There \u0026rsquo;Dul ba rgyal mtshan\n                        established a family considered sacred (gdung brgyud) with the name of lCags\n                        mdud situated to the east of the river and below the village of A gling.

Later the temple was extended into a\n                        small monastery.

After thirteen\n                        years of study, the latter sent him back to Amdo. When he arrived in Shar\n                        khog, gTso tshang dbon po and his fifteen disciples came to meet him and\n                        became his disciples. Later he was offered land by the local people and\n                        founded a hermitage at the site called Rin spungs. Later he extended it into\n                        monastery. Towards the end of his life, a thirteen-year old boy called dGe\n                        \u0026rsquo;dun shes rab (b.1811) from dMu dge came to Rin spungs following a vision he\n                        had received in dream. gYung drung bstan rgyal was very enthusiastic about\n                        the new visitor and exhorted his disciples to accept dGe \u0026rsquo;dun shes rab as\n                        his reincarnation after his death. He asked dGe \u0026rsquo;dun shes rab to return to\n                        the monastery in seven years. He is said to have even made an inventory of\n                        all his personal belongings in the presence of dGe \u0026rsquo;dun shes rab, and\n                        ordered the monks to give them to dGe \u0026rsquo;dun shes rab upon his return.\n                        However, dGe \u0026rsquo;dun shes rab did not return seven years later as agreed so\n                        gYung drung bstan rgyas, before his death, left a testament for him in a\n                        small wooden box which he hid in the wall of his meditation cell. Finally,\n                        the monastery sent some monks to dMu dge to talk with dGe \u0026rsquo;dun shes rab\u0026rsquo;s\n                        family who warmly welcomed them and accepted the recognition of their son as\n                        the reincarnation of gYung drung bstan rgyal, but the boy was not at home. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eIn the mean time, dGe \u0026rsquo;dun shes rab had travelled to rGyal rong, Khyung po,\n                        Kong po, lHa sa, rMe\u0026rsquo;u tshang, Dar ldings, Zhu tshang; he studied at rMan ri\n                        for seven years, practiced meditation at Byang gNam mtsho for one year and\n                        Khyung po\u0026rsquo;i sgom grwa for another six years, and had visited many sacred\n                        places and monasteries of different traditions (including Buddhism) where he\n                        studied and practiced meditation with various great masters and acquired the\n                        new name of Shes rab ye shes.

It\n                        regrouped the five former main monasteries: dGa\u0026rsquo; mal, sNa steng (No.199),\n                        Rin sprungs (No.200), sNang zhig dngul sku (No.201), and sKyang tshang\n                        (No.202).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eWhen the assembly hall of the new dGa\u0026rsquo; mal was completed, Shes rab mthar\n                        phyin (b.1933) was chosen to be the abbot and sKal bzang dar rgyas the chief\n                        teacher (bon slob) of the new monastery. The monks of the old dGal\u0026rsquo; mal were\n                        content to cooperate in establishing the new dGa\u0026rsquo; mal. Later, however, the\n                        monks of sKyang tshang, sNang zhig, Rin sprungs, sNa steng and other\n                        monasteries in the area began to rebuild their own monasteries at their\n                        original sites and resumed independent religious activities. This event led\n                        the monks of the old dGa\u0026rsquo; mal to rebuild their own monastery too, although\n                        the two are now located within the same compound.

His\n                        successor was gTso \u0026rsquo;phags Nyi ma rgyal mtshan. After several generations the\n                        gTso tshang lineage was interrupted, but was reestablished with gYung drung\n                        bstan \u0026rsquo;dzin who rebuilt the assembly hall (\u0026rsquo;du khang) in 1862.

Prior to its reopening, its monks\n                        lived in Rin spungs Monastery (No.200), since, according to oral tradition,\n                        Rin spungs was originally a branch of gTso tshang. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eThe reconstruction of gTso tshang was part of the Development Project of the\n                        One Hundred Townships of Sichuan Province launched in 1991 which included\n                        gTso tshang township.
