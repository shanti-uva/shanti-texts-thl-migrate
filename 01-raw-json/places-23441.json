He had turquoise hair and a white chin-tuft; he was dressed in\n                        white silk and was holding a lotus. He was found by the king of China, who\n                        called him Zing ba mthu chen. He became a prelate in the court and came to\n                        have the name Legs tang mang po. bSam gtan rgyal mtshan, one of his\n                        descendants, migrated to Tibet, where he subdued many gods and demons.
