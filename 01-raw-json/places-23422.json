It is therefore apparent\n                        that the monastery was named Ser zhig after the family name of the lama who\n                        founded the monastery in 1405. Ser zhig Monastery is the biggest one in the\n                        Nag tshang Dwang ra g-yu mtsho area. Because of this, the Fifth Dalai Lama\n                        recognized it as a monastery of the government and permitted it to have a\n                        certain number of the local people as its retainers. The monastery is also\n                        called Se zhig skor lde, since it is one of the seven Nag tshang sger\n                        tsho.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eThe monastery consisted of a two-storey temple, the \u003cspan xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"\u003ebla\n                           brang\u003c/span\u003e and monks\u0026rsquo; quarters. There were many religious objects and\n                        books. Besides these, there were religious objects transferred from Nyi lung\n                        \u0026rsquo;gram, the seat of \u0026rsquo;Dzi bon dBang gi rgyal mtshan, when it was destroyed.\n                        However, invaded by the barbarous Mongolian forces of Jungar, Ser zhig\n                        Monastery was turned into a military camp, and the temple and monks\u0026rsquo;\n                        quarters were soon destroyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eAfter that, a number of people launched themselves into its reconstruction,\n                        as well as maintaining the doctrine. They included the one called Zhang\n                        zhung Lama, a descendant of Gu ru lama, a lama of the Zhu family from \u0026rsquo;Jed\n                        spang lung, a lama of the Shel zhig family and others. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eThe main religious objects of the monastery were as follows: a black square\n                        stone called A ma sa gsum with the three white letters A, Ma and Sa on it; a\n                        small conch made of a devotee\u0026rsquo;s teeth; a tooth of the sTon pa gShen rab\u0026rsquo;s\n                        horse with a self-risen letter A on it; a Garuda\u0026rsquo;s claw as big as a yak\u0026rsquo;s\n                        horn; and a self-grown figure of Zhi ba Kun du bzang po within a crystal\n                        stupa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eBesides these, the monastery had a small drum, which is said to be a present\n                        given to a Ser zhig lama by the local deity gDong dmar lha btsan of rTa sgo.\n                        Among the patrons of the monastery it used to be the custom for patrons to\n                        appeal to the abbot to let one of them beat the drum when the ritual Ma tri\n                        bum sgrub was performed, for it was said that if one could beat the drum\n                        three time, he might get rid of all the bad luck or misfortune of the whole\n                        year, and his wish might be fulfilled. The patron was expected to offer five\n                        silver tam kar and a ceremonial scarf for each beat. All the people in the\n                        neighbourhood, lay and clergy, both Buddhists and Bonpo, showed boundless\n                        respect for this drum. At mass meetings, three beats of the drum by the\n                        abbot preceded the chanting; only then was the prayer conductor to begin\n                        leading the chorus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eIn the protector\u0026rsquo;s temple was a mask of the deity A bse, called Nga \u0026rsquo;dra ma.\n                        This designation was derived from the words spoken by the deity to the mask\n                        maker, \u0026ldquo;this mask looks like me\u0026rdquo; (\u003cspan xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"\u003enga \u0026rsquo;dra\u003c/span\u003e), which\n                        turned the mask into an object of great rarity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eIt is said that there were many old, important religious objects in the\n                        monastery, such as the skull of sTon pa gShen rab with a self-produced\n                        letter A on it, his teeth with a self-produced Gu ru on them, a statue of\n                        sTon pa with a self-produced mantra \u003cspan xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"\u003eOm ma ti ma ye sa\n                           le\u0026rsquo;du\u003c/span\u003e on the upper right part of it, and armour that belonged to\n                        sTon pa (said to have been taken to Xian in China).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eThe teaching and practice of this monastery have actually experienced rise\n                        and fall in every stage of its history.
