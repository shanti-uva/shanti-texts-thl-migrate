Name \u003c/h4\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eThe site is locally known as Dung khyung. In certain written sources, such\n                        as the biography of Khri ka Kung bzang rgyal mtshan, it is referred to as\n                        sTong chung and is associated with sTong che in Khri ka. Not sure whether my\n                        interpretation is correct: this association however seems to have been made\n                        by later scholars, because for the local population in both areas the\n                        distance between sTong che in Khri ka and sTong chung in Ba yan is\n                        considerable. The two monasteries probably found out about each other after\n                        most of the Bonpo religious sites in Amdo were converted to the dGe lugs pa\n                        tradition and Bonpo masters began travelling back and forth between the few\n                        Bonpo sanctuaries that remained. With the exception of the biography\n                        mentioned above, the site is not referred to as sTong chung, neither\n                        locally, nor by the people of sTong che. According to another source, there\n                        were two masters in sTong che known as sTon pa che ba and sTon pa chung ba,\n                        \u0026ldquo;elder master\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;younger master\u0026rdquo; and the terms evolved into sTon che and\n                        sTon chung. Thus sTon chung in Ba yan is supposed to have been named after\n                        the younger master who went there. This version seems to be rather\n                        farfetched, and since Khri ka Kun bzang rgyal mtshan is renowned as a\n                        scholar, his version of the name\u0026rsquo;s origin is widely accepted, especially by\n                        the local Bonpo scholars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                  \n\n                  \n\n                     \u003ch4 id=\"b6-3-21-2\"\u003e2.

History\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eAccording to oral tradition, the monastery was originally built on the\n                        present site of Bya khyung Monastery, one of the largest and most important\n                        dGe lugs pa monasteries in Amdo, where Tsong kha pa was ordained. Indeed,\n                        before Bya khyung Monastery was built, there was a Bonpo monastery\n                        surrounded by several villages whose the inhabitants were fervent Bonpo.\n                        When Bya khyung Monastery was built the Bonpo were expelled from the\n                        surrounding villages. They resettled at sTong chung village where they or\n                        their descendents built a large Bonpo monastery which was later destroyed by\n                        Hui Muslims. In the mid-20th century, the lama bDod nams gYung drung dbang\n                        rgyal of rTse zhig began to rebuild the monastery; twelve monks\u0026rsquo; cells and\n                        the residence of the head lama were completed, but then, owing to the\n                        Chinese invasion, the main hall was never finished. The monastery was\n                        eventually rebuilt in 1998 through the efforts of bZod pa bstan pa\u0026rsquo;i rgyal\n                        mtshan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                  \n\n                  \n\n                     \u003ch4 id=\"b6-3-21-4\"\u003e5. Current number of monks\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eThere were six monks in the monastery in 1996.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                  \n\n                  \n\n                     \u003ch4 id=\"b6-3-21-5\"\u003e7.

The latter is considered as\n                        reincarnation, but was not yet formally recognised. There was not any kind\n                        of monastic education when I visited the monastery, but, for historical\n                        reasons, the monastery has close ties with bsTan \u0026rsquo;dzin dbang rgyal of To\n                        shes Temple (No. 118). \u003c/p\u003e\n\n                  \n\n                  \n\n                     \u003ch4 id=\"b6-3-21-6\"\u003eSource\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n                     \n\n                        \u003ch5 id=\"b6-3-21-6-1\"\u003eInterviews: \u003c/h5\u003e\n\n                        \u003cp\u003ebsTan \u0026rsquo;dzin dbang rgyal, the master of To shes Temple and Shar steng\n                           villages, is one of the most learned Bonpo scholars in the Ba yan area.\n                           He was born in 1932 and was recognized as the incarnation of Kun bzang\n                           rin chen of sNang zhig Monastery (No.180).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \n\n                  \n\n               \u003ctable xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\" class=\"navarrows\"\u003e\u003ctbody\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd class=\"leftcell\"\u003e\u003ca class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/global/images/arrow-left.gif\" title=\"Previous Section\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd class=\"midcell\"\u003e\u003ca class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/global/images/arrow-up.gif\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd class=\"rightcell\"\u003e\u003ca class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/global/images/arrow-right.gif\" title=\"Next Section\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003c/tbody\u003e\u003c/table\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"chap-id\"\u003e/bonpo-monasteries/b6-3-21/\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\" class=\"jqmWindow\" id=\"chapRefWindow\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"closebtn\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"height: 280px;\" class=\"conx-content\"\u003e\u003ch3\u003eNote Citation for Page \u003cspan class=\"pgnm\"/\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp class=\"biblref\"\u003eDondrup Lhagyal, Phuntso Tsering Sharyul, Tsering Thar, Charles Ramble, and \n\t\tMarietta Kind, A Survey of Bonpo Monasteries and Temples in\n               Tibet and the Himalaya\n\t\t\t\t(ISBN: ,\t\n\t\t\t\t:, \n\t\t\t\t2010-07-06), \n\t\t\t\t\u003cspan class=\"pgnm\"/\u003e.\n\t\t\t\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eBibliographic Citation\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eDondrup Lhagyal, Phuntso Tsering Sharyul, Tsering Thar, Charles Ramble, and \n\t\tMarietta Kind.
