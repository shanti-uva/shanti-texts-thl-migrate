It was founded in 1864 by bSod nams g-yung\n                        drung, a Tantrist of A skyid, and his assistant, Dar dga\u0026rsquo;. Before the\n                        tantric establishment, it is said that there was a custom of the local\n                        community making offerings on the 15th day of the month at the same site.\n                        bSod nams g-yung drung, the founder of the establishment, belonged to a long\n                        lineage of able Tantric practitioners. He was much respected by the local\n                        people as he was able to perform the funeral rite for the dead and carry out\n                        religious services for the living. Lama Dar dga\u0026rsquo; was also esteemed as he\n                        belonged to the lineage of rMe\u0026rsquo;u.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eAs the main tutelary deity of the establishment was dBal phur nag po, it was\n                        called Phur nag. The temple and assembly hall had their religious objects\n                        and were fully equipped. In the temple there were statues of gSas mkhar\n                        mchog lnga and Bonpo religious protectors in all their majesty. As there was\n                        a fair number of Tantric practitioners in Phur nag it was one of the three\n                        famous Tantric establishments in the Hor region known as Klu rTing Phur\n                        gsum, i.e. Klu phug (No.31), rTing ngu (No.12) and Phur nag (No.30). The\n                        ritual tradition of Phur nag followed closely those of the families gShen,\n                        Bru, Zhu and rMe\u0026rsquo;u.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eThe monastery has murals of its own protective local deities, which are as\n                        follows:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003col type=\"1\"\u003e\n                        \u003cli\u003e rGyal mtshan po: a deity with one head and two arms.
