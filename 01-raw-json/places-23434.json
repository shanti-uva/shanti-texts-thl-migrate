Klu phug then with its mKhar dmar bla\n                        brang became a real monastery and the abbot gave it the name gShen bstan\n                        gYung drung bde chen gling and wrote a monastic code for it entitled the \u003cspan xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"\u003eThar lam them skas\u003c/span\u003e, setting out regulations in\n                        accordance with the Bonpo monastic tradition.

He entrusted the monastic management to Ma bdud btsan rgyal bzhi,\n                        the Bonpo protectors, and bestowed upon the monastery a large flat bell\n                        discovered in rGyal rong Brag steng and it has been one of the principal\n                        religious objects of this monastery up to the present day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003ebsTan \u0026rsquo;dzin dbang grags maintained the time-honoured custom of mKhar dmar\n                        bla brang, except that the twelve tantrists were now all monks.

In his childhood, he was recognized as the\n                        reincarnation of a high lama in rGyal rong. So a number of gifts, including\n                        a copy of the \u003cspan xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"\u003eKhams chen\u003c/span\u003e, written in gold, were\n                        presented to Khri dbang rab brtan, the sixteenth king of Hor, in the hope\n                        that he would permit the child to leave for rGyal rong. However, the king\n                        was powerful enough to hold back the child (his own son) from leaving and\n                        returned the gifts. So bsTan pa dar rgyas eventually decided himself to\n                        become a monk and later ascended the throne of Klu phug Monastery.

Following this,\n                        religious dances were performed, to which he added new dances: sNang bgyad,\n                        Tshogs \u0026rsquo;cham, and the Yamantaka.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003erNam rgyal dbang \u0026rsquo;dus, a brother of bsTan pa dar rgyas, entered the\n                        priesthood and succeeded his brother in the monastery, but the seventeenth\n                        king of Hor, Nor bu dbang rgyal, died prematurely, so he had to leave the\n                        monk body and succeed to the throne. As a confession (of having broken the\n                        monastic vows) a two-storey temple with six pillars was build in the\n                        monastery.
