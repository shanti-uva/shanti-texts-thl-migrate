They are said to have been created by the seventh century emperor Songtsen Gampo (\u003cem\u003esrong btsan sgam po\u003c/em\u003e) in order to divide his domain into manageable units. Originally there were four horns named largely after directions - Central Horn (\u003cem\u003edbus ru\u003c/em\u003e), Branch Horn (\u003cem\u003eru lag\u003c/em\u003e), Right Horn  (\u003cem\u003eg.yas ru\u003c/em\u003e), and Left Horn  (\u003cem\u003eg.yon ru\u003c/em\u003e). Later two more were added with names deriving from conquered ethnicities - Sumpa Horn (\u003cem\u003esum pa ru\u003c/em\u003e) and Zhang Zhung Horn (\u003cem\u003ezhang zhung ru\u003c/em\u003e).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the collapse of the Tibetan Empire the four horns of Tibet, which had formed the core units of the empire, lived on as a geographical designation that persists up to the present. As such, the \u0026ldquo;four horns of Tibet\u0026rdquo; can refer to central Tibet, and is sometimes used as a political term similar to \u0026ldquo;Tibet.\u0026rdquo;\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","source_url":null,"is_primary":true,"created_at":"2013-09-15 04:13:33 UTC","updated_at":"2013-09-15 04:13:33 UTC","authors":[{"id":"2","fullname":"David Germano"},{"id":"9","fullname":"Quentin Devers"},{"id":"15","fullname":"Brandon Dotson"}]}]}
