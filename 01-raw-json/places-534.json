In 1647, it came under the direct\n                     control of the Manchu government. In 1751, it came to be ruled by the Manchu\n                     officials resident in Tibet and in 1916, control was handed over to the Tibetan\n                     government. In 1959 sTeng chen rdzong was established and absorbed into Chab\n                     mdo region.

Around the 10th century, Shes rab\n                     rgyal mtshan, of the dMu khyung lineage, migrated to Sum pa glang.

The eldest was called lHa khyung, the second Thog la \u0026rsquo;bar and\n                        the youngest dMu khyung rgyal.

Of\n                        the six brothers, Khyung dbus Shes rab rgyal mtshan was guided by a prophecy\n                        as follows:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;The one who holds the lineage of dBra dkar Khyung po\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eMust go to mDo khams smad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eThe doctrine rises and falls like the sun and the moon,\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eEven if they fall tonight, they would shine tomorrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eAt the bottom of Sum glang lies rNgu rdzong,\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eIn front of the six magnificent fortresses of crystal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003esTeng chen is situated like the gold fish in a lake,\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eThere is the site for a seat of the Khyung family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eNow go towards that site.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eThe river of knowledge will wind there,\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eAnd the flag of the Khyung lineage will be stable there.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eWhen Khyung dbus arrived in sTeng chen there was a Chinese man there called\n                        gTsug gtor nyi ma \u0026rsquo;brug grags (hereafter, Nyi ma \u0026rsquo;brug grags). He was a man\n                        both powerful and learned. He realized that the time had come and that his\n                        was a suitable place to welcome Khyung dbus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eAt that time, Khyung dbus was travelling in the places called Khri, rDo, rMa\n                        and La.

He had turquoise hair and a white chin-tuft; he was dressed in\n                        white silk and was holding a lotus. He was found by the king of China, who\n                        called him Zing ba mthu chen. He became a prelate in the court and came to\n                        have the name Legs tang mang po. bSam gtan rgyal mtshan, one of his\n                        descendants, migrated to Tibet, where he subdued many gods and demons.
