There are also three private temples, in\n                     Jomsom, Nardzong and Dzar, but because they concern only individual families\n                     they are not considered here. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n                  \n\n                     \u003ch4 id=\"b7-1-1-1\"\u003e1.

This\n                        is probably because the community is populated by people who are ranked as\n                        Priests (bla mchod) in the social hierarchy of the area, between Nobles\n                        (dpon po) and Commoners (phal pa). \u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eThere are, however, a number of temples (variously called lha khang and dgon\n                        pa) that are either still functional or derelict and abandoned. The main\n                        temple (lha khang) is called Phun tshogs gling. It is a public institution,\n                        and it is here that almost all the community ceremonies are held. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eIn addition to Phun tshogs gling, there is another communal temple called\n                        sGom phug dgon pa, \u0026ldquo;the temple of the meditation cave\u0026rdquo;, situated uphill some\n                        twenty minutes\u0026rsquo; walk to the south of the main settlement area.

It appears to have been restored\n                        a number of times, but most recently, after its complete collapse, it was\n                        rebuilt with a grant from the Danish Embassy in Kathmandu.

Later he lived as\n                              a yogi in the mountains. During this period everyone said he had gone\n                              mad because he would sit for long periods staring into space. Once,\n                              while he was meditating, a beautiful young woman came to him and asked\n                              him if he was going to visit his teacher.

Born in 1957 of Tibetan parents\n                           just on the Indian side of the western Tibetan border, gYung drung rgyal\n                           mtshan was subsequently recognised as the incarnation of bsTan pa rgyal\n                           mtshan, who had been the founder of the little private Bonpo temple in\n                           nearby Jomsom (Mustang dialect Dzongsam \u0026lt; Tib rDzong gsar). gYung\n                           drung rgyal mtshan, the \u0026ldquo;Dzongsam sprul sku\u0026rdquo;, was educated to the level\n                           of dge bshes in sMan ri Monastery (No.231) in Dolanji, and after\n                           completing his studies came to settle in Klu brag in the early 1990s. He\n                           recently married a Klu brag woman and is living in sGom phug dgon pa (see\n                           below). \u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \n\n                     \n\n                        \u003ch5 id=\"b7-1-1-4-2\"\u003e4.2. The dbu mdzad\u003c/h5\u003e\n\n                        \u003cp\u003eFar from being considered a prestigious office, the position of dbu mdzad\n                           (precentor) is the most unpopular in the village. The incumbent is not\n                           decided on a rotational basis but is appointed at a village meeting held\n                           specifically for this purpose. The length of the term of office is on of\n                           the most variable, and although it is likely to be fixed at its present\n                           time of two years, terms of one and three years have been known in the\n                           past. The main reason for the unpopularity of the office is that the dbu\n                           mdzad may not go to India for trading during the winter, since his duties\n                           require him to be present in the village at least once a month. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n                        \u003cp\u003eThe dbu mdzad\u0026rsquo;s work consists in leading the chanting during ceremonies\n                           and, whatever his age (the criterion which determines the order of\n                           seating in non-religious gatherings) he sits at the head of the row of\n                           bla mas. He must make the gtor ma for all ceremonies in the temple with\n                           the aid of other village bla mas who are skilled at this, and during\n                           ceremonies lasting more than one day, he and the chos khrims pa (see\n                           below) must sleep inside the temple to guard the butter and flour\n                           sculptures from cats and rodents. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \n\n                     \n\n                        \u003ch5 id=\"b7-1-1-4-3\"\u003e4.3. The chos khrims pa\u003c/h5\u003e\n\n                        \u003cp\u003eThe chos khrims pa (proctor), who need not be literate, is chosen by\n                           appointment at the same time as the dbu mdzad. While the term of office\n                           is the same, the chos khrims pa is not obliged to forego the winter\n                           trading. Like many other aspects of monasticism, the duty of the proctor\n                           in Klu brag has been adapted to a lay environment, and its scope has been\n                           extended to include non-monastic functions. In spite of appearances the\n                           office is not merely a ceremonial vestige of earlier times, but it is\n                           apparently regarded as a valuable peacekeeping force. Evidence for this\n                           lies in the fact that at two of the annual secular festivals, an\n                           assistant chos khrims pa is appointed for the duration of the\n                           festivities. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \n\n                     \n\n                        \u003ch5 id=\"b7-1-1-4-4\"\u003e4.4. The jo mo bla ma\u003c/h5\u003e\n\n                        \u003cp\u003eIn theory, the duty of the jo mo bla ma (the \u0026ldquo;nuns\u0026rsquo; priest\u0026rdquo;) is to lead\n                           and supervise the nuns\u0026rsquo; ceremonies, whereas in actual fact is is only\n                           they who perform the chanting while the few nuns that there are now look\n                           on or administer and beer. There are two jo mo bla ma, of whom at least\n                           one must be literate. Whereas the term of office used to be three years,\n                           it has recently been reduced to two, and the incumbents are selected by\n                           casting dice amongst the adult male bla mas. In addition to the main\n                           annual ceremony of the nuns (see below), there is one that is conducted\n                           on the night of the tenth day in every month, and it is accordingly\n                           referred to as Tshes bcu mchod pa (tenth-day ceremony). \u003c/p\u003e\n\n                        \u003cp\u003eIn all the nuns\u0026rsquo; ceremonies, including the tshes bcu, making the gtor ma\n                           and the tshogs (consecrated food for subsequent distribution to all the\n                           villagers) is the duty of the younger jo mo bla ma, but he is usually\n                           helped by his senior. They are not obliged to forego the winter trading\n                           as is the dbu mdzad, but may be absent on the condition that they arrange\n                           for another bla ma to take their places. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n                        \u003cp\u003eOutgoing jo mo bla ma end their term of office after the annual ceremony,\n                           but their successors are decided before the ceremony. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \n\n                     \n\n                        \u003ch5 id=\"b7-1-1-4-5\"\u003e4.5.

Their term of\n                           office runs for only one year.

However, he is more integrated into the community to the extent\n                        that he has married into it and presides at rituals. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eThere are ten-and-a-half estates (grong pa) in Klu brag, and these are\n                        subdivided into fourteen households (khang pa).

There are many\n                        liturgical and a few biographical works kept either in the temple library or\n                        in private houses. Various other Bonpo works, published in India from other\n                        sources, have also been brought to the village. The inventory of these has\n                        not yet been completed. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n                  \n\n                  \n\n                     \u003ch4 id=\"b7-1-1-12\"\u003e12. Economic circumstances of temple\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eThe annual ceremonies performed in the village temple are financed by the\n                        priestly estates (grong pa) on the basis of capital that was invested in\n                        these rituals by patrons from Klu brag itself and from surrounding\n                        settlements. These investments and the interest that must be paid by each of\n                        the estates are recorded in a register of temple contributions referred to\n                        as the ma yig, the \u0026ldquo;record of capital\u0026rdquo;. The documents in question are in the\n                        form of sheets of coarse paper measuring 9.5 inches by 8.5 inches sewn\n                        together along the centre and folded horizontally to make a booklet. The two\n                        booklets are not, however, the original documents, but were copied from an\n                        earlier scroll by an educated bla ma from Mustang who lived in Klu brag for\n                        a short time at the request of the villagers. Households listed in the text\n                        are identified by the heads of each, and the names in the register refer to\n                        men who occupied this position in the last generation. The copies are\n                        therefore compratively recent, and the fact that they have been updated\n                        unfortunately makes it impossible to draw many inferences about the village\n                        as it would have been during the time of the document\u0026rsquo;s original\n                        composition. The type of patronage revealed by the register is not based on\n                        a private relationship between a bla ma and a lay householder, but embraces\n                        any number of people who wish to confer their patronage on the Klu brag\n                        temple and its community of bla mas. This system itself has two sightly\n                        varying forms. The first of these is apparently an earlier method and\n                        operates as follows. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eIf someone from a neighboring village loses a close relative, he or she may\n                        wish to bestow a certain amount of money on a religious institution in order\n                        that prayers be said and lamps lit to generate merit for the deceased. Such\n                        donations are known as sbyar mchog and are collected until the total is\n                        sufficient for the establishment of a ritual. Originally the money used to\n                        be divided up into eight equal portions and each portion given to one of the\n                        grong pa. This sum was used by that grong pa as capital (a ma) with which to\n                        trade, and interest to the value of ten per cent of the capital was\n                        contributed towards purchasing the foodstuffs necessary for the ceremony.\n                        Sometimes the sum given to each householder was not the same, and the form\n                        in which the interest was to be paid frequently differed, but these\n                        variations are all recorded in the register and must still be paid as they\n                        are entered.The names and perhaps the motives (usually the death of the\n                        named relative) were probably recorded in the original register, but the\n                        more recent booklets contain only details of the original contributions\n                        required of each household, and make provision for the new ninth grong pa.\n                        Rituals that are financed by this method are referred to as the \u0026lsquo;old\n                        ceremonies\u0026rsquo; (mchod pa rnying pa), and these are contained in the first of\n                        the two ma yig booklets. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eWhereas the recipients of the patronage used to be the grong pa, the money\n                        is now distributed among the \u0026lsquo;monks\u0026rsquo; (grwa pa) and nuns (jo mo). \u0026lsquo;Monks\u0026rsquo; in\n                        this case still refers to village bla mas and the money continues to be\n                        invested in household trade, but a household with two bla mas (for example,\n                        an extended household occupied by a father and his eldest son) or with a\n                        resident nun will be given a proportionately larger share of the capital.\n                        The system may be represented by a simple diagram. Let us suppose that at a\n                        certain point in time there are five priests or nuns in Klu brag\u0026rsquo;s religious\n                        community \\(in fact there are now fifteen), each represented in order of age\n                        by a letter. To simplify matters, it may be assumed that the sum of money\n                        collected as sbyar mchog is fifty rupees, and each person is consequently\n                        required to pay commodities to the value of one rupee per year as interest.\n                        The amount payable is represented by a number following each letter: \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n                     \u003ctable class=\"essay-table\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\"\u003e\u003ctr xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\"\u003e\n                           \u003ctd align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"\u003eA1\u003c/td\u003e\n                           \u003ctd align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"\u003eB1 \u003c/td\u003e\n                           \u003ctd align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"\u003eC1\u003c/td\u003e\n                           \u003ctd align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"\u003eD1\u003c/td\u003e\n                           \u003ctd align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"\u003eE1\u003c/td\u003e\n                        \u003c/tr\u003e\u003c/table\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eWhen a monk or a nun dies his or her payment of the interest ceases. But the\n                        terms of receiving sbyar mchog from patrons are that the ritual be\n                        perpetuated on as grand a scale as the capital permits, and the onus of the\n                        deceased\u0026rsquo;s temple contributions is transferred to the two youngest members\n                        of the community.

It may be that grong pa were\n                        fragmenting into separate households at that time, and since each house must\n                        have a resident bla ma, this was regarded as a fairer system. The theory\n                        would be that the combined wealth of the two households forming a split\n                        grong pa would be greater than that if the grong pa was still a unit.\n                        However, this is not necessarily the case, and it does not explain why nuns\n                        and junior bla mas in a house should have to pay, since they do not\n                        necessarily strengthen the economic situation of that house.
