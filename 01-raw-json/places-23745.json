The lower end of the valley rejoins the Nyakchu (\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\"\u003enyag chu\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e; \u003cem\u003e\u003cspan class=\"chinese\" title=\"Type ID here\"\u003eYalong Jiang\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e 雅砻江) River in Litang (\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\"\u003eli thang\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e). Traditional Nyarong maps onto all of contemporary Nyarong County, the northern part of Litang County, and some of Pelyül (\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\"\u003edpal yul\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e) County. Throughout much of its history Nyarong society has been divided into geographical sections, such as the upper, middle, and lower parts of the valley. Geoffrey Samuel says that socio-political organization in Nyarong was unusual for having a pronounced tribal structure, which is common in pastoral communities but much less so in places like Nyarong with a predominantly agricultural character. Nyarong’s period of greatest political and military strength was in the middle of the nineteenth century, when the valley was unified under the local chieftain Gönpo Namgyel (\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\"\u003emgon po rnam rgyal\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e, d. 1865). His violent unification of the entire Nyarong Valley in the 1840s angered the Qing overlords of Kham (\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\"\u003ekhams\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e) and they attacked him, together with assistance from many neighboring Kham polities. Gönpo Namgyel’s Nyarong successfully defended itself against the invaders. Emboldened, Gönpo Namgyel led his troops on many offensive campaigns against Litang, the Hor States, and Degé (\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\"\u003esde dge\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e). In 1862 the Nyarong forces completely occupied Degé, sending its royal family into exile. After the Qing troops were unable to vanquish him, the central Tibetan Ganden Palace’s (\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\"\u003edga’ ldan pho brang\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e) army joined the fight and killed Gönpo Namgyel in Nyarong. The Ganden Palace administered Nyarong from 1865 to 1896 via a post it created after the war called the Tibetan High Commissioner of Nyarong (\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\"\u003emdo smad nyag khog spyi khyab\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e).\u003c/p\u003e","source_url":null,"is_primary":false,"created_at":"2011-07-13 16:53:40 UTC","updated_at":"2011-07-13 16:53:40 UTC","authors":[{"id":"32","fullname":"Jann Ronis"},{"id":"32","fullname":"Jann Ronis"}]}]}
