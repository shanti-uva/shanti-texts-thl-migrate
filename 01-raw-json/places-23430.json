There were four monastic colleges and\n                        more than two thousand monks.

This was why Lung dkar\n                        Monastery considered Sog gYung drung gling to be its predecessor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eLung dkar Monastery\u0026rsquo;s history can be presented in three parts. First, in\n                        1715, Chos \u0026rsquo;bum, chief of the Hor Ye tha tribe, and his son Mu khri rgyal ba\n                        tshul khrims, who was a lama, founded the hermitage called Ri khrod dkar po\n                        in Lung bzang. The objective of this was to perform religious services for\n                        the lama and peace in the region. In that year bsKal bzang rgya mtsho, the\n                        Seventh Dalai Lama, passed through the Hor area from mGar thar in Khams on\n                        horseback. Chos \u0026rsquo;bum successfully solicited him to issue a decree officially\n                        recognizing the hermitage. But after the death of Mu khri rgyal ba tshul\n                        khrims, the hermitage collapsed due to internal discord.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eSecond, Ye tha Nor bu tshe rgyal, the scholar bSod nams lhun grub of dBu ri\n                        house and dBra Khyung rGyal ba bstan \u0026rsquo;dzin founded gYu lung Monastery in\n                        1808 at the same place. The king of Hor, Tshe ring rab brtan, issued a\n                        proclamation, with a preamble by rTa tshag Ho thog thu of Kun bde gling in\n                        Lhasa, that this monastery, which was an establishment for the leaders of\n                        the Ye tha community, should be lead by the lamas of sPo la and dBu ri. It\n                        actually became a real monastery from the time of dBu bla rGyal ba tshul\n                        khrims, the reincarnation of Mu khri, and it was called gYu lung. However,\n                        in 1868 it was destroyed by an avalanche of snow. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eThird, rNam rgyal dbang \u0026rsquo;dus, the king of Hor, then gave orders that the\n                        monastery should be restored at once, for it was an extremely bad omen that\n                        the monastery was destroyed by an avalanche and he gave twenty \u003cspan xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"\u003e\u0026rsquo;bri\u003c/span\u003e (young female yaks), along with a measure of\n                        Chinese silver, as a contribution to the restoration of the monastery. In\n                        1925, on the 22nd day of the 9th month, dBra khyung sKal bzang dbang grags\n                        and dBu ri bsTan \u0026rsquo;dzin dbang rgyal - supported by the local people and in\n                        accordance with a prophecy by gYung drung dbang rgyal, the Twentieth abbot\n                        of sMan ri - began to restore the monastery. On this occasion, important\n                        prelates of the Bon religion, such as Nyag gter gSang sngags gling pa, his\n                        wife mKha\u0026rsquo; \u0026rsquo;gro bDe chen dbang mo and Me ston Kun dga\u0026rsquo; rgyal mtshan all came\n                        and the monks of the monastery, joined by the local people, welcomed them\n                        with a procession.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eOn the same occasion, at the holy mountain called gSang brag nor bu lha rtse\n                        situated behind the monastery, the secret abode of the three wrathful\n                        deities blessed by the three holy ones, a profound text was rediscovered by\n                        gSang sngags gling pa and he, after tracing the path of circumambulation of\n                        the mountain, wrote a guide to it. There was a performance of the debate\n                        between gods and demons, in which the gods won and their sons went up to\n                        occupy the upper part of the Lung dkar valley and those of demons defeated\n                        went down to the lower part of the valley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eAround the holy mountain there are other mountains such as gYu lung, Lung\n                        dkar and dByi dkar with all their spirit proprietors.
