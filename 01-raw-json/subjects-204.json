However the practice of providing such creative etymologies is pervasive in Tibetan literature, and thus it is very important to document them. They contrast to \"basic syllabic etymology\" which is an attempt to provide a pragmatic account of the syllables meanings and their relationship to the term's overall meaning outside of any specific interpretative angle, \u0026nbsp;or \"historical etymology\", which focuses on a linguistic scholarly analysis of the word's linguistic roots.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","source_url":null,"is_primary":true,"created_at":"2013-09-15 04:03:48 UTC","updated_at":"2013-09-15 04:03:48 UTC","authors":[{"id":"2","fullname":"David Germano"}]}]}
