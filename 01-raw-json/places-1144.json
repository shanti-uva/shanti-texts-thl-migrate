Ancient Chinese\n                     Sources refer to The bo as Di Zhou (Di is the Chinese pronunciation of The,\n                     Zhou the Chinese word for prefecture), and state that it was established as a\n                     prefecture in 577 A.D. It is also mentioned that at the time, in addition to\n                     the present The bo county area, the prefecture included mDzo dge and Nan ping\n                     located in present day southern Gansu.

Later, with the development of\n                     Buddhism in the area, many Bonpo monasteries were converted to Buddhism,\n                     especially to the dGe lugs pa tradition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                  \u003cp\u003eThere are more than twenty Buddhist monasteries in The bo, all of which are dGe\n                     lugs pa with the exception of sPe gu Monastery which is Sa skya pa. The first\n                     Buddhist monastery in The bo appears to be sTeng ka Monastery, which was\n                     founded by dPal Shes rab \u0026rsquo;bar, a famous disciple of \u0026rsquo;Phags pa Blo gros rgyal\n                     mtshan (1235-1281), and which was later converted to the dGe lugs pa tradition.\n                     The dGe lugs pa began to establish monasteries in the area from the late\n                     sixteenth century onwards --three monasteries at the end of the sixteenth\n                     century, six in the seventeenth century, six in the eighteenth century, three\n                     in the nineteenth century, whose foundation date remains unknown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n               \n\n               \n\n                  \u003ch3 id=\"b6-1-3\"\u003e(91) gTso tshang Monastery\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n                  \n\n                     \u003ch4 id=\"b6-1-3-1\"\u003e1.

The site is located\n                        in Drongtsa (\u0026rsquo;Brong tsha) valley, 2 km east of the The bo county seat.

History\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eAccording to oral tradition, the three brothers and great Bonpo masters Do\n                        \u0026rsquo;phags chen mo, sKyang \u0026rsquo;phags Nyi ma rgyal mtshan and gTso \u0026rsquo;phags Zla ba\n                        rgyal mtshan came to Amdo to spread the Bon doctrine. They \u0026ldquo;opened\u0026rdquo; many\n                        hermitages (\u003cspan xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"\u003eri khrod\u003c/span\u003e), some of which later became\n                        monasteries (for instance, sNang zhig Monastery No. 180, one of the largest\n                        Bonpo monasteries in Tibet, was originally a hermitage founded by Do \u0026rsquo;phags\n                        chen mo). The three masters played a key role in the first spread of Bon in\n                        Amdo. There are descendents of gTso still living in The bo, Khri ka, Shar\n                        khog (=Zung chu) and rGan rgya in Amdo. Kyang za Yig rtsis ma, the mother of\n                        the three masters, also a fervent Bonpo, established her main residence at a\n                        site known as dGu skyang. gTso \u0026rsquo;phags Zla ba rgyal mtshan is believed to\n                        have travelled extensively throughout the area, actively spreading the Bon\n                        religion. Although he founded only a number of sacred sites (and no\n                        monastery), he made a profound impression on the local culture and\n                        traditions. One of his mother\u0026rsquo;s sacred sites and his main ritual and\n                        cremation sites are located at Chu gter rdzong, on Brag dkar bya rgod, a\n                        sacred mountain (\u003cspan xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"\u003egnas ri\u003c/span\u003e) in Amdo. The first Bonpo\n                        monasteries were founded much later (only four to five generations ago) by\n                        gTso \u0026rsquo;phags\u0026rsquo;s descendents. At present the remaining known descendents of\n                        gTso \u0026rsquo;phags live in the three villages that are financing the reconstruction\n                        of the three monasteries. Five of the families live in Ra nang village which\n                        is responsible for Ze kha Monastery, four in Bya brang village which is\n                        responsible for Bya brang Monastery, and two in gSer gzhong village which is\n                        responsible for gSer gzhong Monastery. There is no doubt that the \u0026rsquo;Phags pa\n                        rnams gsum were lay people and that their religious tradition was permeated\n                        by indigenous customs and beliefs.

Disappointed by the first\n                           two sites where he expected to receive some favourable omen, he continued\n                           his search. As he was passing through a place called Nags \u0026rsquo;bul beyond\n                           Tsha bzo mountain, he came upon a dead body which turned out to be that\n                           of the son of the A bze village chief who had been killed by a gang of\n                           robbers. He covered up the corpse, left his favourite dog behind to guard\n                           the corpse, and went to look for the deceased man\u0026rsquo;s father. He eventually\n                           met the chief and his entourage who were looking for the son. The chief,\n                           moved by the Lama\u0026rsquo;s solicitude for his dead son, requested him to become\n                           his spiritual master and offered him land on which to build the\n                           monastery, as well as fields and an estate to support it. The chosen site\n                           was known as Bya brang (\u0026ldquo;Bird\u0026rsquo;s chest\u0026rdquo;) because of its garuda-like shape.\n                           gSer so can accepted the offer and thus Bya brang Monastery was built.\n                           His successor and incarnation was born in Mar sgur village not far from\n                           the monastery.

The name is only known by its pronunciation and thus its\n                        exact meaning remains obscure. Shing skam in Tibetan, if spelt the way it is\n                        pronounced, literally means \u0026ldquo;dead tree\u0026rdquo;; this interpretation corresponds to\n                        one legend according to which the monastery was built on a site where many\n                        trees died.
