History\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eAccording to oral tradition, Su tshang Nam mkha\u0026rsquo; rgyal mtshan, (the Klu \u0026rsquo;bum\n                        dgon gyi lo rgyus, a MS has Nam mkha\u0026rsquo; rgya mtsho), the first master of the\n                        Su la lineage, founded a small monastery at Ka smad mgo called Su tshang\n                        about 10 km east of the present monastery. He is said to have been the\n                        spiritual master of \u0026rsquo;Bru dGa\u0026rsquo; bde chos skyong ber nag, one of the Thirty\n                        Heroes in the Ge sar epic. In Khams, the hero is considered as a historical\n                        figure. Nam mkha\u0026rsquo; rgyal mtshan was succeeded by his son Nam mkha\u0026rsquo; \u0026rsquo;od zer,\n                        who in turn was succeeded by his son Nam mkha\u0026rsquo; bstan \u0026rsquo;dzin, who in turn was\n                        succeeded by his son Nam mkha\u0026rsquo; tshul khrims. Since there was no water\n                        Sources in the vicinity, Nam mkha\u0026rsquo; tshul khrims undertook to channel water\n                        to the monastery, but the inhabitants of sGre bo village were unwilling to\n                        help. As a result the village split into two villages: sGre bo stod and sGre\n                        bo smad. Moreover, eight monks from sGre bo stod left the monastery and\n                        founded a small monastery called Su tshang stod pa. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eLater lCags mdud Shes rab rgyal mtshan, a master of the rNying ma pa\n                        monastery and located on the opposite bank of the rDza chu river, converted\n                        Su tshang stod pa to the rNying ma pa tradition and renamed it rNga rnga\n                        Monastery. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eAccording to KGLG, (volume 1, p.302) lCags mdud Shes rab rgyal mtshan only\n                        restored the monastery in 1491.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eSu tshang Nam mkha\u0026rsquo; tshul khrims and the people of sGre bo smad pa village\n                        founded Klu \u0026rsquo;bum Monastery. As they were preparing the site for\n                        construction, they discovered a Bonpo text entitled Klu \u0026rsquo;bum, and thus the\n                        monastery was named Klu \u0026rsquo;bum. Later Khod spungs Kun bzang \u0026rsquo;od gsal, the\n                        twenty-third master in the Su la lineage, enlarged the assembly hall. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eThe monastery mainly practised rituals according to the old gter ma (gter\n                        rnying) tradition, especially the ritual cycles of dBal gsas, Ge khod and\n                        sTag la, but after receiving the teachings based on the Rang gter sku gsum\n                        phur sgrub by gSang sngags gling pa the monastery also began to practise the\n                        new gter ma tradition (gter gsar). \u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eKhod spung mDo rgyud grags pa also lived and taught at the monastery for\n                        about five years. In 1923, gYung drung bstan \u0026rsquo;dzin, the 24th master in the\n                        Khod spung lineage, enlarged the monastery by building a new assembly hall\n                        with eight tall columns. The masters of the Khod spungs lineage, also known\n                        as Su la tshang, have been in charge of the monastery. It is not clear how\n                        many masters the lineage comprises but there are several names that\n                        frequently recur in both written and oral traditions. Su la sKal bzang bstan\n                        pa\u0026rsquo;i rgyal mtshan (1897-1959), who belonged to this lineage, wrote an\n                        extensive biography of Shar rdza bKra shis rgyal mtshan. The present master\n                        of Su la is bsKal bzang grags pa. Unfortunately I did not meet him when I\n                        visited the monastery in autumn 1997, because he was ill and was\n                        hospitalized in Chengdu at the time. I went with sMon rgyal lha sras to\n                        visit him in Chengdu, hoping to obtain more information about the monastery,\n                        but he was too ill to receive me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                  \n\n                  \n\n                     \u003ch4 id=\"b6-8-4-4\"\u003e4.

So there are exchanges\n                        between the two monasteries (see below).

The monasteries host the retreat in turn. From the 20th to\n                        the 30th day of the same month, they perform a ritual with \u0026rsquo;cham dance based\n                        on the sKu gsum phur sgrub, a gter ma text of gSang sngags gling pa as well\n                        as rituals of the cycle of gDugs dkar and the ceremony of the smyong gnas\n                        fasting.
