It was prosperous,\n                        with hundreds of monks and nuns. In spite of the extensive work devoted to\n                        the three noble deeds \u0026ldquo;keeping, defending and spreading the teachings of\n                        Eternal Bon\u0026rdquo; through generations of lamas, the monastery was upset by,\n                        needless to say, the troops of the Mongolian Jungar. During that time the\n                        Mongolians subjected the two Khyung po lamas, dBu se and dBu nag, to\n                        imprisonment and eventually murdered these two faultless lamas. The sight of\n                        this incident made their great many followers tremble and the lives of their\n                        followers subsequently fell into hopelessness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eThen a monastery called Khri dkar was set up on the bank of the Yag chu\n                        river and the teachings of Bon were spread by several generations of lamas.\n                        Destiny, however, reduced the monastery to a deteriorated state.

Until the age of\n                        twenty-five, he lived as a herdsman in the manner of a yogi in order to\n                        avoid being possessed by unclean transmigratory existence. At that time, his\n                        parents repeatedly murmured their hope that their son would succeed to the\n                        leadership of the family, but he did not accept this, for he wanted to take\n                        an oath to become a monk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eIn 1906, Nam mkha\u0026rsquo; rgyal mtshan was ordained in the presence of sMon rgyal\n                        Nam mkha\u0026rsquo; dbang rgyal in rDza khog.

Then a prophecy was made by\n                        the yogi A lo, and in accordance with it, in 1911 Nam mkha\u0026rsquo; rgyal mtshan\n                        went to seek the place where a new monastery should be built.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eIt was a place with many auspicious signs, such as the following: to the\n                        right, lHa ri spang mtho, whose summit consists of a crystal rock; at the\n                        front, Un chen dur krod nor bu spungs ri and gNyan chen wa ra, which look\n                        like dextral white conchs; and mountains, including, at the back, \u0026rsquo;Bul ri,\n                        the gathering place of deities, the \u003cspan xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"\u003eklu\u003c/span\u003e, and the \u003cspan xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"\u003egnyan\u003c/span\u003e.

Every sign of his achievement thrilled the\n                        common people. Since he had obtained omniscience and omnipotence, he came to\n                        be known everywhere as the one who would save all the people in this and the\n                        next life, by the designation of A bla sNang gsal, from Khyung lung dNgul\n                        mkhar in the west to mTsho sngon in Amdo in the east.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eAs for the account of his previous lives, his origin is traced back to Tshad\n                        med \u0026rsquo;od ldan in the time of gShen.

During his stay he\n                        fasted on the tenth day of every month, and made flower-offerings. Having\n                        seen this, some senior Bonpo took it as being most important for them and\n                        adopted it as a part of their collective works. The accomplished saint\n                        repeatedly shouted out an oath to the territorial deities such as Ri rgan\n                        Bum rdza se mo, and made them take vows so that they would protect the\n                        peaceful communities. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eLater, when the great abbot of sMan ri, Nyi ma bstan \u0026rsquo;dzin, came to rDza\n                        dmar, he not only urged and explained the necessity of building a monastery\n                        there, he also made the most careful preparations he could afford.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eThen another great abbot of mKhar sna (No.7), \u0026rsquo;Gro mgron Shes rab g-yung\n                        drung, came to rDza dmar and built a five-storey stupa at bKra shis na mo\n                        che.

For the sake of all beings, he spread\n                        the teachings of gShen widely, so that his fame reached every part of the\n                        Bonpo community.

Since there was no choice\n                        but for the monastery to be transferred to another place and rebuilt, the\n                        great abbot of sMan ri, Nyi ma dbang rgyal, and some others inspected Nor bu\n                        gdong, the plain below Ri rgan bum rdza. However, the officials, citizens\n                        and monks of rDza dmar all raised an objection to this with the reason that\n                        the place was too far from Ge mo where the lord Kham pa Ge khod resided,\n                        along with other reasons.

In order to tame the devil Bhyo ra nag po, he came down to a\n                        place called Yul bla ra na se with a turquoise drum booming in his hand.\n                        There he was known by the name of sGo rgyal lha bon thod dkar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eThe reason why he was known by the name of sKam is as follows: there was\n                        once a time when the lake Dwang ra g-yu mtsho overflowed naturally, and sGo\n                        rgyal lha bon thod dkar appeared and demonstrated his acquired ability by\n                        drying up the flood. After this, his clan came to be called by the name of\n                        sKam (which means drying).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eSubsequently, in some districts, including Dwang ra g-yu mtsho, sDe dge, and\n                        Hor sBra chen, men of the sKam family through successive generations became\n                        the most talented leaders. It is said that that there have been some 180\n                        masters in the sKam family, such as sGo A lod shig gzan, gYung drung nyi\n                        rgyal, the tutor of Nyi ma bstan \u0026rsquo;dzin, the great abbot of sMan ri; sKam\n                        Khro rgyal grags pa, Nyi ma rgyal mtshan, the abbot of So brgyad, and\n                        others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eThe way in which the sKam family formed the foundation of prosperity in the\n                        Hor sBra chen district was as follows: Once when a quarrel was provoked in\n                        the sDe dge district between sKam bsTan \u0026rsquo;dzin gtsug phud and Ga lhug, the\n                        chieftain of dKar shul, they asked the king of sDe dge at lHa thog to deal\n                        with it. sKam bsTan \u0026rsquo;dzin gtsug phud won the decision that the monastery\n                        should be exempt from taxation. Hearing this, the chieftain of dKar shul\n                        developed a hatred for him, and threatened that no monk would be allowed in\n                        the monastery. However, sKam bsTan \u0026rsquo;dzin gtsug phud felt generous enough to\n                        leave an excellent mark at the rTsi chu river as witness of his spiritual\n                        accomplishment. The Hor lineage eagerly wanted to leave for rTa sgo in upper\n                        Nag tshang. However at that time, Nyi ma rgyal mtshan, the elder son of the\n                        religious teacher of the Klu phug monastery in the Hor sBra chen district,\n                        repeatedly expressed his hope that he would fix his permanent abode in Hor\n                        sBra chen. Because of this, sKam bsTan \u0026rsquo;dzin gtsug phud took up permanent\n                        residence in the Hor sBra chen district so that he could give full support\n                        to the hope of Nyi ma rgyal mtshan. Descendants of sKam gradually increased\n                        and the teachings of gShen became widespread in rDza dmar in the sNye rong\n                        district.
