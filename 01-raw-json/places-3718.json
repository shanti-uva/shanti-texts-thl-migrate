That is why the monastery is called Klu phug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eThere was a Tantric establishment called mKhar dmar bla brang founded in\n                        1626 by Khri rgyal rje chen, the twelfth king of the Thirty-nine Tribes of\n                        Hor. He was a tantric practitioner and followed both Bon and \u0026rsquo;Bri gung bKa\u0026rsquo;\n                        rgyud pa traditions. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003emKhar dmar was situated at a saddle-shaped craggy red hill called Gung lhag.\n                        It was a two-storey building. On the top of the roof it had various emblems\n                        unique to the ancient Bon tradition, such as the perch of birds. In the\n                        centre and at the four corners of the roof there were spears erected and\n                        decorated with yak\u0026rsquo;s hair on their tips, surrounded by deer and wild yak\n                        horns. In the assembly hall on the upper floor there were four pillars and\n                        it was the place where twelve Tantric practitioners gathered together. There\n                        were the following religious objects: clay images of the four-armed sPyan\n                        ras gzigs, sGrol dkar, rNam par rgyal ba and Khri gtsug rgyal ba;\n                        scriptures, including the \u003cspan xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"\u003eKhams chen\u003c/span\u003e in sixteen\n                           volumes\u003cspan xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"\u003e \u003c/span\u003eand the \u003cspan xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"\u003ebDal \u0026rsquo;bum\u003c/span\u003e in\n                        twelve volumes; eight stupas made of a mixture of medicine and clay, each of\n                        which was as tall as an arrow. On the west side of the floor there was a\n                        single-pillared meditation room in which Khri rgyal rje chen erected\n                        gilt-bronze statues of Kun bzang rgyal ba \u0026rsquo;dus pa and dBal gsas rngam pa\n                        (this statue still exists) less than a cubit in height.

He came and stayed in Klu phug Monastery. There he\n                        presided over the ceremony of the enthronement of bsTan \u0026rsquo;dzin dbang grags,\n                        the reincarnation of lHa bla bsTan pa phun tshogs, at mKhar dmar bla brang.\n                        On the same occasion, he encouraged bsTan \u0026rsquo;dzin dbang grags and the twelve\n                        tantrists to take monastic ordination.

In his childhood, he was recognized as the\n                        reincarnation of a high lama in rGyal rong.

Following this,\n                        religious dances were performed, to which he added new dances: sNang bgyad,\n                        Tshogs \u0026rsquo;cham, and the Yamantaka.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003erNam rgyal dbang \u0026rsquo;dus, a brother of bsTan pa dar rgyas, entered the\n                        priesthood and succeeded his brother in the monastery, but the seventeenth\n                        king of Hor, Nor bu dbang rgyal, died prematurely, so he had to leave the\n                        monk body and succeed to the throne. As a confession (of having broken the\n                        monastic vows) a two-storey temple with six pillars was build in the\n                        monastery.

Intending to migrate to Western Tibet, they arrived at the\n                        residence of the rMa rong local chief. A rgya, the chief of rMa rong, was a\n                        patron of Kun bzang grags pa.
