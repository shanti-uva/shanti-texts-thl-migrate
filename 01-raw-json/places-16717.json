The array\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tapproximately measures 16 m (north-south) x 16.7 m (east-west). The west half of the array of pillars has been\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tobliterated. The east-west dimensions provided are between the most outlying row of pillars and the east wall\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the appended edifice. Originally, there were roughly 20 east-west oriented rows of pillars in the array.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThere are still around 130 standing stones, less than 15 percent of the original number. As intact lines of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpillars are spaced 30 cm to 50 cm apart (with wider spacings more common), it can be extrapolated that there\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twere no less than 1000 standing stones in the array. All of the brown sandstone pillars are highly eroded and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\textremely weathered. Most of the in situ pillars are tabular but there are also four-sided and irregularly\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tshaped specimens, especially among the smaller ones. The broad sides of the tabular pillars are oriented north\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand south. There are 26 larger pillars (40 cm and 60 cm high), which are mostly concentrated on the east side\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the array.

A northern fragment of this\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twall is 8.4 m long. This wall is composed of slabs 15 cm to 60 cm in length, which are only around 1 cm in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthickness. These slabs are flush with the ground surface or slightly project above it. There are also three\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\teast-west running double-course slab-wall fragments bordering and inside the pillar concourse. The parallel\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcourses of slabs are spaced 20 cm to 30 apart. These three double-course walls are highly fragmentary and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir original configuration and lengths could not be determined. The most intact of these wall fragments (3.3\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tm long) is found on the north side of the pillar array. The double-course wall fragment bordering the south\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tside of the pillar array is 2.9 m in length. On its west end there is a connecting double-course wall 90 cm in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlength that runs perpendicular. Little pieces of milky quartz in small amounts are scattered around the array\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof pillars.
