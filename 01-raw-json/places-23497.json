The site is located\n                        in Drongtsa (\u0026rsquo;Brong tsha) valley, 2 km east of the The bo county seat.

History\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eAccording to oral tradition, the three brothers and great Bonpo masters Do\n                        \u0026rsquo;phags chen mo, sKyang \u0026rsquo;phags Nyi ma rgyal mtshan and gTso \u0026rsquo;phags Zla ba\n                        rgyal mtshan came to Amdo to spread the Bon doctrine. They \u0026ldquo;opened\u0026rdquo; many\n                        hermitages (\u003cspan xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"\u003eri khrod\u003c/span\u003e), some of which later became\n                        monasteries (for instance, sNang zhig Monastery No. 180, one of the largest\n                        Bonpo monasteries in Tibet, was originally a hermitage founded by Do \u0026rsquo;phags\n                        chen mo). The three masters played a key role in the first spread of Bon in\n                        Amdo. There are descendents of gTso still living in The bo, Khri ka, Shar\n                        khog (=Zung chu) and rGan rgya in Amdo. Kyang za Yig rtsis ma, the mother of\n                        the three masters, also a fervent Bonpo, established her main residence at a\n                        site known as dGu skyang. gTso \u0026rsquo;phags Zla ba rgyal mtshan is believed to\n                        have travelled extensively throughout the area, actively spreading the Bon\n                        religion. Although he founded only a number of sacred sites (and no\n                        monastery), he made a profound impression on the local culture and\n                        traditions. One of his mother\u0026rsquo;s sacred sites and his main ritual and\n                        cremation sites are located at Chu gter rdzong, on Brag dkar bya rgod, a\n                        sacred mountain (\u003cspan xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"\u003egnas ri\u003c/span\u003e) in Amdo. The first Bonpo\n                        monasteries were founded much later (only four to five generations ago) by\n                        gTso \u0026rsquo;phags\u0026rsquo;s descendents. At present the remaining known descendents of\n                        gTso \u0026rsquo;phags live in the three villages that are financing the reconstruction\n                        of the three monasteries. Five of the families live in Ra nang village which\n                        is responsible for Ze kha Monastery, four in Bya brang village which is\n                        responsible for Bya brang Monastery, and two in gSer gzhong village which is\n                        responsible for gSer gzhong Monastery. There is no doubt that the \u0026rsquo;Phags pa\n                        rnams gsum were lay people and that their religious tradition was permeated\n                        by indigenous customs and beliefs. However, the monasteries - which emerged\n                        much later - seem to have been strongly influenced by Buddhism.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eSince gTso tshang Monastery in fact comprises three monasteries - Ze kha,\n                        Bya brang, and gSer gzhong - it is important to mention here the information\n                        concerning their respective historical backgrounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \n\n                        \u003ch5 id=\"b6-1-3-3-1\"\u003e\n                           \u003cspan xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"\u003eZe kha\u003c/span\u003e\n                        \u003c/h5\u003e\n\n                        \u003cp\u003eThe date of Ze kha Monastery\u0026rsquo;s foundation and the identity of its founder\n                           remain obscure; even A skal, the only surviving monk who has some\n                           knowledge on the history of gTso tshang and who wrote the only historical\n                           account of the monastery (\u003cspan xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"\u003eTGLG\u003c/span\u003e) is uncertain. The\n                           first master of Ze kha Monastery, Shar ba khri skyang, was born in sTod\n                           mtsho \u0026rsquo;phel into one of the three Khri skyang villages of Zung chu County\n                           in rNga ba Prefecture; the second master was born in rGya myi ya ru (the\n                           exact location of which remains unknown).

During his lifetime the monastery\u0026rsquo;s assembly hall was\n                           destroyed by fire and rebuilt. He travelled to Central Tibet and Khams.\n                           He was renowned as a saint, and was believed to be endowed with\n                           miraculous powers (\u003cspan xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"\u003egrub rtags\u003c/span\u003e); He is said to have\n                           founded the monastery\u0026rsquo;s \u003cspan xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"\u003e\u0026rsquo;cham\u003c/span\u003e (monastic dance).

The fifth, Bla ma skyabs, was born in\n                           lDong ba village of Brag sgom ba; his father was called A dam and his\n                           mother Klu mo. He broke his religious vows, so three influential monks of\n                           Ze kha - Dran pa skyabs, bSod nams dar rgyas and A rdo - invited Tshul\n                           khrims rgyal mtshan, a descendent of Do \u0026rsquo;phags chen po, then aged five,\n                           from rNga khog to take his place in 1930. However, the new incumbent also\n                           broke his vows when he turned twenty-five, and was replaced by his\n                           brother Bon slebs Nam mkha\u0026rsquo; bstan \u0026rsquo;dzin, the present master of gTso\n                           tshang Monastery.

Disappointed by the first\n                           two sites where he expected to receive some favourable omen, he continued\n                           his search. As he was passing through a place called Nags \u0026rsquo;bul beyond\n                           Tsha bzo mountain, he came upon a dead body which turned out to be that\n                           of the son of the A bze village chief who had been killed by a gang of\n                           robbers. He covered up the corpse, left his favourite dog behind to guard\n                           the corpse, and went to look for the deceased man\u0026rsquo;s father. He eventually\n                           met the chief and his entourage who were looking for the son. The chief,\n                           moved by the Lama\u0026rsquo;s solicitude for his dead son, requested him to become\n                           his spiritual master and offered him land on which to build the\n                           monastery, as well as fields and an estate to support it. The chosen site\n                           was known as Bya brang (\u0026ldquo;Bird\u0026rsquo;s chest\u0026rdquo;) because of its garuda-like shape.\n                           gSer so can accepted the offer and thus Bya brang Monastery was built.\n                           His successor and incarnation was born in Mar sgur village not far from\n                           the monastery. Not much is known about the third incarnation except that\n                           he too was born in Mar sgur. However there are many fantastical tales\n                           relating his miraculous deeds circulating among the local Bonpo\n                           community.
