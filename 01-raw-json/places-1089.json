The Bonpo scholar and historian Shar rdza bKra shis rgyal\n                        mtshan (1858-1934) also mentions this personage in his historical work.\u003ca href=\"#n13\" name=\"nb13\" class=\"note\"\u003e13\u003c/a\u003e It is also said that Me nyag sTag gsas and rMa lHa rgod of Nyag rong\n                        are in fact one and the same. There is a prayer text entitled Lo rgyus gsol\n                        \u0026rsquo;debs (MS) in Ye shes Monastery mentioning that \u0026ldquo;the great and powerful hero\n                        Me nyag sTag gsas came to Me nyag under the name of rMa gsas lHa rgod\u0026rdquo;.\u003ca href=\"#n14\" name=\"nb14\" class=\"note\"\u003e14\u003c/a\u003e\n                     \u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eThe son of rMa lHa rgod was called Nam mkha\u0026rsquo; ye shes.

He won the esteem and support of Klu rgyal, the chief of Nyag rong\n                        who helped him build a monastery at Brag dmar mdo rtsa in his honour. The\n                        monastery was named Ye shes Monastery after him. Since the monastery\n                        consisted of temples (lha khang), the place became known as Lha khang thang,\n                        the \u0026ldquo;plain of temples\u0026rdquo;.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eThree generations of Nyag rong chiefs acted as patrons of Nam mkha\u0026rsquo; ye shes:\n                        Klu rgyal, his son Klu mgon and his grandson Klu skyabs.\u003ca href=\"#n15\" name=\"nb15\" class=\"note\"\u003e15\u003c/a\u003e Nam mkha\u0026rsquo; ye shes was succeeded by Cang mkhar spo sByin pa rgyal\n                           mtshan\u003ca href=\"#n16\" name=\"nb16\" class=\"note\"\u003e16\u003c/a\u003e who spent the first half of his life in Ye shes Monastery, and then\n                        left the monastery to live in a hermitage which he founded on a hill called\n                        Dar ri, which is why he is also locally known as Dar ri sByin pa rgyal\n                        mtshan.

In his youth, he was recognized\n                        as the reincarnation of a master called Dri med \u0026rsquo;od zer, and the abbot of\n                        the monastery,Tshul khrims mchog rgyal, kept him in the monastery.

It was hidden away during the turbulent history. As it\n                        turned out, it was the only complete extant copy of the Bonpo Canon. Its\n                        publication, owing to the strenuous efforts of A yung and his friend Shug\n                        sdong sKal bzang phun tshogs, represents a major contribution to Tibetan\n                        cultural heritage, although the published version is not an exact replica of\n                        the dBal khyung manuscript.

According to one short account of the monastery\u0026rsquo;s\n                        history (rGyal zhing dgon gyi lo rgyus, 8 folios, MS and anonymous), it was\n                        founded by the master Bya btang Nam mkha\u0026rsquo; rgyal mtshan in the 10th Rab byung\n                        (1567-1626), and later, because there was no Sources of drinking water in\n                        the vicinity, Khyung \u0026rsquo;khor sMon lam tshul khrims, the master at that time,\n                        moved the monastery to a new place. The new monastery had nine columns and\n                        was named rGyal ba bkra shis.

While the monastery\n                        was being built, the people heard a dragon in the sky and thus the monastery\n                        was named rGyal zhing \u0026rsquo;brug grags.

No one knows when it was built or why it was abandoned. In the 13th\n                        Rab byung (1747-1806), another small monastery was built by gSang sngags\n                        gling pa.

He donated these objects to Gong rgyal Monastery. Around that\n                        time the monastery had about one hundred monks.

However, when I visited the monastery in 1997,\n                        I was told that the reincarnation system was adopted after Bya btang gYung\n                        drung rgyal mtshan\u0026rsquo;s time. So far, because of the lack of reliable Sources\n                        it has been impossible to verify either versions of the story.

He is said to have been the\n                        spiritual master of \u0026rsquo;Bru dGa\u0026rsquo; bde chos skyong ber nag, one of the Thirty\n                        Heroes in the Ge sar epic. In Khams, the hero is considered as a historical\n                        figure. Nam mkha\u0026rsquo; rgyal mtshan was succeeded by his son Nam mkha\u0026rsquo; \u0026rsquo;od zer,\n                        who in turn was succeeded by his son Nam mkha\u0026rsquo; bstan \u0026rsquo;dzin, who in turn was\n                        succeeded by his son Nam mkha\u0026rsquo; tshul khrims. Since there was no water\n                        Sources in the vicinity, Nam mkha\u0026rsquo; tshul khrims undertook to channel water\n                        to the monastery, but the inhabitants of sGre bo village were unwilling to\n                        help. As a result the village split into two villages: sGre bo stod and sGre\n                        bo smad. Moreover, eight monks from sGre bo stod left the monastery and\n                        founded a small monastery called Su tshang stod pa. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eLater lCags mdud Shes rab rgyal mtshan, a master of the rNying ma pa\n                        monastery and located on the opposite bank of the rDza chu river, converted\n                        Su tshang stod pa to the rNying ma pa tradition and renamed it rNga rnga\n                        Monastery. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eAccording to KGLG, (volume 1, p.302) lCags mdud Shes rab rgyal mtshan only\n                        restored the monastery in 1491.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eSu tshang Nam mkha\u0026rsquo; tshul khrims and the people of sGre bo smad pa village\n                        founded Klu \u0026rsquo;bum Monastery. As they were preparing the site for\n                        construction, they discovered a Bonpo text entitled Klu \u0026rsquo;bum, and thus the\n                        monastery was named Klu \u0026rsquo;bum. Later Khod spungs Kun bzang \u0026rsquo;od gsal, the\n                        twenty-third master in the Su la lineage, enlarged the assembly hall. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eThe monastery mainly practised rituals according to the old gter ma (gter\n                        rnying) tradition, especially the ritual cycles of dBal gsas, Ge khod and\n                        sTag la, but after receiving the teachings based on the Rang gter sku gsum\n                        phur sgrub by gSang sngags gling pa the monastery also began to practise the\n                        new gter ma tradition (gter gsar). \u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eKhod spung mDo rgyud grags pa also lived and taught at the monastery for\n                        about five years. In 1923, gYung drung bstan \u0026rsquo;dzin, the 24th master in the\n                        Khod spung lineage, enlarged the monastery by building a new assembly hall\n                        with eight tall columns. The masters of the Khod spungs lineage, also known\n                        as Su la tshang, have been in charge of the monastery. It is not clear how\n                        many masters the lineage comprises but there are several names that\n                        frequently recur in both written and oral traditions.
