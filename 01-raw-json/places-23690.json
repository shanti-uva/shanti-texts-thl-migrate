In 1776 the Qing pacified Chuchen, where the Qing established the Independent Sub-prefecture (that is, Zhili Ting) of A-er-gu. In 1779 A-er-gu Sub-prefecture was eliminated, and the area was incorporated into Meinuo Sub-prefecture, which was under the jurisdiction of Chengmian Longmao Circuit (成绵龙茂道). In 1783 Meinuo Sub-prefecture became Maogong Sub-prefecture in Charge of the Affairs of the Agricultural Garrisons (Military Agricultural Colonies), and Suijing Colony (绥靖屯) and Chonghua Colony (崇化屯) were established in Chuchen. In addition, Suijing (绥靖营), Chonghua (崇化营), and Qingning Battalions (庆宁营) were also stationed there to rule over the region.\u003c/p\u003e","source_url":null,"is_primary":false,"created_at":"2011-07-13 16:55:31 UTC","updated_at":"2011-07-13 16:55:31 UTC","authors":[{"id":"52","fullname":"Yudru Tsomu"},{"id":"52","fullname":"Yudru Tsomu"}]}]}
