{"descriptions":[{"id":1038,"title":"An Overview of Tibetan Political Periods","content":"\u003cp\u003eThe Tibetan people originated in the seventh and eighth century with the rise of a powerful empire on the Tibetan plateau, which over three centuries fostered a common language, writing system, history, and identity amongst a large group of peoples who formerly had chiefly adhered to local identities and regional affiliations. Thus our first political period \u0026ndash; Empire \u0026ndash; is also the time of the birth of the Tibetans as a people and community stretching across the huge geographical extent of the Tibetan plateau.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the gradual disintegration of the empire in the ninth century, the Tibetan plateau and its people were never to again have such overarching political unity. However, the cultural unity fashioned in the cauldron of the Empire was to persist in the form of Tibetan Buddhism and B\u0026ouml;n religions, the common literary medium of classical Tibetan, the linked set of spoken languages, and a sense of shared ancestry and destiny as reflected in literature, art, religion, and identity. Politically, however, there are four subsequent very broad periods, each\u0026nbsp;marked by a great diversity of concurrent  political formations ranging from a family governing a single valley all the way to regional polities holding some type of authority over a large area. Thus the present scheme of five Tibetan political periods involves naming broad periods after a dominant political structure that holds sway for a lengthy time. The focus is on Central Tibetan areas, since this is historically the political heart of the Tibetan people due to it being the site of the origins of the empire which gave birth to Tibet as an identity, and because the most important centralized political structures over history were usually located there.\u003c/p\u003e","source_url":null,"is_primary":true,"created_at":"2013-09-15 04:10:33 UTC","updated_at":"2013-09-15 04:10:33 UTC","authors":[{"id":"2","fullname":"David Germano"}]}]}
