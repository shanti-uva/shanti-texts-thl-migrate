This is often labeled a \u0026ldquo;colophon,\u0026rdquo; but we have chosen to separate it out as a \u0026ldquo;closing section\u0026rdquo; since it is distinct from the following sections and at times contains considerably more information than merely the title. For Tengyur texts this often includes a statement indicating who wrote the text. Example: སུམ་ཅུ་པའི་ཚིག་ལེའུར་བྱས་པ་སློབ་དཔོན་ཆེན་པོ་དབྱིག་གཉིེན་གྱིས་མཛད་པ་རྫོགས་སོ།། Note: the closing section will often include data about who wrote the text. This is not an author's colophon unless it says something like \"I, so-and-so, wrote this at such-and-such place, at such-and-such time, at the request of so-and-so\" etc. The presence of any such parts of the statement identify the section as an author's colophon. \u003ca href=\"http://www.thlib.org/tools/#wiki=/access/wiki/site/c06fa8cf-c49c-4ebc-007f-482de5382105/more%20issues%20related%20to%20closing%20sections.html\"\u003eMore Issues Related to Closing Sections\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e","source_url":null,"is_primary":true,"created_at":"2013-09-15 04:14:18 UTC","updated_at":"2013-09-15 04:14:18 UTC","authors":[{"id":"3","fullname":"Steve Weinberger"}]}]}
