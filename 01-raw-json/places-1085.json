The next morning, the\n                        statue had become a perfect representation of gShen rab Mi bo. It was named\n                        sTon pa Rang grub, the \u0026ldquo;self-manifesting master\u0026rdquo; and the monastery was named\n                        after it. The statue is believed to have survived until the mid-20th\n                        century.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eAlthough there is a list of masters which \u0026rsquo;Phrin dga\u0026rsquo; claims represents the\n                        lineage of the monastery\u0026rsquo;s masters, it is obvious that there are several\n                        names in the list that have nothing to do with the monastery\u0026rsquo;s history so I\n                        did not find it necessary to include it here. The monastery was rebuilt and\n                        resumed its religious activities in the 1980s.
