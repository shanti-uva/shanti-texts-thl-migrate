Its dimensions\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tare as follows: 11 m (southeast wall), 12 m (southwest wall), 13.4 m (northwest wall), and 7.4 m (northeast\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twall). It consists of two wings of rooms set behind an east-facing courtyard. The courtyard is 6.8 m long on\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tits north side and 4.3 m long on its south side. The walls enclosing the courtyard are double-coursed, around\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t50 cm thick and a maximum of 1.5 m high. The entrance to the courtyard is in the east. \u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cp\u003eThe north wing of the building consists of a row of four rooms: northeast, central east, central west, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twest. The northeast room (exterior dimensions: 2.7 m x 3 m, interior dimensions: 2 m x 2.2 m, floor-to-ceiling\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\theight: 1.7 m) still has a fully intact roof, complete with a smoke hole. Stone slabs are piled up around the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsmoke hole and could have been manipulated to regulate the draft. The entrance (90 cm x 60 cm) to the 2-m high\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnortheast room is in the south. There are three small niches in the west wall and one niche in the east wall\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the room. There are traces of the mud plaster that originally covered the interior walls. Corbels project\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tabout 20 cm from all four walls. There are two corbels on all but the west wall, which only has one. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdiagonally-oriented bridging stones are up to 1.2 m in length. On the south side of the roof there is a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tparapet wall that extends about 20 cm above the rest of the northeast room. The fact that the northeast room\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tis the only fully intact structure at rdo rta sga as well as the crude, incongruous\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconstruction of the upper courses of stonework and arrested corbelling technique used, indicates that the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnortheast room was rebuilt at some point in time, probably by religious practitioners. \u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cp\u003eThe south side of the central east room (1.7 m x 80 cm) has largely collapsed. Its south entrance was about\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t80 cm in height. Against the north wall there is a structural extension (1.6 m x 1.4 m) with a small entrance\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tor opening. This sheltered space must have had a storage or specialized ritual function. The west central room\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(2.4 m x 1.8 m) is now largely filled with earth. Although its entrance (approximately 80 cm high) has been\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlargely destroyed, the 1.3-m long overarching lintel is still in situ. There is a niche in the west wall. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twest/rear room (3.2 m x 2 m) of the north wing of RS2 was accessed via the central west room. The entranceway\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbetween them is 60 cm wide. Above the fully underground rear wall of the west rear room there are the remains\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof a parapet, adding 30 cm to its height. Some corbels still rest on top of the walls in the central west and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twest rear rooms. The floor-to-ceiling height of the west room is 1.6 m. There are three large subterranean\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trecesses in the rear wall of the west room, which must have had a special religious function (perhaps related\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto the worship of chthonic spirits). These three recesses are elevated 10 cm to 30 cm above the floor of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twest room. The north recess measures 50 cm x 70 cm x 70 cm.
