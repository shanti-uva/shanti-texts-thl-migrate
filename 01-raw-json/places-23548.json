Location\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eIt is located on a hill behind Hyo pa district administrative seat, 97 km\n                        from Derge, the county seat. Hyo pa means \u0026ldquo;below\u0026rdquo; in the local Tibetan\n                        dialect. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n                  \n\n                  \n\n                     \u003ch4 id=\"b6-5-8-3\"\u003e3. History\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eThere is little information concerning the history of the monastery. The\n                        monks in Ri spun Monastery indicated that their monastery was associated\n                        with rDzong gsar, a Sa skya pa monastery in the same county, and that I\n                        would probably find some information concerning Ri spun in the historical\n                        records of rDzong gsar Monastery. I found only one account of rDzong gsar\u0026rsquo;s\n                        history, entitled rDzong gsar dgon gyi lo gyus (MS, anonymous), but the name\n                        of Ri spun is not even mentioned there. Yet several people, including\n                        Buddhists and government officials, also confirmed the connection between Ri\n                        spun and rDzong gsar. Indeed the monasteries maintain very close ties and\n                        rDzong gsar, being the wealthier of the two, even supports Ri spun\n                        Monastery. However, rDzong gsar does not acknowledge its Bon related origin,\n                        not even in its historical records. The local inhabitants say that there is\n                        a stone tablet with an inscription concerning the history of Ri spun and\n                        rDzong gsar in the place from lHa tshe dbang of dPal spungs thang on the\n                        shore of gSer ngu g.yu mtsho lake with an inscription concerning the history\n                        of Ri spun and rDzong gsar, but Blo gros phun tshogs, the author of Ri spun\n                        dgon gyi lo rgyus, says that he could not find it. There are ruins of an\n                        ancient castle at the top of a hill near the monastery called Khyung po\n                        rdzong, and there are several rather vague legends concerning its history,\n                        but no one seems to know anything precise about it. According to oral\n                        tradition, the monastery was founded in a Fire-Hare Year, but in which Rab\n                        byung remains unknown. It is said that several famous masters, such as Shar\n                        pa rNal \u0026rsquo;byor, Khyung po Blo gros rgyal mtshan, Bu \u0026rsquo;bor Tog gi rgyal mtshan,\n                        Du tshe rTogs ldan and Ri bla Ye shes stayed at the monastery. In the latter\n                        half of Ri bla Ye shes\u0026rsquo;s life, the monastery was destroyed in a local\n                        conflict and that it was rebuilt by Ri bla Dar rgyas. Unfortunately, the\n                        dates of the masters mentioned above remain unknown. The monastery was\n                        destroyed during the Cultural Revolution and in 1983 permission was granted\n                        for its reconstruction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                  \n\n                  \n\n                     \u003ch4 id=\"b6-5-8-4\"\u003e4.

There is a white rock on the mountain east of the monastery\n                        which is associated with a deity called Tis \u0026rsquo;dra, but there is no fixed date\n                        for its propitiation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eThere is a sacred mountain called Phur pa lha khang 5 km east of the\n                        monastery, which was a sacred site venerated annually by both monastic and\n                        lay communities until about the middle of the 20th century. Other local\n                        sacred sites include the ruins of three castles: mKhar nag, 7 km southeast\n                        of the monastery, lHa rgod, 50 m north of the monastery, and gNas nang, 10\n                        km northeast of the monastery; the local inhabitants claim that a person who\n                        has contracted the bad kan disease may be cured if he circumabulates all\n                        three sites within one day. gNas nang was the residence of Bu \u0026rsquo;bor Tog gi\n                        rgyal mtshan, and there are still one hundred and twenty-two Bon po families\n                        living in the area.
