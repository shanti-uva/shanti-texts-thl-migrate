{"descriptions":[{"id":1140,"title":"An Overview of the Caplan Collection","content":"\u003cp\u003eThe Caplan Collection consists of photographs taken by Lionel and Pat Caplan in Nepal during the 1960s, and later in the 1980s, as part of their academic research in Nepal. Please consult the descriptions of the two sub-collections for details on the cultural, historical, and ethnographic background of these fascinating photographs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe photos of East Nepal (Ilam district) were taken during Lionel Caplan's field trip in 1964-65 and his re-visit to the area in 1988. He worked in a cluster of settlements (the 'Indreni settlements') which were part of Barbote Village panchayat, north of the district capital Ilam Bazaar. The focus of his study was on 'Hindu-tribal' relations as these were expressed in a confrontation over land.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe photos of West Nepal (Dailekh district) were taken in 1969. Lionel Caplan did fieldwork in Dailekh Bazaar, and concentrated on the historical ties between this district capital and its hinterland. Pat Caplan's fieldwork was situated in Bhurti village, a few miles north of the Bazaar, and her study examined the changing relations between high castes and 'untouchables'.\u003c/p\u003e","source_url":null,"is_primary":true,"created_at":"2013-09-15 04:13:37 UTC","updated_at":"2013-09-15 04:13:37 UTC","authors":[{"id":"16","fullname":"Lionel Caplan"}]}]}
