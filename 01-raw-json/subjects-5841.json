{"descriptions":[{"id":1611,"title":"An Overview of Sleep and Dream Yogas","content":"\u003cp\u003eSleep and dream yogas are closely related to the esoteric meditations upon light, and exoteric contemplations on emptiness and illusion. Falling asleep involves the intertwined dissolution of winds, conceptuality, and consciousness similar to dying, and likewise culminating in an experience of radiant light and deep unconsciousness; dreaming involves the reversal of this process as manifestation, conceptuality, and experience revive out of the emptiness of radiant light. The goal is to preserve reflexive self-awareness throughout so as to bypass unconsciousness and instead fully experience the ultimate radiant light of consciousness. One visualizes an inner luminosity or syllable representing one\u0026rsquo;s consciousness moving up and down the central axis of the body\u0026rsquo;s interior, until finally with sleep it settles into a lotus flower at the heart. The practice facilitates lucid dreaming, namely the retention of a sense of awareness that one is dreaming even as one dreams. Such awareness\u0026mdash;and the consequent sense of the malleability and fluidity of appearances\u0026mdash;precisely parallels the Great Vehicle contemplation of emptiness and its focus on the illusory nature of appearances. Specific dreaming practices tend to be grouped into three principles\u0026mdash;recognizing dreams as dreams, experimenting with the transformation of dream appearances, and enabling this awareness of recognized dreams to permeate daytime experience as well.\u003c/p\u003e","source_url":null,"is_primary":true,"created_at":"2013-09-15 04:17:50 UTC","updated_at":"2013-09-15 04:17:50 UTC","authors":[{"id":"2","fullname":"David Germano"}]}]}
