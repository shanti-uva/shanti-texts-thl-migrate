{"descriptions":[{"id":302,"title":"An Overview of the Ngorpa Sakya Tradition","content":"\u003cp\u003eThe Sakya tradition remained more or less unitary until 1429, when the monastery of Ngor Evam Ch\u0026ouml;den (ngor e bam chos ldan) was founded by the great Sakya scholar Ngorchen K\u0026uuml;nga Zangpo (kun dga' bzang po, 1382-1444) in Tsang (gtsang) not far from Zhikats\u0026eacute; (gzhis ka rtse). From this point on, Ngor emerged as a distinctive sub-sect with many monasteries considering themselves affiliated with Ngor rather than Sakya proper. This includes the famous Deg\u0026eacute; G\u0026ouml;nchen Lh\u0026uuml;ndrup Teng (sde dge dgon chen lhun grub steng [?]) and its associated printery. Indeed, Ngor eventually emerged as the dynamic center of the Sakya tradition.
