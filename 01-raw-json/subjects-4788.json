{"descriptions":[{"id":1164,"title":null,"content":"\u003cp class=\"Paragraph\"\u003eIn classical Tibetan many verbs have up to four different root forms. Spoken Tibetan makes indiscriminate use of verb stem forms that correspond to the \u0026ldquo;future\u0026rdquo; and the \u0026ldquo;present\u0026rdquo; in Literary Tibetan, and at the most only distinguishes between two tenses: the \u003cstrong\u003epast\u003c/strong\u003e and the \u003cstrong\u003epresent-future\u003c/strong\u003e. While some verbs also have a distinctive imperative stem, in most cases this stem resembles either the present-future or the past. Very often, the verb is quite simply \u003cstrong\u003einvariable\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"Paragraph\"\u003eThe large number of invariable verbs means that inflection is practically redundant in the spoken language. Tenses are formed by using a system of auxiliaries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"Paragraph\"\u003eFor more information, see the entry on verb inflection in the appendices to this Reference Grammar.\u003c/p\u003e","source_url":null,"is_primary":true,"created_at":"2013-09-15 04:14:02 UTC","updated_at":"2013-09-15 04:14:02 UTC","authors":[{"id":"6","fullname":"Nicolas Tournadre"}]}]}
