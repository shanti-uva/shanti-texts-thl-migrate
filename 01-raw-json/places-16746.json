A\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tright angle bend in the west wall demonstrates that FS2 did not have a simple rectangular plan. The top of FS2\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tundulates, due to the effects of erosion.

These structures occupy a 65-m long swathe of terrain that rises to the west at a moderate angle. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thighly degraded square structures of the west sector generally measure 2 m x 2 m, and are built of brown\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsandstone slabs and blocks (10 cm to 30 cm in length). Integral walls have been reduced to 15 cm to 35 cm in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\theight and, together with the rubble lying on top of them, these structures attain a maximum height of 50 cm.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThey were skillfully built masonry constructions, which may have reached a height that would have given them a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcubic form. One specimen has a rubble-filled depression in the middle of the base, suggesting that these\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstructures possessed central chambers. These chambers most plausibly served as reliquaries or ossuaries. \u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cp\u003eThe morphological affinities that the west sector structures share with the mountaintop cubic tombs are\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tself-evident.

If so, each of the various architectural components of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsite and their spatial relationships to one another were constituent parts of a cultural narrative and ritual\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tregimen. \u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cp\u003eThe 13 structures of the west sector are aggregated in five groups plus one isolated specimen.
