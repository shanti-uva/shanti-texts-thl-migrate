The thousand-household districts were administered by larger administrative units called \"horns\" (\u003cem\u003eru\u003c/em\u003e). Originally all horns didn't have the same number of thousand-household districts, but in 744 a territorial reorganisation balanced the disparities between horns. This is why the affiliation of some of the thousand-household districts changed horn-affiliation in 744.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe name is derived from it being a district supposed to provide a regiment of one thousand soldiers, or alternatively, that it is a district of one thousand households. Either way, each household was supposed to provide one solidier for the imperial army.\u003c/p\u003e","source_url":null,"is_primary":true,"created_at":"2013-09-15 04:13:30 UTC","updated_at":"2013-09-15 04:13:30 UTC","authors":[{"id":"15","fullname":"Brandon Dotson"}]}]}
