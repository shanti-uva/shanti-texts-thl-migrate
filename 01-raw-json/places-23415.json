He was born in\n                        1703 in the sDe dge district of Khams. From childhood, he had innate\n                        knowledge and intelligence of remarkable lucidity. He devoted himself to the\n                        practice of meritorious deeds. He had love and compassion for all religious\n                        trainees. In the manifestation of right discernment that he displayed he was\n                        quite unlike any other child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eWhen he reached the appropriate age, he received the most careful\n                        initiations and transmissions of Sutra and Tantra in the presence of the\n                        great abbot of sMan ri, gYung drung tshul khrims. Having done this, he made\n                        rapid progress in practising meditation. He circumambulated the holy\n                        mountains in Amdo and Central Tibet, regardless of the schools they belonged\n                        to. At the same time, he studied under many excellent masters of several\n                        monasteries. Since he respected them as his chief masters and received\n                        profound initiations, text-transmissions and religious teachings, he reached\n                        a state worthy of praise from everyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eThen he went to see lHo rTogs ldan dkar po, whose name was widely known.

Then he went northward,\n                        close to the yak hair tent of the chieftain of the Sog community, and asked\n                        for alms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eThere were three brothers in the chieftain\u0026rsquo;s family: the elder, middle and\n                        younger, whose names were, respectively, Khro bo rgyal, Khro bo dar and Khro\n                        bo srung. At that time, Khro bo rgyal, the elder one, had been suffering\n                        from an illness for a year, during which all medical care and religious\n                        rituals had no effect at all. The three brothers invited the saint lHun grup\n                        dbang ldan into their tent, and the elder one, Khro bo rgyal, said,\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Happiness is welling up inside me at the very sight of you,\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eFlowing through my body is energy that I have never felt before,\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eI would like to remember what name you bear,\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eI prostrate myself with reverence,\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eI wonder what caused me to suffer from illness,\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eI beg from you the best divinatory service to turn my illness away.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003elHun grup dbang ldan said in reply: \u0026ldquo;I am the one called lHun grup dbang\n                        ldan, but I am not the one who tells whether the divination comes out good\n                        or bad. What I can do for you is to give you medical treatment.\u0026rdquo; Then he\n                        made an examination of urine and faeces, and gave the most careful medical\n                        treatment to satisfy the elder brother\u0026rsquo;s wishes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eForty-nine days later the patient finally got far better than their\n                        expectation, which, at the same time, raised faith and reverence in the\n                        brothers\u0026rsquo; minds. Though they repeatedly asked him what kind of thing he\n                        wanted as a doctor\u0026rsquo;s fee, he said \u0026ldquo;I do not need any kind of doctor\u0026rsquo;s fee,\n                        but I have a wish to build a monastery in accordance with the prophecy made\n                        previously by the superior saint. Therefore I shall request you to give me a\n                        small piece of land where a monastery could be built. The three brothers\n                        were so happy to hear his words that they said, \u0026ldquo;We shall do as you tell\n                        us.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eThen the saint lHun grup dbang ldan, accompanied by the three brothers, went\n                        on to examine all the area under their jurisdiction within the Sog district,\n                        and encamped for a night at a place called Pha bong thang, where they saw\n                        many auspicious manifestations that night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eTherefore, in 1797, a decision was made to establish a monastery on this\n                        distinctive land. The future monastery was given a good name, the Glorious\n                        Nor bu gling, and an elaborate purification ritual was performed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eWith regard to the surroundings of this square piece of land, they appear to\n                        be very good, described as follows: to the east is the protective mountain\n                        rGya stag khro bo, a white rocky mountain with the appearance of a haughty\n                        tiger that is thirsty, to the north is the protective Rus sbal ser po, a\n                        meadowy hill shining like a hero\u0026rsquo;s helmet, to the west is the protective Bya\n                        dmar mtshal lu, a beautiful scarlet hill of slate mingled with verdigris, to\n                        the south is the protective gYu \u0026rsquo;brug sngon po, a blue rocky mountain\n                        sticking high into the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eAll the lamas, leaders, patrons and priests were summoned, and worked\n                        without being lazy or negligent. Because of this, they managed to build the\n                        assembly hall of the monastery within the very year of the decision being\n                        taken. Not only that, by mutual agreement among the assembled monks of the\n                        Three Trainings, they increased the number of monks from four to six, then\n                        gradually from six to thirteen. In the early days, when there were only four\n                        monks, they were called \u0026ldquo;the four young qualified ones\u0026rdquo; (mTshan ldan khye\u0026rsquo;u\n                        bzhi), when six, \u0026ldquo;the six gShen who guide the beings\u0026rdquo; (\u0026rsquo;Dul ba gShen drug),\n                        and when increased to thirteen, they came to be known everywhere as \u0026ldquo;the\n                        thirteen gShen\u0026rdquo; (Ye gshen bcu gsum). From that time, the Bon doors of outer,\n                        inner and secret were opened and the great tradition of the teachings of\n                        chanting services and meditation came to be established, especially the \u003cspan xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"\u003erNam rgyal\u003c/span\u003e and \u003cspan xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"\u003egYung drung klong\n                           rgyas\u003c/span\u003e which were performed according to the tradition established by\n                        the former adepts.
