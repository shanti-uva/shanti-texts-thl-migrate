In the \"Historical buildings in Lhasa\" table at the back of the book (pp. 165-172), buildings of the \"Tenement or Residential yard\" type are designated with the letter \"I\" in the building type column. In the THL Place Dictionary, when a building has this feature type and the\u003cem\u003e Lhasa Atlas\u003c/em\u003e is given as the source, it means that the building was designated with a \"I\" in the \u003cem\u003eLhasa Atlas\u003c/em\u003e table.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThis building type is described as follows:\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\"\u003cem\u003eI.

Originally, it was privately owned by rich monasteries or the government, and built to generate rental income as well as to provide much needed housing. Unlike most other buildings, the residential yard is normally asymmetrical, built to fit the given site configuration. It is often an assembly of small, terraced and uniform two- or three-stroey townhouses. A common courtyard provides access to a well and latrines\" (p. 61).\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eSource:\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eLarsen, Knud and Amund Sinding-Larsen. \u003cem\u003eThe Lhasa Atlas: Traditional Tibetan Architecture and Townscape\u003c/em\u003e.
