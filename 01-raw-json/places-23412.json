During that time the\n                        Mongolians subjected the two Khyung po lamas, dBu se and dBu nag, to\n                        imprisonment and eventually murdered these two faultless lamas. The sight of\n                        this incident made their great many followers tremble and the lives of their\n                        followers subsequently fell into hopelessness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eThen a monastery called Khri dkar was set up on the bank of the Yag chu\n                        river and the teachings of Bon were spread by several generations of lamas.\n                        Destiny, however, reduced the monastery to a deteriorated state.

At that time, his\n                        parents repeatedly murmured their hope that their son would succeed to the\n                        leadership of the family, but he did not accept this, for he wanted to take\n                        an oath to become a monk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eIn 1906, Nam mkha\u0026rsquo; rgyal mtshan was ordained in the presence of sMon rgyal\n                        Nam mkha\u0026rsquo; dbang rgyal in rDza khog.

Then a prophecy was made by\n                        the yogi A lo, and in accordance with it, in 1911 Nam mkha\u0026rsquo; rgyal mtshan\n                        went to seek the place where a new monastery should be built.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eIt was a place with many auspicious signs, such as the following: to the\n                        right, lHa ri spang mtho, whose summit consists of a crystal rock; at the\n                        front, Un chen dur krod nor bu spungs ri and gNyan chen wa ra, which look\n                        like dextral white conchs; and mountains, including, at the back, \u0026rsquo;Bul ri,\n                        the gathering place of deities, the \u003cspan xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"\u003eklu\u003c/span\u003e, and the \u003cspan xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"\u003egnyan\u003c/span\u003e.
