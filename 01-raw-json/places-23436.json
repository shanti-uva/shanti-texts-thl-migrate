It is also\n                        known as Nang mdun dgon. sPu rgyal is a holy mountain for both Bonpo and\n                        Buddhists. Its being a holy site was prophesied by early sages and this is\n                        particularly clear in the guide written by gTer ston bDe chen gling pa. rMa\n                        rong Monastery was later enlarged by Drung mu, who had overcome many\n                        obstacles brought on by the local deities.

Intending to migrate to Western Tibet, they arrived at the\n                        residence of the rMa rong local chief. A rgya, the chief of rMa rong, was a\n                        patron of Kun bzang grags pa. A rgya and his people requested Kun bzang\n                        grags pa to be the head of rMa rong Monastery. However, Kun bzang grags pa\n                        and his brother declined the offer. They continued their journey. A rgya\n                        then informed Khri rgyal rje chen, the twelfth king of Hor. The king told\n                        Kun bzang grags pa that not only could he not leave for Western Tibet, he\n                        should settle down in the pastureland where the king had his herd of \u003cspan xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"\u003emdzo\u003c/span\u003e animals, as well as look after rMa rong Monastery.\n                        From that point the monastery had to perform religious services for the\n                        benefit of the king and, in return, the king issued an edict in recognition\n                        of the monastery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eKhyung po gYung drung rnam dag, the son of Khyung po Kun bzang grags pa, had\n                        a temple called rNam rgyal lha khang built in the monastery, containing many\n                        religious objects. He made majestic masks of the religious protectors such\n                        as the Ma (Srid pa rgyal mo), the bDud (Mi bdu \u0026rsquo;byams pa khrag mgo) and the\n                        bTsan (Brag btsan A bse rgyal ba). The mask of the bTsan is regarded as\n                        special since no dust ever stays on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eOf the three sons of gYung drung rnam dag, the eldest, Nam mkha\u0026rsquo; rgyal po,\n                        made many copies of scriptures for the monastery.

Nyi ma \u0026rsquo;jig rten is said to have been chivalrous.\n                        His son was Khyung po g-yung dpal. When Khyung po g-yung dpal died, it is\n                        said that where his corpse was buried the tree \u003cspan xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"\u003estag ma\u003c/span\u003e\n                        grew from his tongue. His son was gYung drung phun tshogs, whose sons were\n                        Blo ldan grags pa and Tshe dbang grags pa. Tshe dbang grags pa brought\n                        considerable development to the monastery. After that, Blo ldan grags pa was\n                        involved in a dispute with bSod nams bkra shis, the brother of the rMa rong\n                        chief, so Blo ldan grags pa strongly wished to leave for Western Tibet, but\n                        was prevented by the king of Hor. The king told him that unless he would\n                        live in rMa rong he would have to live in either Khrom tshang or sGong ru.\n                        So Blo ldan grags pa stayed in Khrom tshang for several years, during which\n                        rMa rong Monastery declined a little. After that, bSod nams dbang \u0026rsquo;dus, the\n                        son of the rMa rong chief, requested the lama to come back to the monastery,\n                        but the lama was unwilling. Through the mediation of a representative of the\n                        king and the Be hu of the Sog tribe, the lama was reinstalled as the head of\n                        the monastery. He undertook as much restoration as he could. He lived to one\n                        hundred years of age. His son is Khyung po Bla rgan gYung dga\u0026rsquo;, who is\n                        presently at the monastery. There were nine lamas in the line of succession,\n                        from Kun bzang grags pa to Blo ldan grags pa. The king of Hor recognized a\n                        number of them by issuing offical letters to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                     \u003cp\u003eThe monastery\u0026rsquo;s main religious objects, all of which were of great\n                        sublimity, were as follows: a large white conch whose sound travelled very\n                        far, rediscovered by gTer ston gYung drung grags pa of Zhu; the horn of a\n                        female deer, which was the private property of Khyung A sha ba rang grol;\n                        the reliquary stupa of Khyung po Nang chen grags pa, called gSer \u0026rsquo;od \u0026rsquo;bar ba\n                        or rTen bya \u0026rsquo;phur ma; and a statue of Dzam bha lha made of A ya sbug ge,\n                        rediscovered in dKyis \u0026rsquo;khor thang in rTa shod by rTa shod Bu mo pad ma\n                        mtsho.
