In total, there were at least 60 rooms constructed here. Most walls in the southwest\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcomplex are made from adobe blocks and attain a maximum elevation of 4 m. Some of these adobe walls have course\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof cobbles integrated into them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cp\u003eAccess to the southwest complex is by way of a small hole that was cut into the north face of the summit.

Inside the southwest complex the north side of the formation has cobble wall fragments\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twith intervening courses of sandstone slabs, up to 3 m in height, embedded in it. Certain walls also have\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsandstone-slab bases. Some structures were hewn into the top of the summit along the south side of the complex\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto create a semi-subterranean network of rooms. They are, however, in very poor condition.

In some places their roofs have collapsed, leaving\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgaping holes in the summit. The largest cave in the north of the complex (3.3 m x 3 m) has a 1.6-m deep bay in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe rear wall. In the right wall there is a niche (1 m x 1.3 m) partly enclosed by a masonry wall. Also on the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tright wall of this cave there is a mud and stone closet (1 m x 55 cm x 1 m) with two openings in its base. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfunction of these appointments is not readily apparent. The largest cave in the north of the complex is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconnected to the summit by a 2.8-m long passageway. The exterior entrance of this passageway has an in situ\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstone lintel and sill. The ceiling of the passageway is lined with stones, which in design is not unlike that of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tan all-stone corbelled roof. Moreover, parts of its two walls are lined in cobble masonry. On the right side of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe passageway there is a 1-m deep recess below the floor level. In a nearby cave (4.4 m x 3.3 m) there are two\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1.6-m deep bays cut into the rear wall. Beside the bays there is a mud-plastered masonry wall creating an\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tenclosed space (1 m x 90 cm x 70 cm).\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cp\u003eThere is an axial corridor along the south portion of the summit.

Another constructional feature of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsouthwest complex is walls made of cobbles and sandstone slabs embedded into a light-colored clay and mud\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmatrix.

The remains of a series of steps cut into this tunnel ascend for about 10 m\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto the south side of the northeast complex. Near the top of the tunnel are three interconnected cave rooms.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThese caves have the characteristic arched recesses and oblong niches, as well as a natural band of red clay\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\taround the base of the walls.

The large rammed-earth structure on the crown\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the summit (6 m x 6 m) has wall segments that probably reach 8 m in height.
