This limestone bulwark in the <span class=\"popular\">Arong</span><span class=\"scholar\">A rong</span> valley rises some 400 m above the east side of the <span class=\"popular\">Tri Tso</span><span class=\"scholar\">Khri tsho</span> basin. The high quality pasturage and plentiful water of the <span class=\"popular\">Tri Tso</span><span class=\"scholar\">Khri tsho</span> basin and the adjoining larger basin of <span class=\"popular\">Pangar Zhung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dpa&rsquo; ngar gzhung</span> (in the <span class=\"popular\">Senge Tsangpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sengge gtsang po</span> flood plain) have been magnets of settlement since early times. Other archaic strongholds in the proximity are <span class=\"popular\">Sharo M&ouml;on Dur</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sha ro mon dur</span> (A-32) and <span class=\"popular\">Pangar Zhung Khargok</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dpa&rsquo; ngar gzhung mkhar gog</span> (A-31). The awny-colored formation of <span class=\"popular\">A Rong M&ouml;n Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">A rong mon mkhar</span> is very precipitous and inherently defensible. It has commanding views to the north in the direction of the big basins. This site probably served as a refuge from attack and the final line of defense for he locality. Its inhabitants must have faced a very fierce enemy to have built such a high and isolated safehold. It is only accessible via the southeast branch of the <span class=\"popular\">Arong</span><span class=\"scholar\">A rong</span> valley via a steep and narrow slope. There are no signs of permanent dwellings at <span class=\"popular\">A Rong M&ouml;n Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">A rong mon mkhar</span>. The dry-mortar random-work ramparts were constructed using uncut hunks of limestone. They form a highly developed symmetrical defensive array on the summit. It is unclear how the inhabitants of <span class=\"popular\">A Rong M&ouml;n Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">A rong mon mkhar</span> obtained drinking water. Presently, there is no water in the <span class=\"popular\">Arong</span><span class=\"scholar\">A rong</span> valley (except when there is snow melt or possibly during a heavy bout of summer rains). </p> <h4 id=\"b1-1-90-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>According to local residents, <span class=\"popular\">A Rong M&ouml;n Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">A rong mon mkhar</span> was an ancient <span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span> facility.</p> <h4 id=\"b1-1-90-4\">Site elements</h4> <h5 id=\"b1-1-90-4-1\">Upper summit</h5> <p>The low end (4820 m) of <span class=\"popular\">A Rong M&ouml;n Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">A rong mon mkhar</span> is comprised of a breastwork that protected this constricted approach (only 3.5 m wide) to he stronghold. Only two fragments of the wall built at this strategic juncture have survived (2.9 m long and 1.3 m high, 9.6 m long and 1.1 m high). This was the forward line of defense for <span class=\"popular\">A Rong M&ouml;n Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">A rong mon mkhar</span>. Above the breastwork the slopes rise to a saddle (4840 m) with a precipitous drop on its southwest side. The top end of this saddle connects to a narrow rib of rock with the vestiges of a defensive wall and steps that lead up to the summit. This fortified access route inclined at 45&deg; is 21 m in length and reaches the southeast edge of the summit installation. The base of what appears to have been a breastwork (3.8 m x 3.8 m) straddles the top at this spot. Although it is up to 2.5 m in height (on its forward or southeast flank), no freestanding walls are left in this structure. This guarding gateway to the summit, the tallest structure remaining at <span class=\"popular\">A Rong M&ouml;n Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">A rong mon mkhar</span>, is likely to have been a significant defensive feature. It accesses the upper summit, which is up to 15 m wide. The remains of a parapet wall line the northeast edge of he upper summit. With a long vertical rock face below, no such wall was necessary along the part of the summit overlooking the southwest branch of the <span class=\"popular\">Arong</span><span class=\"scholar\">A rong</span> valley. </p> <h5 id=\"b1-1-90-4-2\">Lower summit</h5> <p>The upper summit admits to the lower summit, a zone 55 m in length and a maximum of 30 in width. The lower summit along its north-south axis is oriented at a 30&deg; angle. There are traces of a parapet wall on the rim of he lower summit overlooking the southeast branch of the <span class=\"popular\">Arong</span><span class=\"scholar\">A rong</span> valley. On account of large vertical expanses of rock, a parapet wall was not needed on the side of the summit that soars above the southwest branch of the <span class=\"popular\">Arong</span><span class=\"scholar\">A rong</span> valley. The lower summit is dominated by two parallel series of ramparts. There appear to be seven ramparts in each series built at graded elevations. Each of these walls is between 4 m and 11 m in length and are 80 cm to 1 m high on their forward or downhill side. Some of the ramparts form platforms up o 2 m in width, which could have been used for domestic functions (by erecting temporary shelters of some kind). Conceivably, bowmen could fire in unison from behind these walls, unleashing a curtain of arrows. Perhaps his wall network was also used for ritual purposes. </p> <table cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\" class=\"navarrows\"> <tbody> <tr> <td class=\"leftcell\"> <a class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-left.gif\" title=\"Previous Section\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"midcell\"> <a class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-up.gif\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"rightcell\"> <a class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-right.gif\" title=\"Next Section\"/> </a> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div id=\"chap-id\">/bellezza/b1-1-90/</div> <div style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\" class=\"jqmWindow\" id=\"chapRefWindow\"> <div class=\"closebtn\"> <a href=\"#\">Close</a> </div> <div style=\"height: 280px;\" class=\"conx-content\"> <h3>Note Citation for Page <span class=\"pgnm\"/> </h3> <p class=\"biblref\">John Vincent Bellezza, Antiquities of Zhang Zhung: A Comprehensive Inventory of Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Monuments on he Tibetan Upland (Charlottesville, VA 22904:Tibetan &amp; Himalayan Library, 2010), <span class=\"pgnm\"/>. </p> <h3>Bibliographic Citation</h3> <p>John Vincent Bellezza.
