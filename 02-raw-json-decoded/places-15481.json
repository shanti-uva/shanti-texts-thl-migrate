Yuan rule was largely administered by the <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15481\">Sakya</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"F15481\">sa skya</span></em>) polity, and thus this period in Tibetan history is often referred to as the Yuan-Sakya period.</p> <p>The Mongol leader Genghis Khan (ruled 1206-1227) first met with Tibetan Buddhist figures as early as 1215, most likely in the Tangut kingdom. This meeting led to no lasting interaction, and it was not until 1240 that Goden, son of Ogedai Khan (ruled 1229-1241), sent troops into Tibetan territories as far as <span class=\"place\" title=\"F7945\">Peny&uuml;l</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"F7945\">'phan yul</span></em>), to the northeast of <span class=\"place\" title=\"F637\">Lhasa</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"F637\">lha sa</span></em>). For reasons not fully understood, <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Sakya Pandita</span> (<span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">sa skya paN+Di ta</span>), abbot of <span class=\"place\" title=\"F17088\">Sakya</span> Monastery to the far southwest, acted as a representative for Tibetan territories in negotiations with Goden's military commander, Dorta. Dorta was apparently impressed with the <span class=\"place\" title=\"F17088\">Sakya</span> hierarch, so much so that, when word got back to the Khan of the meeting, Goden ordered <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Sakya Pandita</span> to meet in Liangjou. Goden did not meet with <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Sakya Pandita</span> until 1247, the year in which the century-long relationship between the Mongol empire and the <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15481\">Sakya</span> polity began.</p> <p>The first direct control by Mongol imperial families came in 1251 (the year, by the way, of <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Sakya Pandita</span>'s death),when Mongke Khan (ruled 1251-1259) distributed appanages consisting of Tibetan territories to major Mongol leaders. Mongke himself took <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15482\">Drikung</span> (<span class=\"place\" title=\"F15482\">'bri gung</span>), Goden Khan took <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15481\">Sakya</span>, Qubilai Khan received <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Ts&eacute;</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">tsel</span></em>), <span class=\"place\" title=\"F11614\">Taklung</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"F11614\">stag lung</span></em>) was under Arig Boge, and <span class=\"place\" title=\"F11608\">Phakmodru</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"F11608\">phag mo gru</span></em>) &nbsp;fell under Hulegu's jurisdiction. Ruling from sometimes great distances, the Mongols could exert direct administrative and military control over their regions, though we possess insufficient evidence to describe the details of their rule during this period with any degree of specificity. It is apparent that the military incursions into Tibetan territory during this period were enough to strike lasting fear of the Mongols into the Tibetan leadership for generations to come.</p> <p>It was Mongke's successor, Qubilai Khan (ruled 1260-1294) that cemented the relationship between the <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15481\">Sakya</span> polity and the Mongol empire. Qubilai formed a relationship with <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Sakya Pandita</span>'s nephew, <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pakpa Lodr&ouml; Gyeltsen</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">'phags pa blo gros rgyal mtshan</span></em>, 1235-1280) in 1254, giving him an edict granting <span class=\"place\" title=\"F17088\">Sakya Monastery</span> tax-exempt status under Mongol rule, but not, at has sometimes been suggested, granting the <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15481\">Sakya</span> polity control over Tibet. This was to come some years later, when in 1261 Qubilai granted <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pakpa</span> the title of National Preceptor (guoshi), and in 1264 issued another edict of tax-exemption while at the same time stationing adminstrators from <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15481\">Sakya</span> at the head of each of the three regions or <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ch&ouml;lkha s&uuml;m</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">chol kha gsum</span></em>) of Tibet under Mongol control. With his new title <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pakpa</span> returned to <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15481\">Sakya</span> in 1263 to take up the post of abbot of <span class=\"place\" title=\"F17088\">Sakya Monastery</span> (he had served as abbot in absentia since the death of his uncle in 1251, and held the position until his death in 1280), and to begin to refashion the regional administration into a national administrative control center. The day-to-day administration was left to the newly founded office of <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">p&ouml;nchen</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">dpon chen</span></em>), which <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pakpa</span> created in 1265. Beginning with <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Shakya Zangpo</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">shƒÅkya bzang po</span></em>), the <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">p&ouml;nchen</span> were to play a critical role in the politics of Tibet for the next century.</p> <h2><strong>The Yuan-Sakya Regime</strong></h2> <p>The various Tibetan leaders in central Tibet did not all willingly accept the increasing control over their territories by the Yuan-Sakya regime, and through the 1280s minor revolts were not uncommon. In 1281 Qubilai Khan was forced to send 7000 Mongol troops under the control of the Tibetanized Uighur Sanko to quell dissent after <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pakpa</span>'s death in 1280, an action that resulted in the establishment of the first permanent Mongol military garrison in Tibet.</p> <p>In the late thirteenth century several changes in Yuan administrative structures altered the relationship between the imperial court and Tibet. First, due to his success in the 1280 military campaigns in central Tibet, Sanko rose in the Yuan hierarchy to become head of a new entity, the Department of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs. The Department was the principal unit of the imperial administration, and was in charge of all imperial military ventures in Tibet. It determined Tibetan affairs through the early fourteenth century, even though Sanko fell into disgrace after a decade of service, and was finally executed in 1291. Secondly, on the religious side, Pakpa was granted a new imperial title in 1270 when he became the first Imperial Preceptor (dishi), meaning that until his death in 1280 he was both abbot of Sakya Monastery and a major figure at the Yuan court, even if the Imperial Preceptor did not directly manage Tibetan affairs.</p> <p>Finally, a new administrative office was created within Tibet in the late 1260s, known as the Pacification Office. Its purpose was to execute the orders of the Department of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs and oversee the activities of the P&ouml;nchen and his local Tibetan administration at Sakya. The jurisdiction of the Pacification Office was limited to the western Tibetan region of <span class=\"place\" title=\"F3862\">Ngari</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"F3862\">mnga' ris</span></em>) as well as <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15355\">&Uuml;</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"F15355\">dbus</span></em>) and <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15354\">Tsang</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"F15354\">gtsang</span></em>) &nbsp;until 1290, with the <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">p&ouml;nchen</span> Aglen made a successful military venture in the southern Tibetan regions of <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15352\">Kongpo</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"F15352\">kong po</span></em>) and <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15351\">Dakpo</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"F15351\">dwags po</span></em>) and brought them under Yuan-Sakya control. The <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">p&ouml;nchen</span> remained perhaps the most powerful single individual in Tibet from this period until the mid-fourteenth century, for he was simultaneously the leader of the now thriving <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15481\">Sakya</span> polity and, under the authority vested in him by the Pacification Office and the Department of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs, the leader of the central Tibetan government, including all territory from far western Tibet to the southeastern region of <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15352\">Kongpo</span>.</p> <h2><strong>Tibetan Territorial Divisions under Mongol Rule</strong></h2> <p>Under Mongol rule Tibetan territory was, at least on paper if not always on the ground, divided into administrative units known as myriarchies &nbsp;or <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">trikor</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">khri skor</span></em>). The traditional number of myriarchies in central Tibet is thirteen, though individual lists of the territories vary somewhat throughout the period. The date of the Mongol implementation of the myriarchy system in Tibet is not known, though it was likely in force by 1268, the year of the Imperial census of central Tibet. The origins of the Tibetan myriarchies are unclear, though it appears that most were formed out of existing territories and regional polities. Leaders of these new territories, the myriarchs or <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">trip&ouml;n</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">khri dpon</span></em>) were appointed by the Imperial Preceptor, as was <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Jangchup Gyeltsen</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">byang chub rgyal mtshan</span></em>) appointed&nbsp;leader of the <span class=\"place\" title=\"F11608\">Pakmodru</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"F11608\">phag mo gru</span></em>) myriarchy&nbsp;in 1322. A standard list of thirteen myriarchies includes the three regions of <span class=\"place\" title=\"F3862\">Ngari</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">mnga' ris skor gsum</span></em>): 1) <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Gug&eacute;</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">gu ge</span></em>); 2) <span class=\"place\" title=\"F3873\">Pureng</span>&nbsp;(<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"F3873\">pu rang</span></em>); 3) <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15383\">Mangy&uuml;l</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"F15383\">mang yul</span></em>); 4) <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Lat&ouml; Jang</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">la stod byang</span></em>); 5) <span class=\"place\" title=\"F11601\">Chumik</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"F11601\">chu mig</span></em>); 6) <span class=\"place\" title=\"F11602\">Zhalu</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"F11602\">zha lu</span></em>); six in central Tibet: 7) <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15482\">Drikung</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"F15482\">'bri gung</span></em>); 8) <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Ts&eacute;l</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">tshal</span></em>); 9) <span class=\"place\" title=\"F11608\">Pakmodru</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"F11608\">phag mo gru</span></em>); 10) <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Yapzang</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">g.ya' bzang</span></em>); 11) <span class=\"place\" title=\"F437\">Gyama</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"F437\">rgya ma</span></em>); 12) <span class=\"place\" title=\"F11614\">Taklung</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"F11614\">stag lung</span></em>); and one on the border of <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15355\">&Uuml;</span> and <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15354\">Tsang</span>: 13) <span class=\"place\" title=\"F7870\">Yamdrok</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"F7870\">ya 'brog</span></em>).</p> <p>Save for <span class=\"place\" title=\"F11608\">Pakmodru</span>, which is dealt with in another essay, little is known of the administrative features of the myriarchies. It is known that the census of Tibetan territories was organized according to the myriarchies. The Mongol leaders routinely conducted a census in newly aquired territories, and Tibet was no exception. In 1268 Tibetan officials carried out a census in three groups, one for <span class=\"place\" title=\"F3862\">Ngari</span> and <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15354\">Tsang</span> and one for <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15355\">&Uuml;</span>. The basic unit of measurement was the agricultural household family, with nomadic pastoralists largely ignored. The total figures for such households was: 15,690 for <span class=\"place\" title=\"F3862\">Ngari</span> and <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15354\">Tsang</span> and 30,737 for <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15355\">&Uuml;</span>. The census was implemented for one overwhelming purpose: taxation. Beginning with the year of the census and lasting until the fall of the Yuan, Tibetans paid ten percent of annual agricultural produce to the Yuan-Sakya government.</p> <p>The Yuan-Sakya regime controlled Tibet for almost a century from the 1260s to the 1360s. Serious and persistent threat to <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15481\">Sakya</span> rule, and thus to Yuan rule on a local scale if not on a trans-regional scale, began to be felt from one of the myriarchies as early as the 1320s. This was the <span class=\"place\" title=\"F11608\">Pakmodru</span> myriarchy, whose leader <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Jangchup Gyeltsen</span> worked for four decades to lessen the grip of the <span class=\"place\" title=\"F11608\">Sakya</span> government on central Tibet. His story is told in a separate essay.</p> <h2><strong>Sources</strong></h2> <p>Luciano Petech, <em>Central Tibet and the Mongols: The Y&uuml;an-Sakya Period of Tibetan History</em>.

The history of this period was foundational for&nbsp;<span class=\"place\" title=\"F15481\">Sakya's</span>&nbsp;enduring status as an independent polity in later centuries, even as their power waned after the fall of the Yuan empire.</p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 9.83796px;\"><span class=\"place\" title=\"F15481\">Sakya</span>'s relationship with the Mongols began when the institution's most famous scholar, <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Sakya Pandita</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">sa skya paN+Di ta</span></em>,&nbsp;1182-1252), traveled to <span class=\"place\" title=\"F637\">Lhasa</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"F637\">lha sa</span></em>) in 1239 to meet representatives of the Mongol Emperor Godan, whose army had gained control of Tibetan territories to within one hundred miles of <span class=\"place\" title=\"F637\">Lhasa</span>. After making a good impression, <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Sakya Pandita</span> was invited to Godan's court in Liangjou, and travelled there with two nephews. One of these nephews, <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Phakpa</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">'phags pa</span></em>, 135-1280) remained at court after <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Sakya Pandita</span>'s death in 1251, and went on to become the imperial chaplain, or Ti shih, to emperor Kublai Khan. The emperor granted <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Phakpa</span>, and by extension <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15481\">Sakya</span>,&nbsp;rule over thirteen myriarchies, or land units containing ten thousand people. The combination of success at court and the control of major land holdings made <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Phakpa</span> the most powerful Tibetan leader in the late thirteenth century, and he used his wealth and prestige to transform <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15481\">Sakya</span>&nbsp;from a regional monastic and family compound to a major center of learning and administrative control.</span></p> <p>The death of <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Phakpa</span> in 1280 left a power vacuum in which members of the leading <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15481\">Sakya</span>&nbsp;families, the <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kh&ouml;n</span> foremost among them, vied for control of the Ti shih title and close connection with the Mongol court that came with it. Eventually four branches of the <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kh&ouml;n</span> family founded four separate administrative centers or <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">podrang</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">pho brang</span></em>): the <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Zhitok</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">gzhi thog</span></em>), <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Lhakhang</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">lha khang</span></em>), <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">D&uuml;ch&ouml;</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">dus mchod</span></em>), and <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Rinchengang</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">rin chen sgang</span></em>), each of which held control over sizeable land holdings. All save the <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">D&uuml;ch&ouml;</span> branch, which survived into the twentieth century, disappeared within several generations, but the internal power struggles created by their formation weakened the overall strength of <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15481\">Sakya</span>&nbsp;as a pan-Tibetan power. The creation of a new secular leadership position, the <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">p&ouml;nchen</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">dpon chen</span></em>), to govern political affairs at <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15481\">Sakya</span>&nbsp;while the Ti shih attended to his religious duties at the distant Mongol court added another layer of competition within the <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15481\">Sakya</span>&nbsp;hierarchy. Despite these internal struggles, <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15481\">Sakya</span>&nbsp;held a position of dominance within Tibetan politics for nearly a century, until the polity was defeated by its competitors from Central Tibet, the <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Phakmodru</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">phag mo gru</span></em>), in 1350.</p> <p>Even after its fall from power in the mid-fourteenth century, <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15481\">Sakya</span> retained the status of an independent government or <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">zhung</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">gzhung</span></em>) throughout the vicissitudes of central Tibetan politics. Throughout the centuries the <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15481\">Sakya</span>&nbsp;administration adopted a flexible approach to political alliances, and thereby succeeded in keeping the good graces of the major powers throughout the centuries. While they had the favor of the King of <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15354\">Tsang</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"F15354\">gtsang</span></em>) in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, they managed to stay out of disputes between <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15354\">Tsang</span> and <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15355\">&Uuml;</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"F15355\">dbus</span></em>), which ultimately lead to the defeat of <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15354\">Tsang</span> in 1642 and the formation of the new government, based in <span class=\"place\" title=\"F637\">Lhasa</span>, the <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15466\">Ganden Podrang</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"F15466\">dga' ldan pho brang</span></em>) of the Dalai Lamas. In the late seventeenth century <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15481\">Sakya</span>&nbsp;had good relations with the powerful Fifth Dalai Lama, and even mediated in a dispute between the Dalai Lama's government and Bhutan.</p> <p>The eighteenth century was a period of new expansion for the <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15481\">Sakya</span>. Members of the <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kh&ouml;n</span> family married into families as far east as <span class=\"place\" title=\"F5225\">Kham</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"F5225\">khams</span></em>), resulting in new territories, new areas of religious influence, and new connections with leaders across the plateau such as the Kings of <span class=\"place\" title=\"F16407\">Derg&eacute;</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"F16407\">sde dge</span></em>). However, local politics at <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15481\">Sakya</span> continued its tradition of internecine strife in the early nineteenth century when the <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kh&ouml;n</span> family split into three houses, <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Zhitok</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">gzhi thog</span></em>), <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dr&ouml;lma</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">sgrol ma</span></em>), and <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Phuntsok</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">phun tshogs</span></em>), which split the wealth of <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15481\">Sakya</span>'s land holdings between them. This arrangement lead to numerous disputes over leadership succession between the three rival houses, and the Dalai Lamas were called on to mediate disputes on several occasions from the early nineteenth through the early twentieth centuries.</p> <p>In 1960 members of the <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15481\">Sakya</span> royal family emigrated to the USA to settle in Seattle, Washington. Four members of the family served as informants in the first major work of American scholarship on a Tibetan polity, C. W. Cassinelli and Robert B. Ekvall's <em>A Tibetan Principality</em> (1969). These four included Ngawang Kungga S&ouml;nam, elder son of the Sakya leader Ngawang Thuthob Wangchuk, who served at the head of Sakya from 1936 to 1950; his wife S&ouml;nam Tsedzom; his younger brother, Ngawang Kungga Trinl&eacute;, and S&ouml;nam Tsedzom's uncle, the famous Sakya scholar from Kham, Dezhung Rinpoch&eacute;. In 1954 Ngawang Kungga S&ouml;nam and traveled with the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama to Beijing to meet with Mao Zedong. In 1959 he and his family went into exile in India before coming to the United States.</p> <h2><strong>Sakya Land and Subjects</strong></h2> <p>According to data from the informants mentioned above, in the 1930s <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15481\">Sakya</span> controlled eleven separate areas of land. Nine were in western Tibet, while two where six hundred miles away in Eastern Tibet. The central holding of <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15481\">Sakya</span>, formed over the centuries around <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15481\">Sakya</span> Monastery, consisted of approximately 2100 square miles of land, or something the size of the state of Delaware. This land support around 16,000 people, while the capital town held a population of some 7000 people. Most people living on <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15481\">Sakya</span> lands were adherents of the <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"F17088\">Sakya</span>&nbsp;tradition of Buddhism. Another major area was <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">M&uuml;</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">mus</span></em>), located to the north of <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15481\">Sakya</span> in the <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Jangthang</span> (<em><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">byang thang</span></em>) region. Much of <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15481\">Sakya</span>'s animal production was in <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">M&uuml;</span>.</p> <p>Within these lands the <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15481\">Sakya</span> leader, the <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">trichen</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">khri chen</span></em>, 'Great Throne') was the sovereign leader, and his government performed all administrative and legal duties within the bounds of <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15481\">Sakya</span> territory. This was recognized by the <span class=\"place\" title=\"F637\">Lhasa</span> government, as illustrated by the fact that, should its government members seek asylum at <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15481\">Sakya</span> in times of political trouble, <span class=\"place\" title=\"F637\">Lhasa</span> needed to seek formal extradition approval from the <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">trichen</span> to bring the dissident back to central Tibet. According to informants, this political separation did not stop people within <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15481\">Sakya</span> controlled territories from recognizing the Dalai Lama as the political leader of Tibet in the early twentieth century, and a potent symbol of Tibetan unity.</p> <p>People within <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15481\">Sakya</span> territories were termed \"subjects\" or <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">mis&eacute;</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">mi ser</span></em>) of the government or <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">zhung</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">gzhung</span></em>). As subjects they were required to pay allegiance to the laws and authoritiy of the government, and they were also required to pay an annual tax to the government itself, the monastery of <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"F17088\">Sakya</span>, one of the two ruling houses, or a member of the hereditary nobility. The group to which one would pay depended on which one held rights to the land upon which one lived and worked.</p> <h2><strong>Sakya Governance</strong></h2> <p>The <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15481\">Sakya</span> government consisted of a hierarchical leadership structure in which local headmen in charge of families and land holdings within a specific region reported to eight district officers, who in turn reported to the <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">zhapp&eacute;</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">zhabs pad</span></em>), the leader of religious affairs at the capital. Headmen ideally served as representatives of local interests to the central administration at <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15481\">Sakya</span>. Officials had no fixed term of office. When a local headman, for instance, was unable to continue their duties, committees consisting of family representatives would select his successor, ideally through consensus, and submit their choice to the <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">zhapp&eacute;</span> for approval.</p> <p>The central government consisted of some forty full-time administrators, eleven <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">jolak</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">jo lags</span></em>) officials, namely the district headmen, and thirty-nine high-ranking officials known by the honorific title of <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">kudrak</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">sku drag</span></em>). Collectively these positions functioned as assistants to the <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">trichen</span> and the <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">zhapp&eacute;</span> . <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kudrak</span> officials were comprised of members of <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"F17088\">Sakya</span>'s North and South monasteries, including the abbots, ex-abbots, chant masters, business managers, and others. These would meet together in \"Great Assembly Meetings\" called by either the <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">trichen</span> or the <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">zhapp&eacute;</span>.</p> <p>Few major decisions were left in the hands of district headmen or other lesser government officials, but were passed up to the highest levels of the central <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15481\">Sakya</span> government, the <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">trichen</span> and the <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">zhapp&eacute;</span>. The <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">trichen</span> was both a religious and a political leader, and might be considered the \"governor\" of <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15481\">Sakya</span>, though his power was shared by the <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">zhapp&eacute;</span>. He was the representative of the <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kh&ouml;n</span> family in the government, and as the representative of <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15481\">Sakya</span>'s founding family, the <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">trichen</span> was the only official who could carry out innovations in government policy. He appointed all abbots of the North and South monasteries, and controlled the annual schedule of religious observances in the monasteries. As the leader, if not abbot, of the central religious institution of the <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"F15481\">Sakya</span>, the <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">trichen</span> was held in high regard by all <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15481\">Sakya</span> subjects as a person of major religious power.</p> <p>The <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">zhapp&eacute;</span> was the manager of daily governmental affairs. Appointed by the <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">trichen</span>, the <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">zhapp&eacute;</span> served as the head administrator of the government and its official representative in external affairs. He controlled the government's official seal, and all letters to and from the <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15481\">Sakya</span> government were addressed to or by him alone. The <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">zhapp&eacute;</span> was granted large tracts of government land while in office, and this could generate massive wealth for holders of the position. Gifts were a major part of his income, for all who visited his office were expected to make an offering to him. The <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">zhapp&eacute;</span> authorized all new headmen, appointed all district officers, as well as most lesser government positions. He was also in control of the government supply house and archive, making it necessary to go through him to access any official information about the <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15481\">Sakya</span> territories. Ideally the <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">zhapp&eacute;</span> were selected from among candidates with long careers of government service.</p> <p>According to Cassinelli and Ekvall, the authors of the primary scholarly work in English on <span class=\"place\" title=\"F17088\">Sakya</span>, the government of <span class=\"place\" title=\"F15481\">Sakya</span> was in many ways an ideal small-sized polity, in that it managed to survive as an independent polity for nearly nine centuries. It played a central role in the development of Tibetan Buddhism, in political theory, and in the cultural life of western Tibet. Only the fall of Tibet in 1959 could bring an end to this polity, which had existed continuously since 1073.</p> <h2>Source</h2> <p>C. W. Cassinelli and Robert B.
