Name</h4> <p>Among the four temples (Nos.124-127), the local people call the first three as <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">lha khang</span> (temple) and the No.127 as <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">spyi khang</span>, &lsquo;commune house&rsquo;. While only the tantrics and monks in sTong che use the term <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">gsas khang</span>, &lsquo;temple&rsquo; since it is the Bonpo&rsquo;s own term for a temple, the common people use the word <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">lha khang</span>, e.g. sGar ba lha khang.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-4-1-2\">2. Location</h4> <p>The four temples are located in sTong che valley which is under the administration of Chu nub (Hexi) Township of Khri ka county, Tsolho (Hainan) Prefecture in Qinghai Province. sGar ba and sBra ser are located in Ba rgya village 16 km from the county town and gZe ma and sKa rgya are located in &rsquo;Bum kho village south of Khri ka mkhar, the county town of Khri ka.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-4-1-3\">3. History</h4> <p>About history of Bon religion in Khri ka, specifically in sTong che, the only text that briefly mentions about it, is the <em xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\">Gṣhen gyi dge sbyong khri ka ba kun bzang bstan pa&rsquo;i rgyal mtshan gyi rnam thar</em>, the autobiography of Khri ka Kun bzang bstan pa&rsquo;i rgyal mtshan who was born in sTong che valley, but unfortunately it has only eighteen leafs and is incomplete. So there is very little information regarding the history of Bon religion and its monasteries and temples in the area. According to oral tradition, the four temples were founded by Sog btsun Ye shes rgyal mtshan who also founded Khyung mo Monastery (No.123) located in the same area. It is said that Sog btsun Ye shes rgyal mtshan came from Sog sde of the Nag chu kha region<a href=\"#n2\" name=\"nb2\" class=\"note\">2</a> and according to gYung drung lhun grub, the master came from Tsan tan Monastery<a href=\"#n3\" name=\"nb3\" class=\"note\">3</a> situated in that region.</p> <p>The four temples were damaged at the end of the 1950s and were rebuilt in the 1980s.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-4-1-4\">4. Hierarchical system</h4> <p>The four temples have no special headship system. Masters from the three lineages of Khyung mo Monastery, i.e. Khyung mo, mKhar nag and sBra ser, had looked after the temples until the middle of the twentieth century. Presently it is Khyung mo sTobs ldan dbang phyug who takes care of the four temples. Since all of tantrics of the four temples practise their rituals together either in one temple or another, they are called sTong che Bon mang as a collective name, and also for this reason, they have only one suit of administrative system. However, among the tantrics of the present day, dBang ba is regarded as the leader of all tantrics. When they gather together in the temples for the rituals there are positions as follows:</p> <ul xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" class=\"bullet-blue\"> <li>none <span style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">dbu mdzad</span> appointed from one to four years, depending on his ability </li> <li>one <span style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">dge skos</span> appointed for one year</li> <li>one <span style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">gnyer pa</span> for one year</li> <li>one <span style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">mchod g-yog</span> for one year</li> </ul> <p>The positions must reelected by lay tantrics during the ritual of Khro brgya and replaced on the thirteenth of the first month each year before the ritual finishing.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-4-1-5\">5. Current number of tantrics</h4> <p>There are about seventy-five tantrics in the four temples together in sTong che valley and an additional thirty-five who come from the nomadic part of sTong che region.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-4-1-6\">7. Educational exchange</h4> <p>The tantrics of the four temples have a close relationship with Bon brgya dGe legs lhun grub rgya mtsho, the head of Bon brgya Monastery (No.100) in Reb gong. </p> <p>Either they invite him to give them teachings or they often go to Bon brgya Monastery in Reb gong to receive teachings from him.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-4-1-7\">8 / 9. Rituals</h4> <ul xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" class=\"bullet-blue\"> <li>first month: the ritual of Khro brgya from the 11th to 17th, the temples take turn to hold the ritual every year.</li> <li>4th month: ritual of gTer sgrub for a few days, dates are not fixed.</li> <li>8th month: ritual of Dam can rgya mtsho&rsquo;i tshogs &rsquo;khor from the 14th to 16th; this ritual must be performed in sKa rgya Temple.</li> <li>10th month: rituals of gZe ma, Kun bzang, and Khro bo are performed from the 22nd to 29th in the gZe ma Temple.</li> </ul> <h4 id=\"b6-4-1-8\">10. Books held in the temples</h4> <p>A copy of Bonpo Kanjur and Katen of the bsTan pa&rsquo;i nyi ma edition. In addition to these there are many ritual texts which are kept in the gZe ma Temple.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-4-1-9\">12. Local community</h4> <p>The devotees of the four temples are those who follow Khyung mo Monastery in sTong che. </p> <h4 id=\"b6-4-1-10\">14. Occupation of the local people</h4> <p>Agriculture</p> <h4 id=\"b6-4-1-11\">Sources</h4> <p>Interview </p> <p>In autumn of 1996 with Tshangs dbyangs, the teacher of Khyung mo sTobs ldan dbang phyug and Khyung mo sTobs ldan dbang phyug himself who is the head of Khyung mo Monastery</p> <h5 id=\"b6-4-1-11-1\">Texts:</h5> <ul xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" class=\"bullet-blue\"> <li> <span style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">KTGN</span> </li> <li> <span style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">KhKRL</span> </li> <li> <span style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">TsGLNy</span> </li> <li> <em>Sṭeng chen dgon grong gi lo rgyus lha mi dgyes pa&rsquo;i &rsquo;bel gtam</em> by gYung drung lhun grub, MS.</li> </ul> <hr class=\"footnote-divider\"/><h2>Notes</h2><div xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" class=\"footnote\"><a name=\"n1\"/><a href=\"#nb1\" class=\"note\"> [1] </a> At the beginning, this temple was known as dPon tshang lha khang since it was built by the chieftain of sTong che people.
