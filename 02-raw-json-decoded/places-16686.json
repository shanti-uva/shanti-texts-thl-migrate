The site enjoys good views in all directions but the west. The terrain is level and covered in sparse turf and small brush. The site consists of 11 in situ pillars erected inside an enclosure and what appears to be a large funerary superstructure. All the pillars of <span class=\"popular\">Marbuk Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dmar sbug rdo ring</span> are made of the same type of gray rock. They are heavily eroded and host orange climax lichen.</p> <h4 id=\"b2-1-44-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>In this region (<span class=\"popular\">Drongpa</span><span class=\"scholar\">&rsquo;Brong pa</span>), sites such as <span class=\"popular\">Marbuk Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dmar sbug rdo ring</span> are commonly associated with the primordial epoch and the <span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span> tribe of ancient times.</p> <h4 id=\"b2-1-44-4\">Site elements</h4> <h5 id=\"b2-1-44-4-1\">Enclosure</h5> <p>Only the east corner of the enclosure is intact. The enclosure appears to have been oriented in the intermediate points. The remaining wall fragment is of standard construction: a double-course (60 cm thick) structure composed of variable-length blocky stones (20 cm to 40 cm), which are either flush with the ground or which protrude slightly above the surface. The east corner of the enclosure is located 9 m from the row of pillars. The line of pillars stretches out over 3.2 m. The enclosure must have been somewhat wider than this. The ground that was situated inside the enclosure appears to have undergone significant geomorphologic changes and is now sloping. </p> <h5 id=\"b2-1-44-4-2\">Pillars</h5> <p>The four-sided specimens are very consistent, giving the impression that they may have been hewn into shape. The pillars form a U-shaped array. The eight pillars of the main row form a line near where the northwest wall of the enclosure must have existed. From southwest to northeast the pillars have the following dimensions and forms:</p> <ol> <li>Long-stone DR1: four-sided, broken (40 cm [height] x 80 cm [basal girth]). This specimen is offset from he main row of pillars and probably stands in close proximity to what must have been the southwest wall of he enclosure. </li> <li>Long-stone DR2: four-sided (60 cm x 70 cm).</li> <li>Long-stone DR3: four-sided (75 cm x 60 cm). </li> <li>Long-stone DR4: four-sided (1.3 m x 75 cm).</li> <li>Long-stone DR5: tabular (60 cm x 75 cm).</li> <li>Long-stone DR6: four-sided (80 cm x 75 cm).</li> <li>Long-stone DR7: four-sided (65 cm x 70 cm).</li> <li>Long-stone DR8: tabular (90 cm x 90 cm).</li> <li>Long-stone DR9: irregularly shaped (90 cm x 75 cm).</li> <li>Long-stone DR10: four-sided (60 cm x 1 m). This specimen is offset from the main row of pillars and probably stands in close proximity to what must have been the northeast wall of the enclosure. </li> <li>Long-stone DR11: tabular, broken (40 cm x 75 cm). This specimen is offset from the main row of pillars and probably stands in close proximity to what must have been the northeast wall of the enclosure. There is a collapsed pillar (65 cm long) near what must have been the northeast wall of the enclosure.</li> </ol> <h5 id=\"b2-1-44-4-3\">Outlying funerary structure</h5> <p>What appear to be the vestiges of a large funerary enclosure are located 28 m south of the pillars. The remaining U-shaped double-course wall fragment is 48 m long and perhaps 50 cm thick. The highly eroded, blocky stones in this wall are primarily 20 cm to 40 cm in length. The space enclosed by the wall gently slopes down to he east. A ravine now cuts through the base of the U-shaped structure, dislodging some of the stones. </p> <table cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\" class=\"navarrows\"> <tbody> <tr> <td class=\"leftcell\"> <a class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-left.gif\" title=\"Previous Section\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"midcell\"> <a class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-up.gif\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"rightcell\"> <a class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-right.gif\" title=\"Next Section\"/> </a> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div id=\"chap-id\">/bellezza2/b2-1-44/</div> <div style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\" class=\"jqmWindow\" id=\"chapRefWindow\"> <div class=\"closebtn\"> <a href=\"#\">Close</a> </div> <div style=\"height: 280px;\" class=\"conx-content\"> <h3>Note Citation for Page <span class=\"pgnm\"/> </h3> <p class=\"biblref\">John Vincent Bellezza, Antiquities of Zhang Zhung: A Comprehensive Inventory of Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Monuments on he Tibetan Upland (Charlottesville, VA 22904:Tibetan &amp; Himalayan Library, 2010), <span class=\"pgnm\"/>. </p> <h3>Bibliographic Citation</h3> <p>John Vincent Bellezza.
