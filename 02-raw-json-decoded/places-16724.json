This uninhabited area is known as <span class=\"popular\">Burts&eacute; Dok</span><span class=\"scholar\">&rsquo;Bur rtse dog</span> (Hill Peak Earth). The three standing pillars of <span class=\"popular\">Dowa Sumpa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo ba gsum pa</span> are found on a shelf that rises above the right bank of the <span class=\"popular\">Maja Tsangpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rma bya gtsang po</span>. The pillars are firmly planted, not far from the foot of the ridgeline that encloses he west side of the <span class=\"popular\">Purang M&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Spu rang smad</span> valley. The views from the site are quite open in all directions. The terrain slopes gently down towards the river and is covered in cobbles, which is consistent with the aftermath of a flood event. If there ever was an enclosure around he pillars, it was destroyed by such flooding. The three pillars form an uneven north-south row and are nearly equidistant to one another. All three pillars are made of a soft gray calcareous stone. The pillars are covered in a red encrustation, the result of geochemical processes.<a href=\"#n49\" name=\"nb49\" class=\"note\">49</a> </p> <h4 id=\"b2-1-82-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>Local villagers consider <span class=\"popular emph\">Dowa Sumpa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rdo ba gsum pa</span> to be an ancient monument. According to a local myth, the three standing pillars are the sons of the prostrate pillar, heir mother. They are said to have sprung up after her death. </p> <h4 id=\"b2-1-82-4\">Site elements</h4> <p>From north to south, the three pillars have the following dimensions and characteristics:</p> <ol> <li>Long-stone DR1: four-sided (1.4 m [height] x 1 m [basal girth]).</li> <li>Long-stone DR2: four-sided (1 m x 1.1 m). DR2 is situated 3.2 m south of DR1.</li> <li>Long-stone DR3: tabular, its broad sides face east and west (1.3 m x 1.3 m). DR3 is situated 3.5 m south of DR2. Next to DR3 there is a collapsed specimen 1.6 m in length (a portion of this pillar is submerged in the ground so it could be somewhat longer than the figure provided here).</li> </ol> <hr class=\"footnote-divider\"/> <h2>Notes</h2> <div class=\"footnote\"> <a name=\"n49\"/> <a href=\"#nb49\" class=\"note\"> [49] </a> Perhaps the<span class=\"popular\">Dowa Sumpa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo ba gsum pa</span> pillars acted as inspiration for the creation of the famous tabular stele in <span class=\"popular\">Zhid&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Zhi bde</span>. This stele has a lovely bas relief image of <span class=\"popular\">Pakpa Chenrezik</span><span class=\"scholar\">&rsquo;Phags pa spyan ras gzigs</span> on one of its broad sides, and on its two narrow sides there are inscriptions celebrating the cult of this deity. This stele was probably made in the 10th century CE as part of the definitive conversion of the region to Buddhism. </div> <table cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\" class=\"navarrows\"> <tbody> <tr> <td class=\"leftcell\"> <a class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-left.gif\" title=\"Previous Section\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"midcell\"> <a class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-up.gif\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"rightcell\"> <a class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-right.gif\" title=\"Next Section\"/> </a> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div id=\"chap-id\">/bellezza2/b2-1-82/</div> <div style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\" class=\"jqmWindow\" id=\"chapRefWindow\"> <div class=\"closebtn\"> <a href=\"#\">Close</a> </div> <div style=\"height: 280px;\" class=\"conx-content\"> <h3>Note Citation for Page <span class=\"pgnm\"/> </h3> <p class=\"biblref\">John Vincent Bellezza, Antiquities of Zhang Zhung: A Comprehensive Inventory of Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Monuments on he Tibetan Upland (Charlottesville, VA 22904:Tibetan &amp; Himalayan Library, 2010), <span class=\"pgnm\"/>. </p> <h3>Bibliographic Citation</h3> <p>John Vincent Bellezza.
