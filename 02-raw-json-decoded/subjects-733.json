Their southern ethno-linguistic border is with Gyarong (rgyal rong) speakers and the Qiang ethnic group. From the Sharwa and their neighbors the Dakpo (dwags po) northward throughout an easternmost zone of mountain and valley lands, all the way via Choni to Labrang (bla brang), there are further Tibetan agricultural communities who speak variations on the Amdo agrarian dialect. These groups used to be collectively called the Thewo (mthe bo), a name already found in Dunhuang documents). They should probably be considered for another ethno-linguistic unit or block, but needs more research to establish the extent of it.
