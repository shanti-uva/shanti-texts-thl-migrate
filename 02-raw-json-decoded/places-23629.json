Dolpa) District</h2> <h3 id=\"b7-2-4\">(223) bSam gling Monastery</h3> <h4 id=\"b7-2-4-1\">1. Name of monastery</h4> <p>There are two temples in bSam gling. The main one is called rGyal gshen ya ngal gdan sa bSam gtan gling dgon, more popularly known as Yang ston dgon pa. (Yang ston is a contraction of Ya ngal gyi ston pa, the &ldquo;teachers of the Ya ngal clan&rdquo;).</p> <h4 id=\"b7-2-4-2\">2. Location</h4> <p>Close to Phijor village. (Phijor is the Nepalicised form of the local name that is pronounced &ldquo;bicher&rdquo;, and in Tibetan is spelt in a variety of ways, e.g. Bi cher, Bi cer, Byi tsher etc.) </p> <h4 id=\"b7-2-4-3\">3. History</h4> <p>Part of the history of the temple is related in the Ya ngal gdung rabs (see below). Khyung po &rsquo;Chi med g-yung drung provided the following supplementary information. The temple was built more than 900 years ago by Yang ston rGyal mtshan rin chen. The latter had been staying near Mt. Kailash, where he had a dream in which he received a visit from Dran pa nam mkha&rsquo;. He was told to go to Dolpo and to build a temple there. Shortly after this dream he left Tibet for Dolpo, travelling through Saldang, Namdo and Bi cher. At that time the village of Bi cher already existed and contained a prayer-hall, a prayer-wheel and several statues. Yang ston rGyal mtshan rin chen searched in many places until he found bSam gling, and the various auspicious dreams he had while staying there persuaded him that this was the place in which he should build a monastery.</p> <h4 id=\"b7-2-4-4\">4. Hierarchical system</h4> <p>Male lineage inheritance system at the Khyung po temple.</p> <h4 id=\"b7-2-4-5\">5.
