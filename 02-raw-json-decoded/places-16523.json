On the summit there is a small flagpole.</li> </ul> <h4 id=\"b1-1-42-2\">General site characteristics</h4> <p>The fairly small (1100 m&sup2;) but adeptly constructed <span class=\"popular\">Chulung Okma</span><span class=\"scholar\">Chu lung &rsquo;og ma</span> was founded on a granite hill overlooking the confluence of the <span class=\"popular\">Chulung Okma</span><span class=\"scholar\">Chu lung &rsquo;og ma</span> and <span class=\"popular\">Rutok</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ru thog</span> valleys. It possesses a strategic position in the middle of this important agricultural locality. The facility covers the summit and east flank of the formation almost to its base. The relatively long wall spans are not buttressed, indicating that most structures were built with wooden roofs. The stronghold was constructed of random-texture granite cobbles. These stones tend to be smaller in size (10 cm to 50 cm in length). Most of the mud-mortar that cemented the walls has washed away. </p> <h4 id=\"b1-1-42-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>According to local villagers, <span class=\"popular\">Chulung Okma</span><span class=\"scholar\">Chu lung &rsquo;og ma</span> was a castle that guarded the western portal of <span class=\"popular\">Shenpa Meruts&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bshan pa sme ru rtse</span>&rsquo;s <span class=\"popular\">Hor</span><span class=\"scholar\">Hor</span> kingdom in <span class=\"popular\">Rutok</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ru thog</span> (see fn. 80). </p> <h4 id=\"b1-1-42-4\">Site elements</h4> <h5 id=\"b1-1-42-4-1\">Castle</h5> <p>There were around ten rooms in several buildings packed on the two levels of the summit (20 m x 15 m). The maximum external wall elevation is 4.5 m (including the revetments) and interior wall segments reach 2.7 m. There are several window openings in walls, measuring around 30 cm x 30 cm. The lower sector runs for 40 m along he angle of the slope and is around 23 m in width. Most of the east flank structures are highly degraded. The exception is near the base of the hill where four small buildings have most of their walls intact. The largest of these buildings measures 5.5 m x 4.8 m. These four structures represent a later phase in the development of he site. Other minor structures near the foot of the <span class=\"popular\">Chulung Okma Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Chu lung &rsquo;og ma mkhar</span> formation have been redeveloped for pastoral usage. </p> <h5 id=\"b1-1-42-4-2\">&rsquo;O ma dkar chung</h5> <p>The <span class=\"popular\">Oma Karchung</span><span class=\"scholar\">&rsquo;O ma dkar chung</span> (Little White Milk) <span class=\"popular emph\">Ch&ouml;rten</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mchod rten</span> is located northwest of <span class=\"popular\">Chulung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Chu lung</span> village. According to local legend, three ancient religious practitioners called <span class=\"popular\">Jomo P&uuml;nsum</span><span class=\"scholar\">Jo mo spun gsum</span> (Three Sister Mistresses) built it. One of them made a spring magically appear, providing the water needed for construction. Another sister milked a wild yak (<span class=\"popular emph\">drong</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">&rsquo;brong</span>) to obtain milk to color the <span class=\"popular emph\">Ch&ouml;rten</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mchod rten</span>, while the third sister actually built the structure. The monument has no real spire (<span class=\"popular emph\">khorlo</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">&rsquo;khor lo</span>), just a simple bulbous finial. </p> <table cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\" class=\"navarrows\"> <tbody> <tr> <td class=\"leftcell\"> <a class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-left.gif\" title=\"Previous Section\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"midcell\"> <a class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-up.gif\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"rightcell\"> <a class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-right.gif\" title=\"Next Section\"/> </a> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div id=\"chap-id\">/bellezza/b1-1-42/</div> <div style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\" class=\"jqmWindow\" id=\"chapRefWindow\"> <div class=\"closebtn\"> <a href=\"#\">Close</a> </div> <div style=\"height: 280px;\" class=\"conx-content\"> <h3>Note Citation for Page <span class=\"pgnm\"/> </h3> <p class=\"biblref\">John Vincent Bellezza, Antiquities of Zhang Zhung: A Comprehensive Inventory of Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Monuments on he Tibetan Upland (Charlottesville, VA 22904:Tibetan &amp; Himalayan Library, 2010), <span class=\"pgnm\"/>. </p> <h3>Bibliographic Citation</h3> <p>John Vincent Bellezza.
