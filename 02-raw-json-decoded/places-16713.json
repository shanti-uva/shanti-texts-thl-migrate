The site is found on the north flank of the <span class=\"popular\">Zhungchu</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gzhung chu</span> valley and is surrounded by the herder&rsquo;s hamlet of <span class=\"popular\">Ngoring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sngo ring</span>. The terrain is sandy, turf covered and gently sloping. These white granite pillars were erected inside an enclosure. This enclosure appears to be of a design at variance with the standard double-course enclosures in which type II.1b pillars are planted. </p> <h4 id=\"b2-1-71-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>The enclosure of <span class=\"popular\">Ngoring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sngo ring</span> is locally referred o as a <span class=\"popular emph\">m&ouml;ndo ra</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mon rdo ra</span> (<span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span> stone enclosure), and is associated with the ancient <span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span>. <span class=\"popular\">Ngoring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sngo ring</span> is one of the most easterly archaeological sites in Upper Tibet that is attributed to the <span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span>. </p> <h4 id=\"b2-1-71-4\">Site elements</h4> <h5 id=\"b2-1-71-4-1\">Enclosure</h5> <p>The enclosure approximately measures 8.5 m x 6 m. The enclosure is highly fragmentary and its lower part has been heavily impacted by geomorphologic changes. Its configuration and mode of construction are not clear. There is a little structural evidence to suggest that the perimeter walls were of the double-course variety. The enclosure was not aligned in the cardinal directions. Uncut pieces of white granite, up to 1.2 m in length, went into its construction. Some of these stones protrude prominently from the ground surface. This enclosure appears o represent a transitional monumental form between the isolated pillars of the far eastern <span class=\"popular\">Jangtang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Byang thang</span> (see C-7 and C-36) and those enclosed inside well-delineated walls common farther west. The enclosure of <span class=\"popular\">Ngoring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sngo ring</span> may have been of more rudimentary construction. </p> <h5 id=\"b2-1-71-4-2\">Pillars</h5> <p>The pillars stand in the upper portion of the enclosure. The three standing specimens are spread out over a distance of 3 m. Their position relative to the enclosure is not clear. These white granite pillars are heavily worn and discolored in places:</p> <p>North pillar: four-sided (85 cm [height] x 90 cm [basal girth]).</p> <p>Central Pillar: irregularly shaped (1.4 m x 1.1 m).</p> <p>South pillar: irregularly shaped (70 cm x 1.1 m). There is also a collapsed pillar in close proximity, which may still be rooted in the ground. </p> <hr class=\"footnote-divider\"/> <h2>Notes</h2> <div class=\"footnote\"> <a name=\"n43\"/> <a href=\"#nb43\" class=\"note\"> [43] </a> <span class=\"popular\">Ngoring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sngo ring</span> was discovered by the Roerich Central Asian Expedition (RCAE) on March 23, 1928. George Roerich reports that three menhirs were found with stone slabs arranged around them in a square (George N. Roerich, <em>Trails to Inmost Asia: Five Years of Exploration with the Roerich Central Asian Expedition</em>. reprint edition, (Delhi: Book Faith India, 1996), 416, 417). He notes that no traces of libations were found at the site, and he concludes hat this &lsquo;sanctuary&rsquo; was probably abandoned a long time ago. Roerich characterized the menhirs discovered on the RCAE as pre-Buddhistic sites, belonging to a phase in Tibetan history dominated by &ldquo;primitive B&ouml;n&rdquo; (Roerich. <em>Trails to Inmost Asia</em>. 355). After discovering the menhirs, Roerich ells us that the RCAE camped at a location called Ratri, 22 miles southwest of Do-ring (see C-162), and from there around the north side of <span class=\"popular\">Gomang Tso</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sgo mang mtsho</span>the next day. Ratri is described by Roerich as a locale with granite slopes. Ratri can be no other than <span class=\"popular\">ratra</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ra gra</span> (sp.?) (31&deg; 19.1&#900; N. long / 89&deg; 15.1&#900; E. long. / 4680 m), a location a little downstream of <span class=\"popular\">Ngoring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sngo ring</span> (this general area is dominated by granite formations). Inquiries with local <span class=\"popular emph\">drok pa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">&rsquo;brog pa</span> revealed that there is no other place in the <span class=\"popular\">Gomang Tso</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sgo mang mtsho</span> basin with a name that, in the <span class=\"popular\">Hor</span><span class=\"scholar\">Hor</span> dialect, is phonetically similar to &lsquo;Ratri&rsquo;. Furthermore, in his account, Roerich notes that Ratri is located 22 miles south of the megalithic site of Do-ring. Roerich&rsquo;s Do-ring has been identified as <span class=\"popular\">Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo ring</span> (South) (31&deg; 22.7 N. lat. / 89&deg; 26.0 E. long.), situated 22 km (as the crow flies) northeast of <span class=\"popular\">Ngoring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sngo ring</span> (see C-162) and 25 km northeast of <span class=\"popular\">ratra</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ra gra</span>.
