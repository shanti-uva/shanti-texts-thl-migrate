This conical hill has commanding views south over the <span class=\"popular\">Purang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Spu rang</span> valley. Occupying an extremely strategic location, the old stronghold straddled the route between the pastoral highlands of <span class=\"popular\">Purang T&ouml;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Spu rang stod</span> and the agricultural valleys of <span class=\"popular\">Purang M&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Spu rang smad</span>. Important lines of trade and communication are likely to have been controlled from this point. Earthen wall remnants on the north side of the summit are identified as belonging to a <span class=\"popular emph\">ten chidar</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">bstan phyi dar</span> era monastery. Dissolving foundations and revetments to the south of this ruined monastery are reported to be the races of <span class=\"popular\">Kardung Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dkar dung mkhar</span>. This facility appears to have consisted primarily of earthen structures. There are also highly obscured cobble wall fragments. A reliquary <span class=\"popular emph\">Ch&ouml;rten</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mchod rten</span> of a personality known as <span class=\"popular\">Kyiu Tsampa Rinpoch&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Skyi&rsquo;u mtshams pa rin po che</span> now stands on the ruins of <span class=\"popular\">Kardung Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dkar dung mkhar</span>. Below the summit on a wide shelf are thickly arrayed cobble foundations of what is supposed to have been the original village of <span class=\"popular\">Kardung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dkar dung</span>. Ancient habitations in Upper Tibet were customarily situated above the valley bottoms on high ground. On the flanks of the <span class=\"popular\">Kardung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dkar dung</span> hill are shrines to the local protective deities, <span class=\"popular\">Makzor Gyelpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dmag zor rgyal mo</span> and <span class=\"popular\">Medo Lhatsen</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mes do lha btsan</span> (the <span class=\"popular\">y&uuml;llha</span><span class=\"scholar\">Yul lha</span> of <span class=\"popular\">Langa Tso</span><span class=\"scholar\">La lnga mtsho</span>). </p> <h4 id=\"b1-1-54-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>According to elders of <span class=\"popular\">Kardung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dkar dung</span> village (including its religious head, <span class=\"popular\">Ng&ouml;drup Dorje</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dngos grub rdo rje</span>), the first fortress of <span class=\"popular\">Kardung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dkar dung</span>, <span class=\"popular\">Kardung Khyungdzong Karmo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dkar dung khyung rdzong dkar mo</span>, was founded no less than 900 years ago. At around that time a Buddhist monastery known as <span class=\"popular\">Mangdzhuk G&ouml;npa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mang bzhug dgon pa</span> was also established on the north side of the summit.<a href=\"#n51\" name=\"nb51\" class=\"note\">51</a> It was eventually destroyed by the <span class=\"popular\">Singpa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sing pa</span> (probably the Ladakhi). In the time of the fortress, the village of <span class=\"popular\">Kardung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dkar dung</span> was situated on a bench elevated above the south and west foot of the <span class=\"popular\">Kardung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dkar dung</span> hill. It is said that around 100 residences were once located here. South of mang bzhung dgon pa, a <span class=\"popular emph\">Nyingma</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rnying ma</span> monastery associated with <span class=\"popular\">Namkha Khyungdzong</span><span class=\"scholar\">Nam mkha&rsquo; khyung rdzong</span> (a well-known 19th century religious center nestled in the <span class=\"popular\">Purang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Spu rang</span> Himalaya) was eventually built. It was destroyed in the Chinese Cultural Revolution. This monastery stands on the site of the old fortress, as does the recently built <span class=\"popular\">Mani Lhakhang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ma &#7751;i lha khang</span>. Local sources also state that the <span class=\"popular\">Kardung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dkar dung</span> hill was once encircled by a defensive wall punctuated by four gateways. <span class=\"popular\">Tsering Ch&ouml;mpel</span><span class=\"scholar\">Tshe ring chos &rsquo;phel</span>, a cultural luminary residing in India, opines (in personal communication) that the fortress of <span class=\"popular\">Kardung Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dkar dung mkhar</span> may date to pre-Buddhist times (the prominent geographic position of the site encourages such speculation). </p> <hr class=\"footnote-divider\"/> <h2>Notes</h2> <div class=\"footnote\"> <a name=\"n51\"/> <a href=\"#nb51\" class=\"note\"> [51] </a> According to the historical text <span class=\"popular emph\">Khorchak G&ouml;np&eacute; Logy&uuml; Depter Ng&uuml;l Kuch&eacute; Sum Gi Ng&ouml;njung Tam</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">&rsquo;Khor chags dgon pa&rsquo;i lo rgyus deb gter dngul sku mched gsum gyi sngon byung gtam</span>, in the tenth century CE, the king of <span class=\"popular\">Purang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Spu rang</span> under the behest of the great <span class=\"popular\">Kardung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dkar dung</span> master <span class=\"popular\">Ch&ouml;j&eacute; Dzamling Drakpa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Chos rje &rsquo;dzam gling grags pa</span> founded the monastery of <span class=\"popular\">Serkhar Drakp&eacute; Tsuklak Khang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gser mkhar grags pa&rsquo;i gtsug lag khang</span>, as well as a lower and upper castle at <span class=\"popular\">Kardung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dkar dung</span> (<span class=\"popular\">Guge Tsering Gyelpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ge tshe ring rgyal po</span>, <span class=\"popular emph\">nga ri ch&ouml; jung</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">Mnga&rsquo; ris chos &rsquo;byung</span>, 115). </div> <table cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\" class=\"navarrows\"> <tbody> <tr> <td class=\"leftcell\"> <a class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-left.gif\" title=\"Previous Section\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"midcell\"> <a class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-up.gif\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"rightcell\"> <a class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-right.gif\" title=\"Next Section\"/> </a> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div id=\"chap-id\">/bellezza/b1-1-54/</div> <div style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\" class=\"jqmWindow\" id=\"chapRefWindow\"> <div class=\"closebtn\"> <a href=\"#\">Close</a> </div> <div style=\"height: 280px;\" class=\"conx-content\"> <h3>Note Citation for Page <span class=\"pgnm\"/> </h3> <p class=\"biblref\">John Vincent Bellezza, Antiquities of Zhang Zhung: A Comprehensive Inventory of Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Monuments on he Tibetan Upland (Charlottesville, VA 22904:Tibetan &amp; Himalayan Library, 2010), <span class=\"pgnm\"/>. </p> <h3>Bibliographic Citation</h3> <p>John Vincent Bellezza.
