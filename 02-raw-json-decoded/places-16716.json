This stream debouches into the east side of <span class=\"popular\">Drakpo Tso</span><span class=\"scholar\">Brag po mtsho</span>. The valley is ruled by a red escarpment, he territorial deity (<span class=\"popular\">y&uuml;llha</span><span class=\"scholar\">Yul lha</span>), <span class=\"popular\">Nyenta</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gnyan rta</span>. <span class=\"popular\">Nyanta Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gnyan rta rdo ring</span> is situated near the right edge of the valley. As he <span class=\"popular\">Nyenta</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gnyan rta</span> valley is narrow, there are only wide open views west towards the <span class=\"popular\">Drakpo Tso</span><span class=\"scholar\">Brag po mtsho</span> basin, an unusual orientation. The lake from the site, however, is just out of view. The terrain is gently sloping, sandy and spotted with turf. The site consists of an enclosure with four in situ pillars. The existence of <span class=\"popular\">Nyanta Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gnyan rta rdo ring</span> demonstrates that his region was settled long before the current <span class=\"popular emph\">drok pa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">&rsquo;brog pa</span> tribes began to arrive in the 17th century CE.<a href=\"#n44\" name=\"nb44\" class=\"note\">44</a> </p> <h4 id=\"b2-1-74-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p> <span class=\"popular\">Nyanta Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gnyan rta rdo ring</span> is said to be under the protection of the local territorial deity <span class=\"popular\">Nyenta</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gnyan rta</span>. </p> <h4 id=\"b2-1-74-4\">Site elements</h4> <h5 id=\"b2-1-74-4-1\">Enclosure</h5> <p>The not well aligned enclosure measures 5.3 m (north-south) x 6.1 m (east-west). Parts of all four double-course walls have survived. The enclosure walls are around 60 cm in thickness, and are composed of variable length (20 cm to 60 cm long) blocks and slabs laid flush with the ground surface or which project above it a maximum of 20 cm. A blue-gray metamorphic rock was used to build the enclosure. In the east/downhill wall here is a slab that runs perpendicular to the wall course. This slab may be the remains of a ritual portal. </p> <h5 id=\"b2-1-74-4-2\">Pillars</h5> <p>The four well-worn pillars were erected near the inner edge of the west wall of the enclosure. As is customary, he two broad sides of the tabular specimens are parallel to the north and south walls of the enclosure. From north to south, the pillars have the following dimensions and characteristics:</p> <p>Long-stone DR1: tabular, blue-gray (55 cm [height] x 90 cm [basal girth]).</p> <p>Long-stone DR2: tabular, grayish (60 cm x 65 cm).</p> <p>Long-stone DR3: tabular, blue-gray (70 cm x 1 m).</p> <p>Long-stone DR4: a smaller, four-sided reddish sandstone pillar with a broken top (35 cm x 50 cm). </p> <hr class=\"footnote-divider\"/> <h2>Notes</h2> <div class=\"footnote\"> <a name=\"n44\"/> <a href=\"#nb44\" class=\"note\"> [44] </a> Northern <span class=\"popular\">Gerts&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sger rtse</span> is populated by members of the <span class=\"popular\">Ngoro Korch&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rngo ro skor mched</span> tribe of <span class=\"popular\">Khampa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Khams pa</span> origins.
