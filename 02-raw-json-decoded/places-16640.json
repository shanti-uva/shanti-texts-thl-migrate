This is borne out by the highly developed nature of the architecture and patterns of habitation, which demanded considerable mainland economic resources to establish and maintain. These sheltered communities sprang up on every island of noteworthy size in the region (see fn. 167).

The northeast specimen (1.4 m x 1.6 m x 80 cm) is situated 1 m north of the southeast specimen. A few white concretion blocks were placed on top of this heavily damaged structure.

For instance, the two rear rooms of the structure are partly intact, probably because they were maintained by Buddhist meditators. The rear outer wall currently has an exterior height of 1.3 m and an interior height of 1 m. The roof of the rear west room (2 m x 2.1 m) is partly in place. The roof sheathing is composed of a bluish calcareous rock that forms neat slabs (up to 1.2 m long). There are several small niches in he rear wall and the vestiges of mud plaster. The forward wall and the wall separating the rear west room from its eastern counterpart are also partly intact. These walls are of typical random-rubble construction and are primarily composed of \u003cspan class=\"popular\"\u003eDomuk\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"scholar\"\u003eDo smug\u003c/span\u003e\u0026rsquo;s bluish metamorphic rock. The rear east room (2.1 m x 1.8 m) has niches in its rear and west walls. The forward tier of RS1 has been mostly destroyed. Measuring 6.4 m (east-west) x 2.9 m (north-south), it appears to have been comprised of a combination of rooms and open areas. Although there are small coherent wall fragments (up to 1 m high), the forward outer wall of RS1 has been largely reduced to rubble. In what is left of the east wall there are a few well-worn adobe blocks, signaling that the structure was rehabilitated for a more recent occupation. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe traces of a more recently constructed building are situated in the valley bottom 4.5 m east of RS1. It almost certainly belonged to the Buddhists. This carcass has an L-shaped plan and maximum dimensions of 4.5 m (east-west) x 5.5 m (north-south). Except for north and east wall segments, the structure has been leveled to its foundations. The walls are lightly built and only around 35 cm thick. The north wall segment has courses of adobe blocks above the stonework. These crude and insubstantial random-rubble walls are ypical of later historic Lamaist architecture in southwestern Tibet. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eImmediately south of RS1 there are fragmentary wall footings that cover an area measuring 5.8 m x 4.6 m.

It was built near the base of a south-facing slope just below a rock outcrop. It measures 9.5 m (east-west) x 10.3 m (north-south). The amount of rubble at the site indicates that this was a heavily-built structure. Just southeast of this edifice there is a shepherd\u0026rsquo;s enclosure (\u003cspan class=\"popular emph\"\u003edroklh\u0026eacute;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"scholar emph\"\u003e\u0026rsquo;brog lhas\u003c/span\u003e) (4 m x 4.5 m) built with stones commandeered from the archaeological asset. RS2 was built in three distinct elevations: south/forward, central and north/rear. In each of these three tiers here appears to have been two or three rooms. The east side of the structure is not so clearly demarcated and may have contained a courtyard or landing as well as rooms. The forward wall of RS2, now nothing more than a heap of stones, is elevated about 1 m above the slope. Most of the rest of the structure has also been reduced o piles of stones. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe rear of the RS2 edifice is the only place that the ground plan can be distinguished. There is a rear west room and a rear central room. The configuration of the east side of the rear tier is no longer discernable. The rear west room (2.6 m x 2 m) is divided by a partition wall (1.2 m long, 80 cm high, 45 cm thick) into north and south sections. The north section of this room is elevated about 50 cm above the south section. The north section had a low ceiling and may have had a ritual rather than habitational function. The rear/north wall of rear central room (2.3 m x 1.8 m) was built at least 1.1 m into the uphill slope. This wall originally was more deeply inset but some infilling of the rear central room has occurred. In the rear wall there are two large niches separated from one another by a single slab of stone. Mud plaster sticks to the back wall of the rear central room. One piece of the roof sheathing (80 cm x 90 cm) is still attached to the back wall of the rear central room. Parts of the west wall (up to 1.2 m high) and east wall (up to 50 cm high) of the rear central room are intact. Above the top of the rear wall, which is now flush with the slope, there are the remnants of a parapet wall, 50 cm in height. Roof appurtenances (up to 1.3 m long) are scattered around the RS2 carcass.\u003c/p\u003e \u003ctable cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\" class=\"navarrows\"\u003e \u003ctbody\u003e \u003ctr\u003e \u003ctd class=\"leftcell\"\u003e \u003ca class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"\u003e \u003cimg src=\"/global/images/arrow-left.gif\" title=\"Previous Section\"/\u003e \u003c/a\u003e \u003c/td\u003e \u003ctd class=\"midcell\"\u003e \u003ca class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"\u003e \u003cimg src=\"/global/images/arrow-up.gif\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"/\u003e \u003c/a\u003e \u003c/td\u003e \u003ctd class=\"rightcell\"\u003e \u003ca class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"\u003e \u003cimg src=\"/global/images/arrow-right.gif\" title=\"Next Section\"/\u003e \u003c/a\u003e \u003c/td\u003e \u003c/tr\u003e \u003c/tbody\u003e \u003c/table\u003e \u003c/div\u003e \u003cdiv id=\"chap-id\"\u003e/bellezza/b1-2-66/\u003c/div\u003e \u003cdiv style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\" class=\"jqmWindow\" id=\"chapRefWindow\"\u003e \u003cdiv class=\"closebtn\"\u003e \u003ca href=\"#\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/div\u003e \u003cdiv style=\"height: 280px;\" class=\"conx-content\"\u003e \u003ch3\u003eNote Citation for Page \u003cspan class=\"pgnm\"/\u003e \u003c/h3\u003e \u003cp class=\"biblref\"\u003eJohn Vincent Bellezza, Antiquities of Zhang Zhung: A Comprehensive Inventory of Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Monuments on he Tibetan Upland (Charlottesville, VA 22904:Tibetan \u0026amp; Himalayan Library, 2010), \u003cspan class=\"pgnm\"/\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e \u003ch3\u003eBibliographic Citation\u003c/h3\u003e \u003cp\u003eJohn Vincent Bellezza.
