Name</h4> <p>The monastery&rsquo;s full name is The brag Nyos zhing or The chu&rsquo;i brag dkar bya rgod dgon smin grol nor bu&rsquo;i gling. It is also known as Nyi shar, because it is located near a rock called Nyi shar brag. The most sacred mountain in the area, Brag dkar bya sgod, is located immediately behind the monastery and thus the monastery is also known as Brag dkar bya sgod.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-15-5-2\">2. Location</h4> <p>The monastery is located at the foot of Mount Brag dkar bya rgod, about 131 km north of sTag tsha, the seat of mDzod dge county.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-15-5-3\">3. History</h4> <p>The bo township of mDzod dge county is geographically and traditionally part of The bo county in present day Kan lho Prefecture, Kansu Province. In the 13th Rab yung (1747-1806), at the time of gZa&rsquo; ru Khro rgyal, the chief of the gZa&rsquo; ru tribe, there was a village called Bon sde stod ma near gTso tshang Monastery (No.91), whose religious gathering place was a temple of A skyid sKyang tshang Monastery (No.194) in Ma ru village of gZa&rsquo; ru tribe where a few monks lived, known as Bon sde stod ma. But as the religious practitioners did not live according to monastic vows, it was decided that the monastery should be moved to a more isolated spot. Thus A tshogs tshang of A skyid sKyang tshang Monastery bought the present site of the monastery in exchange for a white cow and other goods. The new monastery was named Nyos zhing, literally &ldquo;field that was bought&rdquo;. After the monastery was completed, the monasteries of sKyang tshang, gTso tshang and the local lay community decided that since it was A tshogs tshang who built the monastery, it would remain a branch of sKyang tshang Monastery, but that since it was located nearer gTso tshang, the latter would take charge of the monastery and the chief of the local gZa&rsquo; ru tribe would be the monastery&rsquo;s patron. The agreement was committed to writing and signed by all parties. Thus rGyal ba g-yung drung phun tshogs of sKyang tshang and gYung drung bstan &rsquo;dzin of gTso tshang are counted as the first of its patriarchs.</p> <ol type=\"1\"> <li>rGyal ba g-yung drung phun tshogs and gYung drung bstan &rsquo;dzin</li> <li>gTso bla bSod nams phun tshogs alias A bsod tshang </li> <li>gTso bla bDe chen dbang &rsquo;dus </li> <li>gTso bla bSod nams dbang grags </li> <li>gTso dbon bsTan &rsquo;dzin dbang rgyal alias A khu bsTan rgyal tshang, also known as gTso dbon rgan </li> <li>gTso dbon Zla ba rgyal mtshan, a nephew of the 5th </li> <li>gTso dGra &rsquo;dul mgon po (1932-1971) was recognized as the rebirth of A khu bsTan rgyal tshang by gTso dbon Zla ba rgyal mtshan. He was the first reincarnation of the monastery. The monastery was rebuilt in the 1980s. The master appoints a bla ma to take care of the monastery in his absence. The present head of Nyos zhing Monastery is Shes rab dbang rgyal. He is still also the head of gTso tshang Monastery.</li> </ol> <h4 id=\"b6-15-5-4\">4.
