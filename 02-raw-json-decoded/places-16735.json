It is situated in a region of <span class=\"popular\">Namru</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gnam ru</span> traditionally known as <span class=\"popular\">Ringpa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ring pa</span>. The watercourse of the <span class=\"popular\">Domilang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo mi lang</span> valley drains into the <span class=\"popular\">Jakar Tsangpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ja dkar gtsang po</span>. The terrain is level, sandy and turf-covered. </p> <h4 id=\"b2-1-70-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>One common oral tradition of <span class=\"popular\">Namru</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gnam ru</span> holds that <span class=\"popular\">Domilang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo mi lang</span> emerged with existence in the primal epoch. Another oral tradition of the region claims that this pillar is related to the <span class=\"popular emph\">katsik doring</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">bka&rsquo; gtsigs rdo ring</span> (pillar edict) of <span class=\"popular\">Zh&ouml;l</span><span class=\"scholar\">Zhol</span> in <span class=\"popular\">Lhasa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Lha sa</span>. A more elaborate oral tradition relates that the magical she goat, <span class=\"popular\">Ramo Gyamo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ra mo rgya mo</span> (Black She Goat with Brownish Facial Markings), was appointed o carry sand to fill in <span class=\"popular\">Oma Tso</span><span class=\"scholar\">&rsquo;O ma mtsho</span> (Milk Lake), in order to prepare for the construction of the <span class=\"popular\">Jokhang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Jo khang</span> temple in the center of <span class=\"popular\">Lhasa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Lha sa</span>.<a href=\"#n42\" name=\"nb42\" class=\"note\">42</a> While on her mission, <span class=\"popular\">Ramo Gyamo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ra mo rgya mo</span> was also on the lookout for a place suitable for the founding of the <span class=\"popular\">Ramoch&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ra mo che</span> temple. This she goat passed by the <span class=\"popular\">Domilang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo mi lang</span> valley and pillar, an important location, but it was determined not to have the qualities needed for the founding of a great Buddhist temple. This location was incomplete, like a monk without his robes (<span class=\"popular emph\">ch&ouml;g&ouml;</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">chos gos</span>). The location also fell under the influence of the inauspicious mountain, <span class=\"popular\">Nakgu</span><span class=\"scholar\">Nag gu</span> (Blackness), the residence of an evil spirit (<span class=\"popular\">dr&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">&rsquo;Dre</span>), rather than the auspicious<span class=\"popular\">Karru Lhatso</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dkar ru lha mtsho</span> (White Divine Lake) locale. Furthermore, the mountain, <span class=\"popular\">Langche</span><span class=\"scholar\">Glang che</span> (Great Elephant), to the north lacked a trunk and a saddle, and its spring was like a vase (<span class=\"popular emph\">bhumpa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">bum pa</span>) without a cloth lid. Finally, the nearby mountain, <span class=\"popular\">Langchung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Glang chung</span> (Lesser Elephant), lacked kidney fat. The she goat left her droppings at <span class=\"popular\">Karru Lhatso</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dkar ru lha mtsho</span>, causing a scrub willow forest to appear there. According to this well-developed legend, the <span class=\"popular\">Domilang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo mi lang</span> pillar was already erected by the early seventh century CE. </p> <h4 id=\"b2-1-70-4\">Site elements</h4> <p>The four-sided blue-gray igneous pillar is slightly inclined to the northwest (1.85 m [height] x 1 m [basal girth]). The top of the pillar narrows until it has a girth of only 50 cm. The southeast and northwest faces of <span class=\"popular\">Domilang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo mi lang</span> are somewhat broader than its other two sides. The pillar is surrounded by five cairns topped with pieces of milky quartz and a couple of plaques inscribed with the <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma &#7751;i</span> mantra, a shrine that is no longer maintained. The heads of goats and sheep are tied to the top one-third of the pillar. This is an apotropaic cult practice to protect the remaining animals of the herd from sickness. Butter and red ochre have also been applied to the pillar, a sign of its sacred status and the healing power it is supposed to possess. There are hree faint markings on the southeast face of the pillar, which look a little like Tibetan letters. The faint vestiges of a wall running east-west (15 m long) begins 14 m south of the pillar. On both ends it connects with even more obscure walls running north-south. Although no coherent fragments have survived, it could be determined hat these walls are generally aligned in the cardinal directions. A dark-colored metamorphic rock (10 cm to 35 cm long) was used in the construction of these walls. They may possibly represent the remains of a separate funerary enclosure. </p> <hr class=\"footnote-divider\"/> <h2>Notes</h2> <div class=\"footnote\"> <a name=\"n42\"/> <a href=\"#nb42\" class=\"note\"> [42] </a> This tale about the magical she goat was collected from <span class=\"popular\">Lozang Tenpa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Blo bzang bstan pa</span> (born in Fire Tiger Year, circa 1926), a former chief representative of the <span class=\"popular\">Namru</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gnam ru</span> <span class=\"popular emph\">dzongp&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rdzong dpon</span> (district head) under the old <span class=\"popular\">Lhasa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Lha sa</span> government and a member of the <span class=\"popular\">Nakchu</span><span class=\"scholar\">Nag chu</span> Political Consultative Committee under the Chinese Communists.

The longest vista is in the east, while the view to the west is hemmed in by a closely bound ridge. The errain is level, well drained and sandy. The site consists of a single pillar erected inside an enclosure. Although this monument has geographic and morphological traits associated with walled pillars, only ill-defined vestiges of the enclosure are still visible. It is reported that a Chinese military patrol camped at <span class=\"popular\">Domilang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo mi lang</span> in 1959 and removed stones from the enclosure. </p> <h4 id=\"b2-1-93-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>It is said by local sources that <span class=\"popular\">Domilang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo mi lang</span> was named for its resemblance to a standing person. Local <span class=\"popular emph\">drok pa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">&rsquo;brog pa</span> also report hat this site is associated with the ancient <span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span>.</p> <h4 id=\"b2-1-93-4\">Site elements</h4> <h5 id=\"b2-1-93-4-1\">Enclosure</h5> <p>Very little of the enclosure has endured to the present day. Tiny traces of its south wall run for nearly 5 m, beginning just east of the pillar. The few extant metamorphic (?) stones are around 20 cm in length and are level with the ground surface. These stones are uncut and blocky. There are also a few in situ stones comprising a 1-m long segment of the north wall. These two wall segments appear to be oriented east-west, suggesting that he entire enclosure was aligned in the cardinal directions. The distance between the north wall and south wall fragments is 3.8 m, indicating that this was a smaller example of this enclosure type. There is a double-course slab wall 4.2 m in length situated 6.2 m east of the pillar. This slab wall appears to be quite well centered between the north and south walls of the enclosure. Its relative position indicates that it constituted an interior structural feature of the enclosure. The slab wall is generally oriented east-west, but its course is not perfectly straight. Slabs (10 cm to 30 cm long) inserted into the ground edgewise make up the wall. The slabs project a maximum of 5 cm above the ground surface. Two different types of rock were selected for use as slabs. Some loose stones are scattered in and around the enclosure. </p> <h5 id=\"b2-1-93-4-2\">Pillar</h5> <p>The single pillar appears to stand near what was once the west wall of the enclosure. This pillar seems to have been well centered between the north and south walls of the enclosure. The irregularly shaped blue-gray metamorphic (?) menhir is 90 cm in height and has a basal girth of 1.3 m. The pillar is highly eroded, somewhat discolored, and is gently inclined towards the east. </p> <table cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\" class=\"navarrows\"> <tbody> <tr> <td class=\"leftcell\"> <a class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-left.gif\" title=\"Previous Section\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"midcell\"> <a class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-up.gif\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"rightcell\"> <a class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-right.gif\" title=\"Next Section\"/> </a> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div id=\"chap-id\">/bellezza2/b2-1-93/</div> <div style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\" class=\"jqmWindow\" id=\"chapRefWindow\"> <div class=\"closebtn\"> <a href=\"#\">Close</a> </div> <div style=\"height: 280px;\" class=\"conx-content\"> <h3>Note Citation for Page <span class=\"pgnm\"/> </h3> <p class=\"biblref\">John Vincent Bellezza, Antiquities of Zhang Zhung: A Comprehensive Inventory of Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Monuments on he Tibetan Upland (Charlottesville, VA 22904:Tibetan &amp; Himalayan Library, 2010), <span class=\"pgnm\"/>. </p> <h3>Bibliographic Citation</h3> <p>John Vincent Bellezza.
