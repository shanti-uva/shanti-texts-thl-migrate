They represent one of the earliest attempts by the Tibetan Empire to transform clan-based territory into state-based territory, or at the very least to officially ratify clan ownership of territory. This system probably started before the 7th century, though we only know of them during the 7th century when they were replaced by the \"horns\" and \"thousand-household district\" system.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e[1] See p.363-364 of the D.Phil.
