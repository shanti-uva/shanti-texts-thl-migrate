Pakmo Drupa was a hermetic figure who lived in a simple meditation hut. It appears that most likely his tradition spawned the greatest number of subdivisions precisely because of his hermetic tendencies, such that the lack of organization combined with his charisma spawned multiple movements in his wake.
