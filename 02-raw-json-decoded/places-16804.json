The site is situated at the foot of the ridge that encloses the south side of the valley. The terrain is rocky and moderately sloping. <span class=\"popular\">Gyamgya</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gyam rgya</span> consists of three funerary structures that are primarily constructed of a gray igneous rock. </p> <h4 id=\"b2-2-52-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>None was collected.</p> <h4 id=\"b2-2-52-4\">Site elements</h4> <h5 id=\"b2-2-52-4-1\">Funerary Structure FS1</h5> <p>Funerary structure FS1 (8 m x 7.5 m) is an enclosure so degraded that its identity is called into question.</p> <h5 id=\"b2-2-52-4-2\">Funerary Structure FS2</h5> <p>Funerary structure FS2 (4 m x 4 m) is a square terraced structure situated 21 m southeast of FS1 at the same elevation. Its walls are aligned to the slope gradient and not the cardinal directions. The forward wall of FS2 is 1 m in height and built in two tiers. The lower portion of the forward wall is set 60 cm outwards from the upper portion. The more substantial lower portion consists of a single course of large stones (50 cm to 80 cm long) and is around 40 cm in height. The rear wall is flush with the slope; the demarcation between them is now rather ambiguous. Goat and sheep horns have been placed on top of FS2. </p> <h5 id=\"b2-2-52-4-3\">Funerary Structure FS3</h5> <p>Funerary structure FS3 is situated 6.7 m southeast of FS2 at the same elevation. It appears to consist of a square base (5 m x 5.4 m), which is now heavily obscured by rubble. Upon this base sits an upper structure (2.9 m x 3 m) whose central portion is elevated an additional 70 cm. The rear wall of FS3 is flush with the slope. It appears that FS3 was a tiered structure; possibly it had non-funerary ceremonial identity. </p> <table cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\" class=\"navarrows\"> <tbody> <tr> <td class=\"leftcell\"> <a class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-left.gif\" title=\"Previous Section\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"midcell\"> <a class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-up.gif\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"rightcell\"> <a class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-right.gif\" title=\"Next Section\"/> </a> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div id=\"chap-id\">/bellezza2/b2-2-52/</div> <div style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\" class=\"jqmWindow\" id=\"chapRefWindow\"> <div class=\"closebtn\"> <a href=\"#\">Close</a> </div> <div style=\"height: 280px;\" class=\"conx-content\"> <h3>Note Citation for Page <span class=\"pgnm\"/> </h3> <p class=\"biblref\">John Vincent Bellezza, Antiquities of Zhang Zhung: A Comprehensive Inventory of Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Monuments on he Tibetan Upland (Charlottesville, VA 22904:Tibetan &amp; Himalayan Library, 2010), <span class=\"pgnm\"/>. </p> <h3>Bibliographic Citation</h3> <p>John Vincent Bellezza.
