The fragmentary foundations of the single structure are aligned in the cardinal directions, and are elevated about 1.5 m above the surrounding plain. The main foundation measures 13 m (north-south) x 10 m (east-west) and contains stones predominantly 70 cm to 1.2 m in length. On this foundation, a <span class=\"popular emph\">Ch&ouml;rten</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mchod rten</span> and wall with <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma &#7751;i</span> plaques were built with stones extracted from the ruins. Traces of wall-footings are also found 6 m east of the main foundation. A smaller building is said to have once stood here. The oral traditions associated with the site suggest that it has an ancient origin. Its local identification as a fortress is suspect, however, because it is not located on high, protected ground. </p> <h4 id=\"b1-2-30-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>According to villagers of <span class=\"popular\">Sok</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sog</span>, a six-sided building attributed to the ancient <span class=\"popular\">Sogpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sog po</span> (a Turco-Mongolian or Indo-European group) was founded at <span class=\"popular\">Sinmo Dzong</span><span class=\"scholar\">Srin mo rdzong</span>. The <span class=\"popular\">Sogpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sog po</span> are thought to have colonized the locale in the distant past. It is said that the ruins resembled those at <span class=\"popular\">Beltsa Gyangtrok</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bal tshwa gyang khrog</span> near <span class=\"popular\">Dargy&eacute; Ling</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dar rgyas gling</span>, <span class=\"popular\">Saga</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sa dga&rsquo;</span> county. Local elders report that this windowless edifice had an east-facing entrance around 1 m in height. The structure stood in a fairly good state of preservation until it was gradually demolished beginning in the Chinese Cultural Revolution. Elders report, however, that the edifice did not have a roof during their lifetimes. In the pre-modern period the walls of the so-called fortress were taller han the present day <span class=\"popular emph\">Ch&ouml;rten</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mchod rten </span> (they were probably around 4 m in height). The stones removed from the monument were used to build corrals around <span class=\"popular\">Sok</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sog</span>village. Some <span class=\"popular emph\">drok pa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">&rsquo;brog pa</span> claim that a stone with an inscription somewhat resembling Chinese was found in the foundation of the structure. According to <span class=\"popular\">Arus Menla</span><span class=\"scholar\">A rus sman bla</span> (born circa 1920), a recognized expert on local history, <span class=\"popular\">Sinmo Dzong</span><span class=\"scholar\">Srin mo rdzong</span> was founded around the same time as <span class=\"popular\">Beltsa Gyangtrok</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bal tshwa gyang khrog</span> (there are very impressive ruins at this site).<a href=\"#n87\" name=\"nb87\" class=\"note\">87</a> He believes that it was in use until the <span class=\"popular\">Lhasa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Lha sa</span> government period (mid-17th century to 1959 CE), and was once occupied by a <span class=\"popular emph\">Singpa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">sing pa</span> (invaders from the northwest Subcontinent) army. </p> <p>According to local folklore, seven <span class=\"popular\">sinmo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Srin mo</span> (a man-eating demoness) sisters once occupied the site. One night the <span class=\"popular\">sinmo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Srin mo</span> decided to build themselves a house (<span class=\"popular\">sinmo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Srin mo</span> only work at night, say local elders). These evil beings had already built the foundation and walls when <span class=\"popular\">Guru Rinpoch&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ru rin po che</span>, the 8th century CE <span class=\"emph\">VajrayAna</span> hero, arrived to stop them. Had the <span class=\"popular\">sinmo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Srin mo</span> <span class=\"emph\"> </span>been able to complete their dwelling it would have had very deleterious consequences for the entire countryside. <span class=\"popular\">Guru Rinpoch&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ru rin po che</span> magically made the sun appear early. The sunrays caught the <span class=\"popular\">sinmo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Srin mo</span> unaware and they perished in the light of the day. <span class=\"popular\">Guru Rinpoch&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ru rin po che</span> left his hat (<span class=\"popular emph\">wuzha</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">dbu zhwa</span>) behind in order to subdue the locale. His hat became the supporting mountain (<span class=\"popular emph\">Gyapri</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rgyab ri</span>) of <span class=\"popular\">Sok</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sog</span>village known as <span class=\"popular\">Sokgyap Ri</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sog rgyab ri</span>. </p> <h4 id=\"b1-2-30-4\">Affiliated sites</h4> <h5 id=\"b1-2-30-4-1\">Tomb</h5> <p>Approximately 200 m southwest of <span class=\"popular\">Sinmo Dzong</span><span class=\"scholar\">Srin mo rdzong</span> there are the vestiges of an enclosure that may have measured around 7 m x 7 m. All that is left are two stones protruding about 30 cm above the surface. Reportedly, when local residents dismantled this enclosure several years ago the bones of at least two humans were unearthed. These skeletal remains are said to have represented an adult and juvenile. Minute traces of what appear to be bleached human bones are found in the vicinity. </p> <h5 id=\"b1-2-30-4-2\">Fortifications</h5> <p>On the lower summit of <span class=\"popular\">Sokgyap Ri</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sog rgyab ri</span> (4830 m) there are two small superficial structures that local sources say are ancient fortifications (<span class=\"popular emph\">makra</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">dmag ra</span>). Called <span class=\"popular\">Guru Wuzha Makra</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ru dbu zhwa dmag ra</span>, these minor structures were built on level, rocky ground. They have been reduced to 60 cm or less in height and measure approximately 2 m x 2.5 m. Stones up to 90 cm in length went into the construction of these so-called <span class=\"popular emph\">makra</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">dmag ra</span>. </p> <hr class=\"footnote-divider\"/> <h2>Notes</h2> <div class=\"footnote\"> <a name=\"n87\"/> <a href=\"#nb87\" class=\"note\"> [87] </a> According to <span class=\"popular\">Lopp&ouml;n Tendzin Namdak</span><span class=\"scholar\">Slob dpon bstan &rsquo;dzin rnam dag</span> (in personal communication), this location is probably the same as <span class=\"popular\">Takts&eacute; Jani</span><span class=\"scholar\">Stag rtse bya ni</span>, which is associated with the <span class=\"popular\">Yangel</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ya ngal</span> clan of <span class=\"popular emph\">shen</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">gshen</span> practitioners. <span class=\"popular\">Yangel Yangt&ouml;n Chenpo Sherap Gyeltsen</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ya ngal yang ston chen po shes rab rgyal mtshan</span> is recorded as migrating from <span class=\"popular\">takts&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Stag rtse</span> to <span class=\"popular\">Lowo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Glo bo</span> in the 12th century CE (Guntram Hazod, &ldquo;The Yul Lha Gsol of Mtsho Yul.
