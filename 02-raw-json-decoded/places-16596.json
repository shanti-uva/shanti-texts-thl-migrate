The surrounding terrain is sandy and rocky but arable lands are also found in fairly close proximity. The equal degradation of the structures and the uniform wall types suggest that the two buildings formed an integral installation. In total, the structures contain about 24 rooms as well as three latrines. This domestic arrangement might point to the tenancy of two dozen or more people at the site. The existence of this religious complex is probably attributable to the extensive agricultural base that was once found in the \u003cspan class=\"popular\"\u003eDech\u0026ouml;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"scholar\"\u003eSde chos\u003c/span\u003e valley (see A-85). The old agrarian economy likely generated the resources necessary for the maintenance of this fairly large nucleus of habitation. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe floor level of the two buildings is situated entirely above ground. The two edifices were constructed with both all-stone and timber roofs. These structures therefore represent an unusual hybrid type of residential monument. As with other all-stone structures, \u003cspan class=\"popular\"\u003eDech\u0026ouml; G\u0026ouml;npa\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"scholar\"\u003eSde chos dgon pa\u003c/span\u003e does not have large central halls or regularly shaped and arranged rooms. Exterior walls and partitions are largely intact and commonly reach 2 m in height. Much of the mud-mortar used in the 45-cm- to 60-cm-thick random-work walls is extant. The granite blocks used in construction are primarily 20 cm to 50 cm in length. Although Buddhist monuments are located at the site, it is not at all clear who founded \u003cspan class=\"popular\"\u003eDech\u0026ouml; G\u0026ouml;npa\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"scholar\"\u003eSde chos dgon pa\u003c/span\u003e. Either the Bonpo or Buddhists could have established this archaic facility. The early inhabitants of Upper Tibet, however, did not usually favor valley bottom sites and a fully above-ground aspect for the construction of their \u003cspan class=\"popular emph\"\u003esekhang\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"scholar emph\"\u003egsas khang\u003c/span\u003e.

The perimeter of this structure measures approximately 70 m. In addition, there is a forward or east courtyard that measures 10 m (north-south) x 5 m (east-west). The walls enclosing this open space have crumbled o their foundations. There appear to have been three east entrances to the south edifice. On the exterior south side of the south edifice there is a 50-cm high parapet wall, adding significantly to the building\u0026rsquo;s elevation.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe 60-m wide north entrance is positioned outside the courtyard and accesses a north wing that seems to have constituted five rooms. None of the internal entrances between these rooms have survived in the fragmentary wall partitions. The northeast room (2.2 m x 2.8 m) of the north wing has a niche in the north wall. An L-shaped room measures 3 m x 3 m on its long sides. The other three rooms of the north wing are each around 8 m\u0026sup2;. None of the roof has persisted in the north wing, but evidence from other parts of the south edifice suggests that it was constructed with both stone and timber roofing materials.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe entrance to the central wing of the south edifice was obliterated along with the wall in which it was built. The central entrance was situated inside the courtyard. The central wing of the facility apparently had six rooms. Among the rooms in this portion of the structure is a latrine in the southeast corner of the building. It has a hole in the floor that is conveyed to a privy pit with an east-facing opening at the base of he exterior wall. The largest room in the central wing is the central north room (5 m x 3.5 m). This relatively large room with its long straight walls must have been built with a timber roof. The other five rooms are significantly smaller and may have had stone roofs. There is a niche in a wall of the northwest room and one in he southwest room. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe south entrance gains entry to the south wing of the building with its seven small rooms and latrine. The irregularly-shaped rear room has corbels attached to the tops of the walls, indicating that a stone integument covered them. The largest room in the south wing is the central north specimen (2.7 m x 3.2 m). There are two niches in the north wall of this room. From the central north room there is an entranceway (1 m x 50 cm) to the west compartment and an entranceway (1.1 m x 50 cm) to the south compartment (situated in the southwest corner of the south edifice). There are two niches and a recess (1 m x 50 cm) in the west compartment. Many of the roof corbels in the tiny west room are in situ. The maximum floor-to-ceiling height of the west room is 1.8 m. Accounting for the corbels, bridging stones and sheathing slabs, the total height of the west room must have been around 2.2 m. The stone roof in the south room (1.8 m x 1.5 m) is partly intact. The floor-to-ceiling height of this room is around 1.6 m. There was also a central south room as well as three forward rooms in the south wing of the south edifice. \u003c/p\u003e \u003ch5 id=\"b1-2-21-4-2\"\u003eNorth edifice \u003c/h5\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe north edifice (4470 m) is situated 75 m northwest of the south edifice, at slightly higher elevation. It measures 8.3 m (east wall) x 11 m (south wall) x 9.7 m (west wall) x 10.4 m (north wall). This building is generally aligned in the cardinal directions. Although none of the roof is extant in the north edifice, the walls are much straighter than the south edifice, indicating that it was largely or entirely constructed with a imber roof. Many of the walls still reach 1.5 to 2 m in height. The north edifice contains five rooms: northwest (3.5 m x 2.7 m), southwest (3 m x 3.1 m), northeast (2 m x 2.6 m), southeast (2.7 m x 2.5 m), central (6.5 m x 3.6 m), as well as a small entrance vestibule. The latrine is accessed from the southwest room. The latrine comprises a small extension of the main body of the structure. The latrine privy pit and its exterior wall opening are still intact. There is also a small courtyard on the east side of the building. Inside the courtyard there is a broken stone mortar formed from a hollowed boulder. \u003c/p\u003e \u003ch5 id=\"b1-2-21-4-3\"\u003esde chos shrine\u003c/h5\u003e \u003cp\u003eTwo meters north of the south edifice there is a rectangular masonry structure (5.6 m x 1.9 x 1.3 m).
