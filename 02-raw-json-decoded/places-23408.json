Name of the hermitage</h3> <p>dPal ri khud yang dben bde chen sgang </p> <h3 id=\"b4-5-2\">2. Location </h3> <p>After driving 480 kilometres from Shigatse, one reaches Mount Mu la, whence a further drive of thirty kilometres takes one to La phu village. The hermitage is located near the village. Travellers on foot usually stay one night in Tingri, then reach the hermitage early the next day.</p> <h3 id=\"b4-5-3\">3. History </h3> <p>bDe chen sgang was originally a hermitage established by the recluse sPa ston dPal mchog (b.1040) of the sacred Bonpo family known as sPa, whose seat was found in La phug village. Later, the hermitage was extended into a monastery by sPa dPal ldan bzang po and then became an important centre of learning for Bonpo followers in Western Tibet. The monastery produced several monk-scholars: for example, Tre ston rGyal mtshan dpal who had compiled a type of encyclopedia, in the monastery, of Bon and Buddhist doctrines, entitled Bon <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">sgo gsal byed</span> and the well-known historian, sPa bsTan rgyal bzang po, who wrote several works in the same place in the 15th century. Later, a branch of the sPa family migrated to Ye tha, in the Hor region, northern Tibet, where it became prosperous, and as a result the monastery at La phug declined and became once again a hermitage. It is still a small hermitage where a few married religious practitioners (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">ser khyim</span>) reside.</p> <h3 id=\"b4-5-4\">4.

Annual rituals</h3> <p>The hermitage cannot afford to hold any religious assemblies and is not expected to do so.</p> <p>Apart from going out to recite scriptures and prayers, the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">ser khyim</span> live with their families most of the time.</p> <h3 id=\"b4-5-9\">10.
