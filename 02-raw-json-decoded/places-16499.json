It is one of a chain of archaic strongholds occupying lofty locations above the arable <span class=\"popular\">Gar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sgar</span> valley.<a href=\"#n35\" name=\"nb35\" class=\"note\">35</a> The castle commands excellent views of the <span class=\"popular\">Gar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sgar</span> valley, especially to the north and east, and enjoys a defensibly tenable position. Castle Valley Ruined Castle is found above the right side of the <span class=\"popular\">Kharlung Chu</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mkhar lung chu</span>, in proximity o where it debouches into the main valley. This was an extensive complex composed of a cluster of small buildings built with cobble walls. The dispersion blankets an area of 190 m along the axis of the hill (north-south) by 13.5 m to 30 m (east-west). A count of wall footings indicates that this site consisted of around 100 rooms and/or buildings. Most structures have been reduced to their foundations or low-lying wall fragments. The high elevation of this site and style of construction, whereby tiny rooms predominate, are archaic cultural horizon situational and morphological traits. </p> <h4 id=\"b1-1-19-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p> Castle Valley Ruined Castle is said by local sources to be an ancient <span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span> citadel.</p> <h4 id=\"b1-1-19-4\">Site elements</h4> <h5 id=\"b1-1-19-4-1\">Castle</h5> <p>The south end (13.5 m wide) and the north end (19 m wide) are the narrowest parts of the ridge-spur. Most of he remaining sections of the summit are around 30 m wide. Ruined buildings are dispersed across the summit. Structures were made with random-work cobble-stones. Walls must have been lightly mortared, however, no mortar remains in the seams. Walls are between 50 cm to 80 cm in thickness, but nothing above 1.5 m in height has survived, so an assessment of upper wall design is not possible. It could not be judged whether the walls were possibly constructed with adobe blocks supporting fixed roofs or alternatively, if they were low elevation stone structures with semi-permanent roofs made of materials such as animal hides or yak hair. On the east rim of the summit there was an interconnected line of buildings. These mostly had very small rooms (4 m&sup2;) but more commodious specimens (12 m&sup2;) are also present. On the higher west edge of the hill, which overlooks a defile, here is a sparser line of structures. The slightly inclined summit is dominated by slopes around 10 m in height interspersed between the east and west rims of the formation. These steeply inclined slopes tend to be devoid of buildings. What appears to have been the largest single structure at the site is found on the south side of summit (6 m x 11 m). Other ruins in this area have exterior dimensions of around 5 m x 6 m. </p> <p>On the east side of the Castle Valley Ruined Castle hill, around 10 m below the summit, the slope was cut to create a level walkway averaging 3 m in width. North, or down slope, of the fortress there is a superficial funerary-like structure (3 m x 3 m), which protrudes 70 cm above he ground. </p> <h4 id=\"b1-1-19-5\">Affiliated sites</h4> <h5 id=\"b1-1-19-5-1\">Old Castle Valley (<span class=\"popular\">Kharlung</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mkhar lung</span>) village </h5> <p>The old Castle Valley (<span class=\"popular\">Kharlung</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mkhar lung</span>) village site (32&deg; 02.2&#900; N. lat. / 80&deg; 01.9&#900; E. long. / 4370 m) is located some 5 km north of Castle Valley Ruined Castle, outside the range of its protective embrace. Covering an area of more than 15,000 m&sup2;, this sizable habitation was founded on the foot of a hill bounding the west side of the <span class=\"popular\">Gar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sgar</span> valley. Hundreds of people must have once resided here in a dense agglomeration of houses. Unlike the nearby contemporary village of Castle Valley, with its five households, the height of old Castle Valley affords it protection from floods, which have been particularly severe in the last decade. According to local residents, old Castle Valley is connected to a Tibetan ruler who ruled the region before the <span class=\"popular\">Namrup&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gnam ru dpon</span> of the <span class=\"popular emph\">Ganden Podrang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">dga' ldan pho brang</span> period (1660-1959 CE). The settlement, however, is also associated with the <span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span>, which may suggest that its foundations date to the prehistoric epoch or early historic period. It is certainly possible hat important magnets of sedentary settlement in the moist and fertile <span class=\"popular\">Gar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sgar</span> valley enjoyed a very long period of tenure.</p> <p>The buildings of the old settlement have been largely leveled and only fragmentary wall footings, wall segments, pits, and rocky mounds are left. In recent years, some of the stones have been used to build corrals on the site. At the upper end of the village there are a few adobe wall segments heralding the location of a Buddhist temple, which included a chapel called <span class=\"popular\">Kharlung G&ouml;nkhang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mkhar lung mgon khang</span>. This protector chapel was destroyed long before living memory. It is reported that the deities <span class=\"popular\">Penden Lhamo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dpal ldan lha mo</span> and <span class=\"popular\">G&ouml;npo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mgon po</span> were worshipped here. In the vicinity are several ruined a type of shrine. Approximately 1 km southwest of the village is a ruined residential structure said to have been the residence of a district headman. Agricultural lands run right up to his ruined homestead. This once substantial building (19 m x 23 m) contained at least eight large rooms. It was primarily constructed of mud-mortared cobble walls, 50 cm to 80 cm in thickness. Wall fragments up to 2.5 m in height have survived. Most walls are partially intact, thus the structure is in far better condition than those in old Castle Valley village. In a central wall partition (runs north-south) there is a window (30 cm x 60 cm) whose lintel of tamarisk rounds is intact. Immediately to he south is a less well-preserved building (6 m x 14 m), said to have been a kitchen (<span class=\"popular emph\">taptsang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">thab shang</span>). South of the headman&rsquo;s homestead are highly eroded plaques with carved inscriptions of the <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma &#7751;i</span> mantra in <span class=\"popular emph\">lentsa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">lan tsha</span> script. This style of inscribed stone appears to have been produced in the period of the early <span class=\"popular\">Ngari Korsum</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mnga' ris skor gsum</span> kings (roughly late 10th to 13th century CE). The ruins of the headmen&rsquo;s estate have been partially converted into a livestock pen (corral (<span class=\"popular emph\">lhara</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">lhas ra</span>)) and tent camp (<span class=\"popular emph\">nangra</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">nang ra</span>). </p> <h5 id=\"b1-1-19-5-2\">Old <span class=\"popular\">Malh&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ma lhas</span> village </h5> <p>Like old Castle Valley village, old <span class=\"popular\">Malh&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ma lhas</span> village is situated at the foot of the <span class=\"popular\">Ayi La</span><span class=\"scholar\">A yi la</span> range, on a broad low-lying ridge-top (32&deg; 04.7&#900; N. lat. / 79&deg; 59.3&#900; E. long. / 4340 m). In contrast, new ma lhas village is located in the rather marshy valley bottom, and only supports around one dozen households. The precedent for permanent settlement in the valley bottom extends back to at least the late 17th century CE, and the establishment of <span class=\"popular\">Ganden Tsewang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dga' ldan tshe dbang</span>&rsquo;s <span class=\"popular\">Ngari</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mnga' ris</span> headquarters near he <span class=\"popular\">Gar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sgar</span> river. Old <span class=\"popular\">Malh&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ma lhas</span> covers an area of approximately 5000 m&sup2;, and contains a dense collection of fragmentary mud-mortared cobble footings and wall segments. There is a number of ruined <span class=\"popular emph\">ch&ouml; ten</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mchod rten </span>on the site. On the north or higher end of he ruined village there are the remains of a Buddhist temple, where the local territorial deity mes pha bong (Ancestor Boulder) is supposed to have been propitiated. The much degraded cobble and adobe block walls of the temple reach a maximum height of 2 m. The relative position of he Buddhist temple, paralleling the placement of the temple in old Castle Valley, supports a chronological connection between the two settlements, as attested in the oral tradition. </p> <h5 id=\"b1-1-19-5-3\">sGar agriculture</h5> <p>The origin of farming in Castle Valley and <span class=\"popular\">Malh&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ma lhas</span> is ascribed to the <span class=\"popular\">Kel M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Skal mon</span>, an ethnic group that may have formed part of the aboriginal substrate of western Tibet. By the sheer amount of defunct farm fields attributed to the ancient <span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span>, it would appear that agricultural production in <span class=\"popular\">Gar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sgar</span> was at its zenith in the prehistoric epoch. Grain output in sgar may have once been sufficient o feed several thousand people, engaging hundreds of farmers. Nowadays, in stark contrast, a handful of farmers in each village struggle to produce any barley at all. The subsistence economic focus has shifted to animal husbandry. It appears from anecdotal evidence that the agrarian way of life has been waning for centuries. The evidence presented by the old Buddhist villages of Castle Valley and <span class=\"popular\">Malh&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ma lhas</span> indicates that agriculture was still an important occupation during the period of the <span class=\"popular\">Ngari</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mnga' ris</span> kings, but it probably was already in a state of decline. </p> <p>Modern <span class=\"popular\">Malh&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ma lhas</span> and Castle Valley still have extensive arable lands but only a small fraction is exploited in any given year. This is due to a lack of manpower and a chronic shortage of water. A water shortfall also affects other agrarian communities in <span class=\"popular\">Gar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sgar</span> such as <span class=\"popular\">Tarchang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Thar-lcang</span>, <span class=\"popular\">Namru</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gnam ru</span> and Upper Fields (<span class=\"popular\">Zhing Khagong</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">zhing ka gong</span>). In recent years, flash floods and an explosion in the rabbit population have had a detrimental impact on farming as well. Floods in the last decade have destroyed more than en km&sup2; of farmland and pastureland in the <span class=\"popular\">Gar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sgar</span> valley, eliminating the essential land-base of scores of families. In greater Castle Valley alone, 35 families lost their winter grazing grounds in the devastating floods of 1999. </p> <hr class=\"footnote-divider\"/> <h2>Notes</h2> <div class=\"footnote\"> <a name=\"n35\"/> <a href=\"#nb35\" class=\"note\"> [35] </a> Although it is commonly stated that <span class=\"popular\">Gar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sgar</span> (Military Encampment) received its name from the military headquarters established here by <span class=\"popular\">Ganden Tsewang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dga' ldan tshe dbang</span> (fl. 1680) in the late 17th century CE, the origin of this toponym may also have something to do with the eight ancient (<span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span>) fortresses (A-22, A-23, A-41, A-42, A-43, A-44, A-66, A-67) that encircle the valley. </div> <table cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\" class=\"navarrows\"> <tbody> <tr> <td class=\"leftcell\"> <a class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-left.gif\" title=\"Previous Section\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"midcell\"> <a class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-up.gif\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"rightcell\"> <a class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-right.gif\" title=\"Next Section\"/> </a> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div id=\"chap-id\">/bellezza/b1-1-19/</div> <div style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\" class=\"jqmWindow\" id=\"chapRefWindow\"> <div class=\"closebtn\"> <a href=\"#\">Close</a> </div> <div style=\"height: 280px;\" class=\"conx-content\"> <h3>Note Citation for Page <span class=\"pgnm\"/> </h3> <p class=\"biblref\">John Vincent Bellezza, Antiquities of Zhang Zhung: A Comprehensive Inventory of Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Monuments on he Tibetan Upland (Charlottesville, VA 22904:Tibetan &amp; Himalayan Library, 2010), <span class=\"pgnm\"/>. </p> <h3>Bibliographic Citation</h3> <p>John Vincent Bellezza.
