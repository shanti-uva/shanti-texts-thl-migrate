Name </h4> <p>gTso tshang Monastery&rsquo;s full name is gSang sngags smin grol dar rgyas gling. gTso is the family name of gTso &rsquo;phags Zla ba rgyal mtshan whose descendents founded the three monasteries -Ze kha, Bya brang and gSer gzhong- that constitute gTso tshang. Since the monastery is presently located in Legs lung village, it is also known as Legs lung Monastery. In the local dialect, the name of the village used to be La lo, but since no one no longer knows the original meaning of the term, the monastery&rsquo;s name was recently changed to Legs lung, &ldquo;Good Valley&rdquo;, because of the term&rsquo;s positive connotation.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-1-3-2\">2. Location</h4> <p>In the early nineteen-eighties, the authorities granted permission to rebuild Ze kha, Bya brang and gSer gzhong monasteries together as one monastery at the site of Bya brang Monastery in Bya brang village, where the main assembly hall (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">&rsquo;du khang</span>) had escaped destruction. However, since there was no longer enough land there to rebuild all three monasteries, Legs lung village was chosen as a new site. The site is located in Drongtsa (&rsquo;Brong tsha) valley, 2 km east of the The bo county seat. The mountain behind the monastery (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">rgyab ri</span>) is part of the sTag sgang range. The monastery, nestled in the mountain, is situated on the north bank of the eastward flowing &rsquo;Brug chu river and faces south (latitude: 34&deg;02&rsquo;93&rdquo;N, longitude: 103&deg;15&rsquo;22&rdquo;E).</p> <p>The original site of Ze kha monastery (latitude: 34&deg;02&rsquo;41&rdquo;N, longitude: 103&deg;14&rsquo;67&rdquo;E) is located 1 km northeast.</p> <p>The original site of Bya brang Monastery is located 2 km east of county town on the opposite river bank (latitude: 34&deg;02&rsquo;27&rdquo;N, longitude: 103&deg;15&rsquo;35&rdquo;E).</p> <p>The original site of gSer gzhong Monastery (latitude: 34&deg;35&rsquo;45&rdquo;N, longitude: 103&deg;30&rsquo;27&rdquo;E) is located 5 km east of county town on the north bank of the river.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-1-3-3\">3. History</h4> <p>According to oral tradition, the three brothers and great Bonpo masters Do &rsquo;phags chen mo, sKyang &rsquo;phags Nyi ma rgyal mtshan and gTso &rsquo;phags Zla ba rgyal mtshan came to Amdo to spread the Bon doctrine. They &ldquo;opened&rdquo; many hermitages (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">ri khrod</span>), some of which later became monasteries (for instance, sNang zhig Monastery No. 180, one of the largest Bonpo monasteries in Tibet, was originally a hermitage founded by Do &rsquo;phags chen mo). The three masters played a key role in the first spread of Bon in Amdo. There are descendents of gTso still living in The bo, Khri ka, Shar khog (=Zung chu) and rGan rgya in Amdo. Kyang za Yig rtsis ma, the mother of the three masters, also a fervent Bonpo, established her main residence at a site known as dGu skyang. gTso &rsquo;phags Zla ba rgyal mtshan is believed to have travelled extensively throughout the area, actively spreading the Bon religion. Although he founded only a number of sacred sites (and no monastery), he made a profound impression on the local culture and traditions. One of his mother&rsquo;s sacred sites and his main ritual and cremation sites are located at Chu gter rdzong, on Brag dkar bya rgod, a sacred mountain (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">gnas ri</span>) in Amdo. The first Bonpo monasteries were founded much later (only four to five generations ago) by gTso &rsquo;phags&rsquo;s descendents. At present the remaining known descendents of gTso &rsquo;phags live in the three villages that are financing the reconstruction of the three monasteries. Five of the families live in Ra nang village which is responsible for Ze kha Monastery, four in Bya brang village which is responsible for Bya brang Monastery, and two in gSer gzhong village which is responsible for gSer gzhong Monastery. There is no doubt that the &rsquo;Phags pa rnams gsum were lay people and that their religious tradition was permeated by indigenous customs and beliefs. However, the monasteries - which emerged much later - seem to have been strongly influenced by Buddhism.</p> <p>Since gTso tshang Monastery in fact comprises three monasteries - Ze kha, Bya brang, and gSer gzhong - it is important to mention here the information concerning their respective historical backgrounds.</p> <h5 id=\"b6-1-3-3-1\"> <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">Ze kha</span> </h5> <p>The date of Ze kha Monastery&rsquo;s foundation and the identity of its founder remain obscure; even A skal, the only surviving monk who has some knowledge on the history of gTso tshang and who wrote the only historical account of the monastery (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">TGLG</span>) is uncertain. The first master of Ze kha Monastery, Shar ba khri skyang, was born in sTod mtsho &rsquo;phel into one of the three Khri skyang villages of Zung chu County in rNga ba Prefecture; the second master was born in rGya myi ya ru (the exact location of which remains unknown). The third master was born in En &rsquo;dzin mtsho &rsquo;dus. During his lifetime the monastery&rsquo;s assembly hall was destroyed by fire and rebuilt. He travelled to Central Tibet and Khams. He was renowned as a saint, and was believed to be endowed with miraculous powers (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">grub rtags</span>); He is said to have founded the monastery&rsquo;s <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">&rsquo;cham</span> (monastic dance). The fourth master remains unidentified. The fifth, Bla ma skyabs, was born in lDong ba village of Brag sgom ba; his father was called A dam and his mother Klu mo. He broke his religious vows, so three influential monks of Ze kha - Dran pa skyabs, bSod nams dar rgyas and A rdo - invited Tshul khrims rgyal mtshan, a descendent of Do &rsquo;phags chen po, then aged five, from rNga khog to take his place in 1930. However, the new incumbent also broke his vows when he turned twenty-five, and was replaced by his brother Bon slebs Nam mkha&rsquo; bstan &rsquo;dzin, the present master of gTso tshang Monastery. Before 1958, Ze kha Monastery comprised a two storey assembly hall with five rooms on each floor, a common house (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">spyi khang</span>) with nine rooms and a two-storey building with five rooms called rNga sgra khang. According to oral tradition, the monastery was built on the site of an ancient Chinese Han fort.</p> <h5 id=\"b6-1-3-3-2\"> <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">Bya brang</span> </h5> <p>Although the real name of Bya brang Monastery&rsquo;s first lama remains unknown, he was locally known as gSer so can and was born in dGu skyang. According to oral tradition, he left dGu skyang with a retinue in search of an auspicious place to build a monastery. Disappointed by the first two sites where he expected to receive some favourable omen, he continued his search. As he was passing through a place called Nags &rsquo;bul beyond Tsha bzo mountain, he came upon a dead body which turned out to be that of the son of the A bze village chief who had been killed by a gang of robbers. He covered up the corpse, left his favourite dog behind to guard the corpse, and went to look for the deceased man&rsquo;s father. He eventually met the chief and his entourage who were looking for the son. The chief, moved by the Lama&rsquo;s solicitude for his dead son, requested him to become his spiritual master and offered him land on which to build the monastery, as well as fields and an estate to support it. The chosen site was known as Bya brang (&ldquo;Bird&rsquo;s chest&rdquo;) because of its garuda-like shape. gSer so can accepted the offer and thus Bya brang Monastery was built. His successor and incarnation was born in Mar sgur village not far from the monastery. Not much is known about the third incarnation except that he too was born in Mar sgur. However there are many fantastical tales relating his miraculous deeds circulating among the local Bonpo community. The fourth incarnation was born in En &rsquo;dzi&rsquo;i snya bza&rsquo;. The fifth was born in 1918, and his father was Klu &rsquo;bum bsod nams. He studied under Hor btsun bsTan &rsquo;dzin blo gros and obtained the Rab &rsquo;byams pa degree at gYung drung gling Monastery (No.2), and thus acquired a reputation as a learned lama. He built a new assembly hall. He died in 1958 at gYung drung gling. Before 1958, the monastery comprised a new assembly hall built of wood with five rooms on each floor, and a two-storey common house (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">spyi khang</span>) with five rooms on each floor, likewise built of wood.</p> <h5 id=\"b6-1-3-3-3\"> <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">gSer gzhong </span> </h5> <p>The first master of gSer gzhong Monastery, a descendent of gTso &rsquo;phags called Thor cog can, arrived from Dwang ra in the North to look for a place to build a monastery. He stopped at the site of gSer gzhong one night to rest and dreamt that a fox had stolen one of his boots, thus preventing him from travelling further. However, he found the fox&rsquo;s den with his boot inside. Thor cog can took this as a favourable omen and decided to build the monastery there. Its construction was financed by A nag dbang chen and gShen tsha glang thar. </p> <p>Thor cog can&rsquo;s reincarnation was born in sTag ri snya nang. The following incarnation and third lama of the monastery was born in En &rsquo;dzi&rsquo;i nyin ri. The fourth, Shes rab bstan &rsquo;dzin was born at sGang ri kha in 1907 and was enthroned at the age of six. He studied under Kun bzang tshang from sNang zhig in The bo and later went himself to sNang zhig to further his studies. He also travelled to central Tibet with an entourage. On the way, at Sog sde in Nag chu kha, he subdued a demon, a feat which earned him considerable fame and popularity. After spending three years at gYung drung gling and seven years at Grwa sa &rsquo;og ma i.e. sTag rtse ri khrod in Kong po to study and collect funds for the monasteries, he returned to The bo where he died in 1954 at the age of forty-seven. </p> <p>Another incarnation of the same lama was born almost at the same time, in 1916. His father was named Klu &rsquo;bum and his mother gNam sman &rsquo;tsho. He was enthroned at the age of twelve and his appointed tutor (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">yongs &rsquo;dzin</span>) was Tshe dbang shes rab. He left the monastery at a young age to search for his own spiritual teacher and whom he found in the person of bSe ba drung ram pa Shes rab phun tshogs at sKyang tshang Monastery (No. 202). He studied and practised assiduously for many years until his master&rsquo;s death, after which he returned to The bo where he spent four years at bDe gsal ri khrod, a hermitage he had founded. He then travelled to Central Tibet with two students via rKyang phyag. There is a record of all the Bonpo and Buddhist monasteries and sacred sites of Amdo, Khams, gTsang, dBus, Nag chu kha, mNga&rsquo; ris which he visited on his way. He also studied under Shar rdza bKra shis rgyal mtshan for two years. While in Central Tibet, he made a three-year retreat to practise the secret Ma rgyud tantra in a cave at lHa ri gyang tho where King dMu khri btsan po is said to have practised the sPyi spungs tantra of the Bon religion. A message from his monastery informing him of a disaster and requesting him to return drew him from his retreat. Back in The bo he chose to stay at the hermitage which he had recently established and not at his residence in the monastery. He became renowned throughout the area as an outstanding lama. He died in 1958 in Cone. </p> <p>In addition to the above-mentioned lamas of the main lineage, there are many other famous masters and practitioners whose stories are well known by the local population. Before 1958, the monastery comprised a three-storey assembly hall with seven rooms on each floor, a three-room sgrub khang and a five-room <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">spyi khang</span>, all built of wood.</p> <p>In the early nineteen-eighties, the elder monks from all three monasteries gathered to discuss how to rebuild the three monasteries together (permission was granted for only one monastery). They sought the advice of Bon slebs Nam mkha&rsquo; bstan &rsquo;dzin, the head lama of Ze kha at the time, and requested him to supervise the reconstruction of gTso tshang Monastery. The new assembly hall has twelve pillars. The most sacred objects within are a statue of sTon pa gShen rab which was discovered by dBal khyung sMon lam rgyal mtshan at gNas chen gSang ba yang rdzong, and brought to the monastery by Bon lsebs Nam mkha&rsquo; bstan &rsquo;dzin.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-1-3-4\">4.

Current number of monks</h4> <p>There are thirty-three monks and novices in gTso tshang Monastery.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-1-3-6\">6. Current education</h4> <p>At first A skal only taught the young monks reading and reciting. Later he began to teach a little grammar from texts such as the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">Sum bcu pa</span> and <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">rTags &rsquo;jug</span>. In 1996, Bon slebs Nam mkha&rsquo; bstan &rsquo;dzin sent sTag tsha Kun grol from rTogs ldan Monastery (No.178) to gTso tshang to be the head of a meditation college, to teach Tibetan, Bonpo theory and practice to all the monks, and to guide the three-year meditation retreat (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">lo gsum</span>) following the tradition (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">phyag len</span>) of rTogs ldan Monastery.

Local community </h4> <p>In the past the communities of three monasteries were organized, following the traditional Tibetan military system, into three units (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">dmag ru</span>), which, in the past, functioned as military divisions during critical times and which were stationed in open valleys: Nyin pa unit comprising Ra nang, Yang le, rDza ri, Kha lung, Lag lab, Gyi rong, lDong bzo and A ro, the manor villages of Ze kha Monastery; Srib pa unit comprising mDa&rsquo; lung, Yar sgur, Mar sgur, Bya brang, dPa&rsquo; brgya, sBas skyes, sNgo sngo and Nges sa, the manor villages of Bya brang Monastery (since the Bonpo monastery in Kha ba&rsquo;i klong was a branch monastery of Bya brang, its villages, as well as half of Kha ba, Shug steng kha and Ri bo sgang also belonged to Bya brang Monastery); sMad ma khag gsum unit comprising Chag sgo, Nyin lung kha, Shing &rsquo;bras, gSer gzhong, Ci nges nang, Kha nang, sGur mgo, Ban chung (no mention in <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">KBTL</span>), Nyin srib, and gSer gzhong Monastery&rsquo;s villages.

Mount Brag nag behind Ho ri is the abode of the local deity Brag nag. The mountain range to the east of Ze kha is called sTag sgang and and is the rgyab ri of gTso tshang Monastery, and the range to the west of Ze kha is called gZig sgang. </p> <p>gTso tshang Monastery is located at the foot of the sTag sgang range and the la btsas that was built at its summit with the help of Bon slebs Nam mkha&rsquo; bstan &rsquo;dzin in 1986 is propitiated on the 13th day of the 4th month. </p> <h4 id=\"b6-1-3-12\">14. Occupation of the local people </h4> <p>Farmers, who, in the past, were organized into military units (see above section). A wide variety of crops grow in the valley - wheat, barley, beans, potatos, peas, and maize.
