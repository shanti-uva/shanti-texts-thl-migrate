The old castle occupies he entire length of the outcrop (41 m). The outer side of this knob of rock (35 m in height) provided a fairly defensible position, as well as high social visibility in this stretch of the <span class=\"popular\">Senge Tsangpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sengge gtsang po</span> valley. A single line of structures, arrayed east-west, once stood on the outcrop. Although significant wall elevations are found, no remains of the roofs are extant. The regular ground plan of the rooms indicates that the roofs were made of wood. Poplar and willow trees hrive further down the <span class=\"popular\">Senge Tsangpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sengge gtsang po</span> valley in <span class=\"popular\">Ladak</span><span class=\"scholar\">La dwags</span>, but perhaps they once grew in his region as well. The east end of the summit is 4.7 m wide but most of it is around 6 m in width. The revetments supporting the buildings along the edges of the formation are minimal &ndash; 1 m or less in height. Below he west side of the summit there are the remains of a single wall (6 m long, up to 3.2 m in height) clinging to a rock face, which was probably constructed for defensive purposes. This wall creates a staging platform 1.9 m in width. <span class=\"popular\">Serzhung Khargok</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gser gzhung mkhar gog</span> was built from the same light-colored uncut granite blocks (generally 15 cm to 40 cm in length) as the neighboring strongholds of <span class=\"popular\">Khargok Dorj&eacute; Yudr&ouml;nma</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mkhar gog rdo rje g.yu sgron ma</span> (A-124) and <span class=\"popular\">Kolok Khargok</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ko logs mkhar gog</span> (A-125). The random-rubble walls (45 cm to 60 cm in thick) were heavily cemented with mud. </p> <p>Defunct arable lands in the vicinity of <span class=\"popular\">Serzhung Khargok</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gser gzhung mkhar gog</span> appear to have been significantly smaller in extent than those at <span class=\"popular\">Kolok Khargok</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ko logs mkhar gog</span> (A-125). This more limited land-base is reflected in the size of the facility, which is smaller than <span class=\"popular\">Kolok Khargok</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ko logs mkhar gog</span>. </p> <h4 id=\"b1-1-77-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>Area residents call <span class=\"popular\">Serzhung Khargok</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gser gzhung mkhar gog</span> a castle of the ancient <span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span> or <span class=\"popular\">Singpa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sing pa</span>. <span class=\"popular\">M&eacute; Drand&uuml;l</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mes dgra &rsquo;dul</span>, an older local resident, stresses the foreign (Indian) origins of the builders of <span class=\"popular\">Serzhung Khargok</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gser gzhung mkhar gog</span>. </p> <h4 id=\"b1-1-77-4\">Site elements</h4> <h5 id=\"b1-1-77-4-1\">Summit complex</h5> <p>From west to east the structures of the summit complex have the following interior dimensions and physical characteristics: </p> <ol> <li>Residential structure RS1 (3.6 m x 3. 6 m) appears to have had a passageway on its north side.</li> <li>Residential structure RS2 (2.5 m x 5.4 m) appears to have had a passageway on the north side of this mostly leveled building. The revetted passageways adjoining S1 and S2 are likely part of the main entrance to he summit complex. </li> <li>Residential structure RS3 (2.3 m x 3.5 m) may have had a small room appended to its north side.</li> <li>Residential structure RS4 (3.7 m x 4.5 m maximum) has walls up to 2 m in height and an L-shaped floor plan.</li> <li>Residential structure RS5 (5.1 m x 2.8 m, walls up to 1.6 m in height) probably had three rooms. There is a 1.1-m gap between S4 and S5.</li> <li>Residential structure RS6 &ndash; (4 m x 4.9 m, walls up to 1.2 m in height). </li> <li>Residential structure RS7 &ndash; (4.3 m x 5.1 m, walls up to 1.4 m in height). There is a gap 1 m in width between S6 and S7.</li> <li>Residential structure RS8 (6 m x 4.4 m, walls up to 1.7 m in height) is irregularly shaped and the most easterly building at the site. This structure probably contained two or three rooms. The east end of the summit is slightly higher and narrower than the west end. </li> </ol> <h5 id=\"b1-1-77-4-2\">Outlying buildings</h5> <p>On the sandy northern flank of the hill, about 6 m below the western portion of the summit, there are the poorly preserved remains of two more buildings. The west structure (6.5 m x 4.5 m), despite having wall fragments up to 1.6 m in height, has been mostly obliterated. This destruction can be partially attributed to he failure of the slope upon which it was built. The east structure (7 m x 4 m?) is even more fragmentary. Its forward wall reaches 1.4 m in height. The main access route to the summit probably passed by these two outlying buildings. </p> <table cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\" class=\"navarrows\"> <tbody> <tr> <td class=\"leftcell\"> <a class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-left.gif\" title=\"Previous Section\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"midcell\"> <a class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-up.gif\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"rightcell\"> <a class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-right.gif\" title=\"Next Section\"/> </a> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div id=\"chap-id\">/bellezza/b1-1-77/</div> <div style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\" class=\"jqmWindow\" id=\"chapRefWindow\"> <div class=\"closebtn\"> <a href=\"#\">Close</a> </div> <div style=\"height: 280px;\" class=\"conx-content\"> <h3>Note Citation for Page <span class=\"pgnm\"/> </h3> <p class=\"biblref\">John Vincent Bellezza, Antiquities of Zhang Zhung: A Comprehensive Inventory of Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Monuments on he Tibetan Upland (Charlottesville, VA 22904:Tibetan &amp; Himalayan Library, 2010), <span class=\"pgnm\"/>. </p> <h3>Bibliographic Citation</h3> <p>John Vincent Bellezza.
