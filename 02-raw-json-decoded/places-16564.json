This conspicuous site, 40 m above the stream, is not particularly well protected; higher ground flanks its south side. Very little of the sandstone ruins that once stood here remain &ndash; only small fragments of revetments. Most of the structures have long since poured down the steep slopes. There has also been a major slope failure engulfing the north side of the summit, carrying away an unknown portion of the facility. Given its location, <span class=\"popular\">Riwa M&ouml;n Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ri ba mon mkhar</span> is likely to have been a palace and/or fortification. The summit is 21 m in length (southeast-northwest) but is now only 2 m to 3 m wide (clearly, at one time it was somewhat wider). While never a large installation, small structures extended at least 5 m below the summit along the south side of the hill. On this south flank two revetment fragments have survived (7 m in length and up to 70 cm in height, 2.5 m in length). On the west side of the summit a revetment segment 8 m in length is still in place, as well as a smaller wall fragment on the north rim of the summit. Stones in these walls reach a maximum length of 70 cm. Little else at the site remains in situ. Just south of <span class=\"popular\">Riwa M&ouml;n Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ri ba mon mkhar</span> there is an abandoned field. </p> <h4 id=\"b1-1-82-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>According to local lore, <span class=\"popular\">Riwa M&ouml;n Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ri ba mon mkhar</span> was an ancient <span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span> castle.</p> <h4 id=\"b1-1-82-4\">Affiliated sites</h4> <h5 id=\"b1-1-82-4-1\">Ri jo ba khang pa</h5> <p>On the east edge of <span class=\"popular\">Riwa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ri ba</span> there is an old house hat reportedly belonged to the <span class=\"popular emph\">Ri Jowa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ri jo ba</span>, the foremost members of a special class of religious practitioners who were influential during the time of the Buddhist <span class=\"popular\">Gug&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ge</span> kings.<a href=\"#n65\" name=\"nb65\" class=\"note\">65</a> It is also locally reported that this house was once owned by relatives of the third <span class=\"popular\">Karmapa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Karma pa</span>, <span class=\"popular\">Rangjung Dorj&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rang byung rdo rje</span> (born in <span class=\"popular\">Mangy&uuml;l Gungtang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mang yul gung thang</span> in 1284 CE). This residence, which miraculously escaped destruction during the Chinese Cultural Revolution, has a random-rubble base and adobe block upper walls. There are both newer and older windows in the two- to three-story tall structure. The <span class=\"popular\">Ri Jowa Khangpa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ri jo ba khang pa</span> is now occupied by an elderly woman. </p> <hr class=\"footnote-divider\"/> <h2>Notes</h2> <div class=\"footnote\"> <a name=\"n65\"/> <a href=\"#nb65\" class=\"note\"> [65] </a> For information on the <span class=\"popular emph\">Ri Jowa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ri jo ba</span> see <span class=\"popular\">Guge Tsering Gyelpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ge tshe ring rgyal po</span>, <span class=\"popular emph\">Gug&eacute; Tsering Gyelp&ouml; Chetsom Choktrik</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">Gu ge tshe ring rgyal po&rsquo;i ched rtsom phyogs bsgrigs</span> (Lhasa: <span class=\"popular\">Trungg&ouml; B&ouml; Rikpa Petr&uuml;n Khang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Krung go&rsquo;i bod rig pa dpe skrun khang</span>, 2005), 159-170. </div> <table cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\" class=\"navarrows\"> <tbody> <tr> <td class=\"leftcell\"> <a class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-left.gif\" title=\"Previous Section\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"midcell\"> <a class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-up.gif\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"rightcell\"> <a class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-right.gif\" title=\"Next Section\"/> </a> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div id=\"chap-id\">/bellezza/b1-1-82/</div> <div style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\" class=\"jqmWindow\" id=\"chapRefWindow\"> <div class=\"closebtn\"> <a href=\"#\">Close</a> </div> <div style=\"height: 280px;\" class=\"conx-content\"> <h3>Note Citation for Page <span class=\"pgnm\"/> </h3> <p class=\"biblref\">John Vincent Bellezza, Antiquities of Zhang Zhung: A Comprehensive Inventory of Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Monuments on he Tibetan Upland (Charlottesville, VA 22904:Tibetan &amp; Himalayan Library, 2010), <span class=\"pgnm\"/>. </p> <h3>Bibliographic Citation</h3> <p>John Vincent Bellezza.
