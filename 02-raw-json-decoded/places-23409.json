Name</h3> <p>bZang ri dgon (often wrongly spelled Zangs ri); its formal name is lHun grub mthong smon gling.</p> <h3 id=\"b4-6-2\">2. Location </h3> <p>The monastery is situated on Mount bZang po ri, behind bZang ri village. It is accessible by car. After reaching Nye mo bridge on the way from Lhasa to Shigatse, and driving northward for eight kilometres, one arrives at the county seat of Nye mo. From here a drive of three kilometres takes one to bZang ri village.</p> <h3 id=\"b4-6-3\">3. History </h3> <p>bZang ri Monastery was founded in 1096 by mKhas pa Tshul khrims dpal chen. It became a great centre for studies in metaphysics, where, over the years, hundreds of monks studied. It was also a place where tantric meditation and rituals were commonly practised. However, the monastery soon began to decline, and did so for several generations. Later it was looked after by sPa ston &rsquo;Od gsal rgyal mtshan, a descendant of the sPa family. This master&rsquo;s main seat was at sMan gong in Shangs. His chief disciple was Zhang ston Ba thang pa. There then followed several masters, such as Zhang ston Tshul khrims blo ldan, Sum ston lHa &rsquo;bum, Sum ston &rsquo;Dul ba bzang po, Sum ston bZang po dpal, mKhas grub rGyal mtshan mchog legs of rMe&rsquo;u and Rong ston Shes rab &rsquo;od zer, all of whom were active in the monastery. The monastery was mainly maintained by the members of the rMe&rsquo;u family. There have been, altogether to date, forty descendants of the rMe&rsquo;u family down to the present rMe&rsquo;u Nyi zla dbang grags. The monastery was originally located east of bZang ri village and was destroyed during the Cultural Revolution. In 1982, its site was moved up to the top of the hill behind the village and was then rebuilt.</p> <h3 id=\"b4-6-4\">4.
