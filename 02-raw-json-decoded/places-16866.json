At the southeast base of the sacred <span class=\"popular\">Yidts&eacute; Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Yid rtse mkhar</span> mountain there is a high volume spring, the source of the <span class=\"popular\">Kongchen Chu</span><span class=\"scholar\">Kong chen chu</span>. <span class=\"popular\">Yidts&eacute; Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Yid rtse mkhar</span> mountain occupies a salient position near the confluence of several valleys and basins. The remains of three cubic tombs are found on a relatively level stretch of ground, which is hemmed in by three large crags. These tombs are perched 230 m above the <span class=\"popular\">Kongchen</span><span class=\"scholar\">Kong chen</span> valley and occupy elevated rocky ground. From the site there are long views in all directions except in the north, the direction of the <span class=\"popular\">Yidts&eacute; Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Yid rtse mkhar</span> summit (5030 m). The terrain is sandy and thickly covered in rocks. The cubic tombs are constructed of a blue-gray grained metamorphic (?) rock of variable length (up to 60 cm long), which has weathered to a reddish color. Some of the stones of the central chambers have orange climax lichen growing on them. Although the tombs are in poor condition, they do not appear to have been disturbed for a long ime. </p> <p>As with virtually all the cubic tombs sites, those of <span class=\"popular\">Yidts&eacute; Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Yid rtse mkhar</span> were probably desecrated when Buddhism became the banner of the dominant political forces of the region. This destruction of tombs was probably part of the process of subjugation and the severing of the old sociopolitical links of which they were apart. The mountaintop cubic tombs, by virtue of their prominent and lofty positions, were conspicuous symbols of the archaic cultural order. </p> <h4 id=\"b2-3-22-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>According to local <span class=\"popular emph\">drok pa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">&rsquo;brog pa</span>, <span class=\"popular\">Yidts&eacute; Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Yid rtse mkhar</span> is an ancient <span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span> monument. </p> <h4 id=\"b2-3-22-4\">Site elements</h4> <p>The outer shells of the three cubic tombs have largely disintegrated. Only tiny coherent wall fragments are extant. None of the tombs appears to have been well aligned in the cardinal directions. The central chambers (reliquaries) of the tombs were carefully constructed.</p> <h5 id=\"b2-3-22-4-1\">Funerary Structure FS1</h5> <p>Funerary structure FS1 (2 m x 2.7 m x 1 [maximum height]) has a partially intact central chamber, which measures 45 cm x 35 cm x 40 cm (depth).</p> <h5 id=\"b2-3-22-4-2\">Funerary Structure FS2</h5> <p>Funerary structure FS2 (2.1 m x 2.3 m x 70 cm) is located 15 m east of FS1 at the same elevation. The base of he central chamber is intact (50 cm x 80 cm x 35 cm [maximum depth]). </p> <h5 id=\"b2-3-22-4-3\">Funerary Structure FS3</h5> <p>Funerary structure FS3 (2 m x 1.5 m x 60 cm) is 4.5 m south of and 1.5 m lower than FS2. The fragmentary base of the central chamber is approximately the same size as that in FS2. </p> <table cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\" class=\"navarrows\"> <tbody> <tr> <td class=\"leftcell\"> <a class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-left.gif\" title=\"Previous Section\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"midcell\"> <a class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-up.gif\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"rightcell\"> <a class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-right.gif\" title=\"Next Section\"/> </a> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div id=\"chap-id\">/bellezza2/b2-3-22/</div> <div style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\" class=\"jqmWindow\" id=\"chapRefWindow\"> <div class=\"closebtn\"> <a href=\"#\">Close</a> </div> <div style=\"height: 280px;\" class=\"conx-content\"> <h3>Note Citation for Page <span class=\"pgnm\"/> </h3> <p class=\"biblref\">John Vincent Bellezza, Antiquities of Zhang Zhung: A Comprehensive Inventory of Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Monuments on he Tibetan Upland (Charlottesville, VA 22904:Tibetan &amp; Himalayan Library, 2010), <span class=\"pgnm\"/>. </p> <h3>Bibliographic Citation</h3> <p>John Vincent Bellezza.
