While <em>bodhicitta</em> may be practiced as a form of meditation, it can also be generated ritualistically in front of a master or a visualized deity. Such a ritual procedure serves to implant the seeds within the disciple for the further cultivation of <em>bodhicitta</em>. The ritualistic generation of <em>bodhicitta </em>is part of many sutra and tantric rituals, like the taking of bodhisattva vows, and tantric initiation. However, <em>bodhicitta</em> generation rituals are sometimes stand-alone rites. The present Dalai Lama often enacts these rituals independent of any others.</p> <h1>Example Texts</h1> <ul> <li><a class=\"tibtext\" href=\"http://tbrc.org/#!rid=W10483\">byang chub sems bskyed pa'i cho ga shin tu rgyas pa</a></li> <li><a class=\"tibtext\" href=\"http://tbrc.org/#!rid=W992\">byang chub kyi sems bskyed pa'i cho ga</a></li> <li><a class=\"tibtext\" href=\"http://tbrc.org/#!rid=W13697\">byang chub sems bskyed pa'i 'bogs chog</a></li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h1>Secondary Sources</h1> <p>Chris: Look at Jeffrey's book on the Kalacakra initiation to see if there is a section on the generation of bodhicitta in a ritualistic fashion.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>","created_at":"2013-09-15 04:07:44 UTC","updated_at":"2014-01-14 21:21:41 UTC","id":391,"title":"Bodhicitta-generation Ritual","is_primary":true}]}
