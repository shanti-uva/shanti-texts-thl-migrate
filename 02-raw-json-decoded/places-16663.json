The terrain is sandy and gently sloping. The main road between <span class=\"popular\">Rutok</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ru thog</span> and the <span class=\"popular\">Ngari</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mnga&rsquo; ris</span> prefectural headquarters runs within 100 m of the archaeological site. Road construction and the building of corrals has disturbed the area around the site. <span class=\"popular\">Tangra Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Thang ra rdo ring</span> was vandalized during the Chinese Cultural Revolution; not one pillar remains whole. The site constitutes one of the most westerly examples of the stelae erected inside an enclosure typology (II.1b) in Upper Tibet (also see C-95 and C-112). The border of <span class=\"popular\">Ladak</span><span class=\"scholar\">La dwags</span> is only about 30 km o the west. </p> <h4 id=\"b2-1-21-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>According to area residents, <span class=\"popular\">Tangra Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Thang ra rdo ring</span> is a sacred site of ancient times.</p> <h4 id=\"b2-1-21-4\">Site elements</h4> <h5 id=\"b2-1-21-4-1\">Enclosure</h5> <p>Fortunately most parts of the four walls of the enclosure have survived. These walls are oriented almost to the intermediate points. The enclosure measures 12 m (southwest-northeast) x 5.7 m (southeast-northwest). The double-course enclosure walls (50 cm to 70 cm thick) were constructed with variable-length (25 cm to 60 cm long) stones. Some of these stones are level with the ground surface while others project as much as 40 cm above it. </p> <h5 id=\"b2-1-21-4-2\">Pillars</h5> <p>All the pillars were erected near the inner edge of the southwest wall (they are mostly concentrated near the north corner) of the enclosure. Originally, there were at least eight pillars. These include seven tabular specimens, all of which are now 50 cm or less in height. At least three types of rocks were used as pillars, including a grayish grained type (igneous?) that was also used to construct the enclosure. Another type of rock is black in color. The main pillar of the site was broken about 40 cm above ground level. The broken upper section is 1.25 m long and has been propped back into position with the help of a pile of stones. This was part of an attempt by local residents to rehabilitate the site. The main pillar is irregularly shaped and has a girth of about 1 m. It is covered in butter and red ochre. This pillar is seasonally propitiated in invocation and offering rituals (<span class=\"popular emph\">solwa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">gsol ba</span>) by the local <span class=\"popular emph\">drok pa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">&rsquo;brog pa</span>, who regard it as the sanctuary of a local divinity.<a href=\"#n32\" name=\"nb32\" class=\"note\">32</a> There are poles, with prayer flags attached, in the pile of rocks supporting the pillar. There is also at least one plaque inscribed with the <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma &#7751;i</span> mantra. Next to he cairn there are ashes from incense offerings.</p> <hr class=\"footnote-divider\"/> <h2>Notes</h2> <div class=\"footnote\"> <a name=\"n32\"/> <a href=\"#nb32\" class=\"note\"> [32] </a> A local territorial deity is <span class=\"popular\">Ama Mentsi</span><span class=\"scholar\">A ma sman rtsis</span> (sp.?), whose home is a mountain to the west.
