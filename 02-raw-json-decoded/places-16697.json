The views to the north and northeast are the most open at he site, but they are not particularly expansive. The well-drained level terrain is sandy and gravelly. Both the enclosure and standing pillar are made of light-colored granite. According to an elderly woman (born circa 1929), who hails from the locale, there used to be three standing stones at <span class=\"popular\">Doring Nakkha</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo ring nag kha</span>, but two of them were uprooted during the Chinese Cultural Revolution.</p> <h4 id=\"b2-1-55-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>None was collected.</p> <h4 id=\"b2-1-55-4\">Site elements</h4> <h5 id=\"b2-1-55-4-1\">Enclosure</h5> <p>The incomplete enclosure is aligned in the cardinal directions and measures 4.6 m (east-west) x 2.9 m (north-south). Given that it contained three pillars, the enclosure may originally have been somewhat larger han this. No intact wall sections remain in the enclosure. The enclosed zone is covered in variable-length (primarily 20 cm to 40 cm long) stones embedded in the ground, which once must have been part of the perimeter walls. These stones protrude as much as 25 cm from the ground surface.</p> <h5 id=\"b2-1-55-4-2\">Pillars</h5> <p>The in situ pillar is 1.1 m in height and has a basal girth of 1.4 m. The broad sides of this highly worn stele are oriented north and south, as is normal in this type of monument. Some parts of the light-colored pillar have weathered to a reddish color. Near the site there is a dislodged pillar (1 m long). </p> <h4 id=\"b2-1-55-5\">Affiliated sites</h4> <p>It is reported that up the <span class=\"popular\">A Ong Tsangpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">A &rsquo;ong gtsang po</span> valley from <span class=\"popular\">Doring Nakkha</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo ring nag kha</span> there is a smaller pillar monument called <span class=\"popular\">Satra Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sa bkra rdo ring</span>. </p> <table cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\" class=\"navarrows\"> <tbody> <tr> <td class=\"leftcell\"> <a class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-left.gif\" title=\"Previous Section\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"midcell\"> <a class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-up.gif\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"rightcell\"> <a class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-right.gif\" title=\"Next Section\"/> </a> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div id=\"chap-id\">/bellezza2/b2-1-55/</div> <div style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\" class=\"jqmWindow\" id=\"chapRefWindow\"> <div class=\"closebtn\"> <a href=\"#\">Close</a> </div> <div style=\"height: 280px;\" class=\"conx-content\"> <h3>Note Citation for Page <span class=\"pgnm\"/> </h3> <p class=\"biblref\">John Vincent Bellezza, Antiquities of Zhang Zhung: A Comprehensive Inventory of Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Monuments on he Tibetan Upland (Charlottesville, VA 22904:Tibetan &amp; Himalayan Library, 2010), <span class=\"pgnm\"/>. </p> <h3>Bibliographic Citation</h3> <p>John Vincent Bellezza.
