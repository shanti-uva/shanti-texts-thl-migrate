These stones protrude a maximum of 50 cm above ground level. No pattern to the placement of the stones could be discerned.\u003c/p\u003e \u003ch5 id=\"b2-2-53-4-2\"\u003eFunerary Structure FS2\u003c/h5\u003e \u003cp\u003eFunerary structure FS2 is situated 11 m west of FS1. It now appears to have an L-shaped form, but this is probably due to the disintegration of the structure. Originally, it is likely to have had a quadrate form. The wo arms of FS3 are 2.4 m and 1.6 m in length and around 80 cm in width. This structure is elevated 20 cm to 50 cm above the surrounding terrain. In close proximity to FS2 there are the faint remains of another small funerary structure. \u003c/p\u003e \u003ch5 id=\"b2-2-53-4-3\"\u003eFunerary Structure FS3\u003c/h5\u003e \u003cp\u003eFunerary structure FS3 (11m x 8 m) is situated 40 m north/up valley of FS2. This well-built double-course quadrate enclosure is made up of large stones (up to 1.2 m long), which prominently protrude (as much as 50 cm) above the ground surface. The robust perimeter walls are 80 cm to 1 m thick. The east wall of the enclosure is mostly flush with the ground level, while the other three walls are up to 50 cm in height due to the projection of stones embedded in the ground as well as the stacking of stones on top of one another. \u003c/p\u003e \u003ch5 id=\"b2-2-53-4-4\"\u003eFunerary Structure FS4\u003c/h5\u003e \u003cp\u003eFunerary structure FS4, a uniquely designed structure, is situated 40 m north/up valley of FS3. FS4 consists of a line of seven large interconnected quadrate cells (they are not well aligned in the cardinal directions). The overall dimensions of FS4 are 74 m (north-south) x 7 m to 8.5 m (east to west). At 10 m, the seventh or most northerly cell (C1) is wider than the other six. The walls of these cells exhibit three major forms of construction: single-course, superficial double-course and double-course walls composed of as many as five vertical layers of stones (random-rubble texture). Some single-course walls are so heavily built as to be cyclopean in appearance. The single-course walls are one or more stones tall. There is no apparent pattern to he stacking of stones in the single-course walls.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFrom north to south, the seven cells of FS4 have the following characteristics:\u003c/p\u003e \u003col\u003e \u003cli\u003eCell C1 consists mainly of well-built double-course walls with stones set about 90 cm apart. These stones project as much as 60 cm from the surface. C1 is partly subdivided by an east-west running wall. \u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003eCell C2 is mostly made up of embedded stones (up to 1.2 m long) that protrude upwards of 60 cm above the ground surface. The intact segments of the north wall consist of stones stacked on top of one another in neatly laid vertical courses. \u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003eCell C3 has an incoherent perimeter. A boulder 3 m in length is incorporated into it. The stones of the cells project as much as 80 cm above ground level.\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003eCell C4 has an ambiguous demarcation due to there being three intervening walls between it and C3. These walls are fragmentary and of an irregular design. The middle intervening wall is double-course and 1.2 m in hickness. There are naturally occurring boulders interspersed between the three walls that demarcate C3 and C4. The walls of C4 are double-course and more than one vertical layer of stones in height.\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003eCell C5 has perimeter walls that are in poor condition. This cell is bisected into east and west sections by the remains of a partition wall. \u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003eCell C6 has double-course stacked perimeter walls but these are no longer in a very integral state. \u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003eCell C7 is largely intact. A large boulder sits in the wall dividing C6 and C7. In some places the perimeter wall consists of a single line of boulders embedded into the ground. Much of the perimeter, however, is made up of double-course walls (50 cm to 1 m in thickness) consisting of more than one layer of stones. These elevated wall sections are up to 70 cm in height and are composed of as many as five vertical courses of variable-length (up to 1 m long) stones.\u003c/li\u003e \u003c/ol\u003e \u003ch5 id=\"b2-2-53-4-5\"\u003eFunerary Structure FS5\u003c/h5\u003e \u003cp\u003eFunerary structure FS5 (7.7 m long) is situated 100 m northwest of FS4. FS5 occupies the northern end of the site and is the farthest from the foot of the enclosing ridge. The perimeter walls of this enclosure are only partially intact. On what appears to be the east side of FS5 there are multiple courses of brown sandstone slabs (around 20 cm long) embedded into the ground edgewise. These courses of slabs cover an area of 2 m x 1.2 m and are oriented in two different directions. \u003c/p\u003e \u003ctable cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\" class=\"navarrows\"\u003e \u003ctbody\u003e \u003ctr\u003e \u003ctd class=\"leftcell\"\u003e \u003ca class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"\u003e \u003cimg src=\"/global/images/arrow-left.gif\" title=\"Previous Section\"/\u003e \u003c/a\u003e \u003c/td\u003e \u003ctd class=\"midcell\"\u003e \u003ca class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"\u003e \u003cimg src=\"/global/images/arrow-up.gif\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"/\u003e \u003c/a\u003e \u003c/td\u003e \u003ctd class=\"rightcell\"\u003e \u003ca class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"\u003e \u003cimg src=\"/global/images/arrow-right.gif\" title=\"Next Section\"/\u003e \u003c/a\u003e \u003c/td\u003e \u003c/tr\u003e \u003c/tbody\u003e \u003c/table\u003e \u003c/div\u003e \u003cdiv id=\"chap-id\"\u003e/bellezza2/b2-2-53/\u003c/div\u003e \u003cdiv style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\" class=\"jqmWindow\" id=\"chapRefWindow\"\u003e \u003cdiv class=\"closebtn\"\u003e \u003ca href=\"#\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/div\u003e \u003cdiv style=\"height: 280px;\" class=\"conx-content\"\u003e \u003ch3\u003eNote Citation for Page \u003cspan class=\"pgnm\"/\u003e \u003c/h3\u003e \u003cp class=\"biblref\"\u003eJohn Vincent Bellezza, Antiquities of Zhang Zhung: A Comprehensive Inventory of Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Monuments on he Tibetan Upland (Charlottesville, VA 22904:Tibetan \u0026amp; Himalayan Library, 2010), \u003cspan class=\"pgnm\"/\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e \u003ch3\u003eBibliographic Citation\u003c/h3\u003e \u003cp\u003eJohn Vincent Bellezza.
