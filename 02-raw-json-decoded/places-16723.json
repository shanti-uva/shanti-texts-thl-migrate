The views to the north and west are constrained by ridges, while the views to the south and east are open. The famous holy mountain <span class=\"popular\">Gangkar Tis&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gangs dkar ti se</span> is visible 40 km to the northeast. There is a small cliff immediately to the west of the pillar. The turf and gravel covered terrain is moderately sloping. </p> <h4 id=\"b2-1-81-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>Local sources report that <span class=\"popular\">Dralung Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gra lung rdo ring</span> is an ancient monument.</p> <h4 id=\"b2-1-81-4\">Site elements</h4> <p>The highly worn gray pillar has weathered to assume a brown color in places. The four uneven sides of <span class=\"popular\">Dralung Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gra lung rdo ring</span> are roughly oriented in the cardinal directions. It is 2.3 m high and has a basal girth of 1 m. It is now inclined in an uphill direction. The zone up to 4 m south of <span class=\"popular\">Dralung Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gra lung rdo ring</span> is strewn with stones, in contrast to the adjoining areas which are free of stones. Perhaps the pillar was once enclosed by walls but, if so, there are virtually no traces left. Near gra lung rdo ring, a few stones are embedded in the ground, however, no order can be discerned in their placement. Another single, tall and slim pillar in the region was indeed erected inside an enclosure (see C-123).</p> <p>In the vicinity of gra lung mon dur there is a small and a larger wall with old inscribed plaques. These two walls were restored after being used in the Chinese Cultural Revolution to form parts of the walls of corrals. On top of the cliff behind gra lung mon dur there is a ruined all-stone <span class=\"popular emph\">Ch&ouml;rten</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mchod rten</span> of significant age. It has a small <span class=\"popular emph\">bhumpa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">bum pa</span> reminiscent of early examples of the monument (pre-13th century CE). Old plaques inscribed with the <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma &#7751;i </span>mantra are scattered on and around the <span class=\"popular emph\">Ch&ouml;rten</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mchod rten</span>. Perhaps these <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma &#7751;i</span> walls and the <span class=\"popular emph\">Ch&ouml;rten</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mchod rten</span> were originally erected to subdue what were construed as negative influences emanating from <span class=\"popular\">Dralung Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gra lung rdo ring</span>. </p> <h4 id=\"b2-1-81-5\">Affiliated sites</h4> <h5 id=\"b2-1-81-5-1\">Gyam brag phug</h5> <p>A cave called <span class=\"popular\">Gyamdrak Puk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gyam brag phug</span> (26 m deep) has a clockwise swastika, conjoined sun and moon (<span class=\"popular emph\">nyida</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">nyi zla</span>) and a Tibetan letter <span class=\"popular emph\">a</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">a</span> scrawled on the ceiling in red ochre (30&deg; 56.4&#900; N. lat. / 81&deg; 00.2&#900; / 4620 m).
