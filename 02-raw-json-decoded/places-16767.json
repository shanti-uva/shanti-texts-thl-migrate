The entire hillside, including the funerary superstructures, has been intensively mined for stones. These stones have been used to construct substantial homes and corrals in the area. On the summit of <span class=\"popular\">Ch&ouml;ser</span><span class=\"scholar\">Phyod ser</span> there is a small <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma &#7751;i</span> wall. </p> <h4 id=\"b2-2-15-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>In this region (<span class=\"popular\">Naktsang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Nag tshang</span>) such sites are often associated with the ancient <span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span>.</p> <h4 id=\"b2-2-15-4\">Site elements</h4> <h5 id=\"b2-2-15-4-1\">Funerary Structure FS1</h5> <p>Funerary structure FS1, a small enclosure, has been heavily mined for stones (30&deg; 55.169&#900; N. lat. / 87&deg; 43.712&#900; E. long. / 4740 m). It was built on the clear, level ground of a saddle. Stones up to 80 cm in length went into he construction of FS2.</p> <h5 id=\"b2-2-15-4-2\">Funerary Structure FS2</h5> <p>Funerary structure FS2 (3 m across) is another small enclosure, situated east of FS1, near the hilltop of <span class=\"popular\">Ch&ouml;ser</span><span class=\"scholar\">Phyod ser</span> (55.181&#900; / 43.781&#900; / 4750 m). It sits on clear, level ground. The probable double-course perimeter walls (around 50 cm thick) are flush with the ground surface, but only small traces remain. Sheep horns have been placed inside the fragmentary enclosure. In he vicinity there appears to be the traces of another superficial structure. </p> <h5 id=\"b2-2-15-4-3\">Funerary Structures FS3 and FS4</h5> <p>Funerary structures FS3 and FS4 are situated 35 m south of FS1 at the south foot of the <span class=\"popular\">Ch&ouml;ser</span><span class=\"scholar\">Phyod ser</span> hill. They were built on moderately sloping, rocky and gravelly terrain. These structures have been so heavily impacted that they could not be positively identified. Local residents deny their <span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span> associations, but their protestations do not seem very credible. It is said that this location was once inhabited by a woman from southern Tibet who built a corral here. FS3 consists of a dispersion that is 6 m across. A slight depression in the ground, encircled by dislodged stones, is all hat remains. FS4 (5 m x 4.5 m) is situated 4 m south of FS3. Its downhill wall is elevated 1 m above the slope, while its upslope wall is elevated 50 cm above the slope. The remaining wall traces appear to be aligned in the cardinal directions. The middle of FS4 has been excavated to a depth of 1 m, probably in the search for valuable artifacts. Stones remaining in the vicinity of FS3 and FS4 are up to 40 cm in length. Larger stones have been carried off.</p> <table cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\" class=\"navarrows\"> <tbody> <tr> <td class=\"leftcell\"> <a class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-left.gif\" title=\"Previous Section\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"midcell\"> <a class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-up.gif\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"rightcell\"> <a class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-right.gif\" title=\"Next Section\"/> </a> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div id=\"chap-id\">/bellezza2/b2-2-15/</div> <div style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\" class=\"jqmWindow\" id=\"chapRefWindow\"> <div class=\"closebtn\"> <a href=\"#\">Close</a> </div> <div style=\"height: 280px;\" class=\"conx-content\"> <h3>Note Citation for Page <span class=\"pgnm\"/> </h3> <p class=\"biblref\">John Vincent Bellezza, Antiquities of Zhang Zhung: A Comprehensive Inventory of Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Monuments on he Tibetan Upland (Charlottesville, VA 22904:Tibetan &amp; Himalayan Library, 2010), <span class=\"pgnm\"/>. </p> <h3>Bibliographic Citation</h3> <p>John Vincent Bellezza.
