The site is in view of <span class=\"popular\">Neri Tsong&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gnas ri mtsho sngon</span>/<span class=\"popular\">Namarche Tso</span><span class=\"scholar\">Na mar che mtsho</span>. The terrain is moderately sloping and blanketed in alpine turf. The rectangular mound of <span class=\"popular\">Ronglung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rong lung</span> is oriented in the cardinal directions and measures 15 m (east-west) x 12.4 m (north-south). Its large size, isolated aspect and lofty position suggest that it featured in the interment/burial rites of a very high status individual or individuals. This structure exhibits the morphological features of both the <span class=\"popular emph\">bangso</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">bang so</span> and terraced funerary constructions. The latter constitutes a very common type of funerary structure in the far eastern <span class=\"popular\">Jangtang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Byang thang</span>. <span class=\"popular\">Ronglung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rong lung</span> is turf-covered and does not appear to have been disturbed in a long time.</p> <h4 id=\"b2-2-36-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>Some local sources mistakenly claim that <span class=\"popular\">Ronglung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rong lung</span> is the ruin of an ancient Buddhist monastery.</p> <h4 id=\"b2-2-36-4\">Site elements</h4> <p>The south/forward/downhill side of <span class=\"popular\">Ronglung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rong lung</span> is elevated about 1.5 m, its west side is elevated about 1.2 m, its east side is elevated as much as 2 m, and on its north/uphill side it only rises about 30 cm above the slope. The height of the east side of the structure can be partly accounted for by a depression in the adjacent terrain. The fragmentary, double-course (60 cm thick) north rim wall is 30 cm in height and is composed of three vertical courses of stones. On the other flanks of the structure there are many stones but without any discernable pattern. On the north and west portions of the top of he mound there are wall traces, which appear to divide the structure into smaller units. Variable length (primarily 20 cm to 50 cm long) uncut, blue and tan metamorphic stones were used in construction of <span class=\"popular\">Ronglung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rong lung</span>. There are also some pieces of red sandstone at the site. </p> <table cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\" class=\"navarrows\"> <tbody> <tr> <td class=\"leftcell\"> <a class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-left.gif\" title=\"Previous Section\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"midcell\"> <a class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-up.gif\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"rightcell\"> <a class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-right.gif\" title=\"Next Section\"/> </a> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div id=\"chap-id\">/bellezza2/b2-2-36/</div> <div style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\" class=\"jqmWindow\" id=\"chapRefWindow\"> <div class=\"closebtn\"> <a href=\"#\">Close</a> </div> <div style=\"height: 280px;\" class=\"conx-content\"> <h3>Note Citation for Page <span class=\"pgnm\"/> </h3> <p class=\"biblref\">John Vincent Bellezza, Antiquities of Zhang Zhung: A Comprehensive Inventory of Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Monuments on he Tibetan Upland (Charlottesville, VA 22904:Tibetan &amp; Himalayan Library, 2010), <span class=\"pgnm\"/>. </p> <h3>Bibliographic Citation</h3> <p>John Vincent Bellezza.
