This 12-km long island rises out of the great salt lake,<span class=\"popular\">Ngangla Ringtso</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ngang la ring mtsho</span>. <span class=\"popular\">Tsodo M&ouml;ndur</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mtsho do mon dur</span> is situated in a locale known as <span class=\"popular\">Kochung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ko chung</span> (sp.?). It has open views across the <span class=\"popular\">Ngangla Ringtso</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ngang la ring mtsho</span> basin to the east. Five enclosures were detected at <span class=\"popular\">Tsodo M&ouml;ndur</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mtsho do mon dur</span>. These structures appear to have a funerary identity and are found on sandy and rock benches. They are primarily constructed from a light-colored, hard, fine-grained rock of variable length (10 cm to 80 cm long). The structures are in a very poor state of preservation, precluding a close assessment of their design characteristics. It appears that these structures had heaped-stone walls. Double-course perimeter walls may also be represented among them. It is quite possible that other structures were overlooked in the rocky terrain during he survey. </p> <p>There is also an archaic residential settlement consisting of all-stone corbelled edifices on <span class=\"popular\">Tsodo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mtsho do</span> (B-131), which is located just over 2 km from the funerary structures. These two sites may be interrelated, as the twin burial and residential components of ancient settlement on the island. <span class=\"popular\">Semodo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Se mo do</span> (D-127) and <span class=\"popular\">Tsodo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mtsho do</span>, two large islands, both appear to support funerary sites. This is not the case on the smaller Upper Tibetan islands with archaic cultural sites. Perhaps a certain minimum physical distance between residential installations and burial grounds was considered desirable by the ancient inhabitants of the islands. </p> <h4 id=\"b2-2-90-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>According to local sources, <span class=\"popular\">Tsodo M&ouml;ndur</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mtsho do mon dur</span> is associated with the ancient <span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span>. </p> <h4 id=\"b2-2-90-4\">Site elements</h4> <h5 id=\"b2-2-90-4-1\">Funerary Structure FS1</h5> <p>Funerary structure FS1 (3.4 m x 5 m) is an irregularly shaped enclosure with unordered perimeter walls (31&deg; 29.82&#900; N. lat. / 83&deg; 14.03&#900; E. long.). These walls reach a maximum height of 30 cm. FS1 has a northeastern aspect. </p> <p>Funerary structures FS2 to FS5 are clustered a little to the southwest of FS1 and all have an eastern aspect.</p> <h5 id=\"b2-2-90-4-2\">Funerary Structure FS2</h5> <p>Funerary structure FS2 (3.5 m x 2.7 m) is a rectangular structure that appears to be aligned in the cardinal directions (29.797&#900; / 14.027&#900;). FS2 was established on a narrow bench and is entirely covered in loose stones. </p> <h5 id=\"b2-2-90-4-3\">Funerary Structure FS3</h5> <p>Funerary structure FS3 (6.7 m x 7 m) is situated 12.7 m upslope of FS2 (29.795&#900; / 14.015&#900;). This ovoid or sub-rectangular structure with an open interior was built into a fairly steep slope. Stones are piled up to a height of 90 cm on its south/forward flank. The slippage of the slope has obliterated much of the upper portion of the structure. </p> <h5 id=\"b2-2-90-4-4\">Funerary Structure FS4</h5> <p>Funerary structure FS4 (6.6 m x 4.8 m) is situated 1 m north of FS3. This ovoid structure has the same setting as FS3 and was built into a fairly steep slope. Its highly degraded perimeter walls enclose an open interior. </p> <h5 id=\"b2-2-90-4-5\">Funerary Structure FS5</h5> <p>Funerary structure FS5 (4.5 m x 4.8 m) is situated 1 m north of FS4 and was also built into a fairly steep slope. The perimeter walls of this ovoid enclosure are in an advanced state of disintegration.</p> <table cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\" class=\"navarrows\"> <tbody> <tr> <td class=\"leftcell\"> <a class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-left.gif\" title=\"Previous Section\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"midcell\"> <a class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-up.gif\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"rightcell\"> <a class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-right.gif\" title=\"Next Section\"/> </a> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div id=\"chap-id\">/bellezza2/b2-2-90/</div> <div style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\" class=\"jqmWindow\" id=\"chapRefWindow\"> <div class=\"closebtn\"> <a href=\"#\">Close</a> </div> <div style=\"height: 280px;\" class=\"conx-content\"> <h3>Note Citation for Page <span class=\"pgnm\"/> </h3> <p class=\"biblref\">John Vincent Bellezza, Antiquities of Zhang Zhung: A Comprehensive Inventory of Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Monuments on he Tibetan Upland (Charlottesville, VA 22904:Tibetan &amp; Himalayan Library, 2010), <span class=\"pgnm\"/>. </p> <h3>Bibliographic Citation</h3> <p>John Vincent Bellezza.
