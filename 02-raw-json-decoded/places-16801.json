The site is also in the shadow of a red mountain called <span class=\"popular\">Marpo Damchok</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dmar po dam phyog</span>. This locale is part of a region traditionally known as dang chung stod ma. The six funerary structures of <span class=\"popular\">Dringak</span><span class=\"scholar\">Grib &rsquo;gag</span>are situated on both benches that flank a stream. The obdurate terrain is level, sandy and gravelly. The presence of a house on each side of the stream, as well as <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma &#7751;i </span>walls and <span class=\"popular emph\">tsa tsa khang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">tshwa tshwa khang</span> indicate that the site has been heavily disturbed. The fragmentary structures mostly consist of double-course enclosures with walls hat are flush with the surface or which slightly project above it. Due to their disintegration, the precise shape of the enclosures is no longer clear. Several types of uncut, variable-length blocky rocks and a few slabs (20 cm o 50 cm long) went into the construction of the enclosures. </p> <h4 id=\"b2-2-49-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>According to local <span class=\"popular emph\">drok pa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">&rsquo;brog pa</span>, <span class=\"popular\">Dringak</span><span class=\"scholar\">Grib &rsquo;gag</span> has ancient <span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span> associations.</p> <h4 id=\"b2-2-49-4\">Site elements</h4> <h5 id=\"b2-2-49-4-1\">West bench</h5> <ol> <li>Funerary structure FS1 (5 m x 5.4 m) has been reduced to remnants of double-course walls that are around 70 cm thick (32&deg; 17.221&#900; N. lat. / 85&deg; 33.380&#900; E. long.). Stones project a maximum of 30 cm above the ground surface.</li> <li>Funerary structure FS2 (7 m across) has had most stones extracted from the superstructure (17.235&#900; / 33.386&#900;). Only small coherent wall fragments have survived.</li> <li>Funerary structure FS3 (4.3 m x 3.9 m) has both blocks and slabs in its highly fragmentary walls (17.240&#900; / 33.391&#900;).</li> <li>Funerary structure FS4 has been reduced to small bits of what appear to be single-course walls (17.244&#900; / 33.393&#900;). </li> </ol> <p>Both funerary structures FS2 and FS4 were built in close proximity to a now ruined shrine, a modern shrine and a <span class=\"popular emph\">tsa tsa khang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">tshwa tshwa khang</span>. These Buddhist features owe heir existence to the extraction of stones from the funerary enclosures. There are small traces of other funerary structures in the vicinity, but their extent and configuration could not be determined. </p> <h5 id=\"b2-2-49-4-2\">East bench</h5> <p>The east bench is slightly lower in elevation than the west bench.</p> <ol> <li>Funerary structure FS5 (2.5 m x 2.2 m) is completely sheathed in embedded stones and appears to represent an alternative type of funerary structure (17.102&#900; / 33.454&#900;). </li> <li>Funerary structure FS6 (5.8 m across) has the remains of double-course perimeter walls around 75 cm thick (17.097&#900; / 33.462&#900;). </li> </ol> <h4 id=\"b2-2-49-5\">Affiliated sites</h4> <h5 id=\"b2-2-49-5-1\">lCags rde&rsquo;u</h5> <p>On the opposite or northeast side of the <span class=\"popular\">Marpo Damchok</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dmar po dam phyog</span> mountain, there are reported to be the vestiges of other funerary superstructures. This site is called <span class=\"popular\">Chakdeu</span><span class=\"scholar\">Lcags rde&rsquo;u</span> (Iron Hill).
