Cubic mountaintop tombs</h2> <h3 id=\"b2-3-8\"> <span class=\"popular\">Milam Khyilam</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mi lam khyi lam</span> </h3> <h4 id=\"b2-3-8-1\">Basic site data</h4> <ul class=\"bullet-blue\"> <li>Site name: <span class=\"popular\">Milam Khyilam</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mi lam khyi lam</span> </li> <li>English equivalent: Human Path Dog Path </li> <li>Site number: E-17</li> <li>Site typology: II.3 </li> <li>Geographic coordinate (N. lat.): 32&ordm; 27&#900; </li> <li>Geographic coordinate (E. long.): 83&ordm; 10&#900; </li> <li>Elevation: 4600 m to 4980 m </li> <li>Administrative location (township): <span class=\"popular\">Oma</span><span class=\"scholar\">&rsquo;O ma</span> </li> <li>Administrative location (county): <span class=\"popular\">Gerts&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sger rtse</span> </li> <li>Survey expedition: UTAE</li> <li>Survey date: June 5, 2001</li> <li>Contemporary usage: Light grazing. </li> <li>Identifiable Buddhist constructions: None. </li> </ul> <h4 id=\"b2-3-8-2\">General site characteristics</h4> <p>The funerary structures of <span class=\"popular\">Milam Khyilam</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mi lam khyi lam</span> are found near two passes known as<span class=\"popular\">Milam Khyilam</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mi lam khyi lam</span> and <span class=\"popular\">Khyichong La</span><span class=\"scholar\">Khyi mchong la</span> (Jumping Dog Pass) and near the summit of a higher ridgeline called <span class=\"popular\">Padma Naky&ouml;l</span><span class=\"scholar\">Padma nag yol</span>. This ridge system rises above the southern margin of the <span class=\"popular\">Tarap Tso</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rta rabs mtsho</span> lake basin. From the long summit there are broad vistas in nearly all directions. The cubic tomb site of <span class=\"popular\">Tanu M&ouml;ndur</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rta nu mon dur</span> (E-8), located about 20 km to the north, is in direct view. To the southeast is the territorial deity (<span class=\"popular\">y&uuml;llha</span><span class=\"scholar\">Yul lha</span>) of the region, the high mountain, <span class=\"popular\">Orok Taktsen</span><span class=\"scholar\">O rog stag btsan</span>.<a href=\"#n83\" name=\"nb83\" class=\"note\">83</a> The remains of probably 22 cubic tombs of various sizes are situated on the slopes and summits of the <span class=\"popular\">Milam Khyilam</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mi lam khyi lam</span> ridge system, beginning about 150 m above the <span class=\"popular\">Tarap Tso</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rta rabs mtsho</span> basin. They form a network of funerary structures extending over a distance of about 3 km to a high point on the ridgeline. Although there are no signs of recent vandalism, as with virtually all the cubic tombs of western Tibet,<span class=\"popular\">Milam Khyilam</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mi lam khyi lam</span> was desecrated in the past. The higher tombs tend to be better preserved, probably because there has been very little visitation or grazing of livestock in this area. All the tombs are built of light brown variable-length (primarily 30 cm to 70 cm long) stone slabs that, in some cases, have darkened to an almost magenta color. Some structures contain stone slabs up to 1.1 m in length. </p> <h4 id=\"b2-3-8-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>Local <span class=\"popular emph\">drok pa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">&rsquo;brog pa</span> widely believe that the cubic tombs of <span class=\"popular\">Milam Khyilam</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mi lam khyi lam</span> are ancient <span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span> burial structures. </p> <h4 id=\"b2-3-8-4\">Site elements</h4> <h5 id=\"b2-3-8-4-1\">Lower reaches group</h5> <h6 class=\"essay\">Funerary Structure FS1</h6> <p>Funerary structure FS1 appears to be the traces of the lowest elevation cubic tomb at the site (32&deg; 27.146&#900; / 83&deg; 10.918&#900; / 4600 m); however, not enough remains in place to positively identify these remains. This structure is set on the first rocky eminence rising above the <span class=\"popular\">Tarap Tso</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rta rabs mtsho</span> lake basin. </p> <h6 class=\"essay\">Funerary Structures FS2 and FS3</h6> <p>Funerary structures FS2 and FS3 appear to be the remains of two cubic tombs but very little of these structures survives (26.863&#900; / 10.699&#900; / 4650 m). They are located higher up the ridgeback from FS1. </p> <h5 id=\"b2-3-8-4-2\">Mi lam khyi lam and Khyi mchong la group</h5> <h6 class=\"essay\">Funerary Structure FS4</h6> <p>Funerary structure FS4 (2.8 m x 1.6 m x 70 cm [maximum height]) is situated on a subsidiary summit of the ridgeline, on ground lightly strewn with talus (26.802&#900; / 10.603&#900; / 4690 m). Although part of the cubic tomb has been leveled, a small portion of its central depository (reliquary) is intact. Due to the dissolution of he structure, it could not be determined whether it was aligned in the cardinal directions.</p> <h6 class=\"essay\">Funerary Structure FS5</h6> <p>Funerary structure FS5 (2.8 m 1.6 m x 1 m) is located in the vicinity of FS4 in an analogous setting (26.780&#900; / 10.572&#900; / 4700 m). The middle of the structure has been gutted, therefore the size of the central depository is no longer evident. In this large hollow in the structure there are traces of osteological materials. A small bone fragment, possibly belonging to a human, was collected from this cubic tomb and subjected to chronometric analysis.<a href=\"#n84\" name=\"nb84\" class=\"note\">84</a> While the provenance of the assayed sample is unclear, it demonstrates that bones upwards of 1000 years old found their way into cubic tombs. The dated bone fragment may possibly have been part of an original interment or deposited as part of a subsequent adventitious burial. It is also possible that its deposition was a matter of happenstance. </p> <h6 class=\"essay\">Funerary Structure FS6</h6> <p>Funerary structure FS6 is situated 7.5 m west of FS5 on the ridge-top. It has been reduced to traces of the foundation.</p> <h6 class=\"essay\">Funerary Structure FS7</h6> <p>Funerary structure FS7 (2.8 m x 1.8 m x 60 cm) is situated just below the precipitous south side of the ridge-top on a slope lightly strewn with talus (26.776&#900; / 10.621&#900; / 4690 m). This location is in close proximity to the <span class=\"popular\">Milam Khyilam</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mi lam khyi lam</span> and <span class=\"popular\">Khyichong La</span><span class=\"scholar\">Khyi mchong la</span> passes. It overlooks he juncture of the <span class=\"popular\">Tarap Tso</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rta rabs mtsho</span> and <span class=\"popular\">Oma Tso</span><span class=\"scholar\">&rsquo;O ma mtsho</span> lake basins, a powerful geomantic configuration.<a href=\"#n85\" name=\"nb85\" class=\"note\">85</a> FS7 appears to have been aligned in the cardinal directions. The top of the structure has been completed engulfed by rubble. </p> <h6 class=\"essay\">Funerary Structure FS8</h6> <p>Funerary structure FS8 (1.6 m x 1.6 m x 60 cm) is situated on the east side of <span class=\"popular\">Khyichong La</span><span class=\"scholar\">Khyi mchong la</span> (26.808&#900; / 10.422&#900; / 4690 m). The walls of this tomb were probably aligned in the cardinal directions but too little remains in place to know for certain.</p> <h6 class=\"essay\">Funerary Structure FS9</h6> <p>Funerary structure FS9 (2.4 m x 4 m x 1 m to 1.3 m) is situated less than 2 m away from FS8. This unusually large specimen is not well aligned in the compass points. Its central depository measures 2.3 m x 90 cm, and is one of the only such internal spaces in any cubic tomb surveyed to date that could have potentially accommodated a whole adult corpse. There is still one in situ stone (1.1 m long) capping the 70-cm deep central depository. </p> <h6 class=\"essay\">Funerary Structure FS10</h6> <p>Funerary structure FS10 (1.7 m x 2.5 m x 90 cm) is situated on the west side of <span class=\"popular\">Khyichong La</span><span class=\"scholar\">Khyi mchong la</span> (26.823&#900; / 10.319&#900; / 4700 m). The op of this structure is completely filled with rubble.</p> <h5 id=\"b2-3-8-4-3\">Padma nag yol group</h5> <h6 class=\"essay\">Funerary Structure FS11</h6> <p>Funerary structure FS11 (2 m x 2.3 m x 1m) is located northwest of FS10, on a higher ridge called <span class=\"popular\">Padma Naky&ouml;l</span><span class=\"scholar\">Padma nag yol</span> (26.957 / 10.009 / 4780 m). FS11 is situated on a southern aspect talus-covered shelf, just below the ridgeline. Much of this structure has been leveled.</p> <h6 class=\"essay\">Funerary Structure FS12</h6> <p>Funerary structure FS12 is located near FS11 on the very eastern end of the talus-blanketed <span class=\"popular\">Padma Naky&ouml;l</span><span class=\"scholar\">Padma nag yol</span> summit. In this extremely large structure (3.6 m x 4 m x 40 cm to 60 cm) there appear to be the traces of a central depository, identifying it as sepulchral in function. </p> <h6 class=\"essay\">Funerary Structure FS13</h6> <p>Funerary structure FS13 is situated on the summit, 6 m west of FS12. It is a similarly sized and constructed structure but in a much more degraded condition. </p> <p>Funerary structure FS14</p> <p>Funerary structure FS14 is situated in close proximity to FS13 (27.014&#900; / 10.033&#900; / 4780 m). This smaller structure has been leveled. FS14 appears to be the remains of a cubic tomb. </p> <h6 class=\"essay\">Funerary Structure FS15</h6> <p>Funerary structure FS15 (2 m x 2 m x 50 cm) is situated higher up the <span class=\"popular\">Padma Naky&ouml;l</span><span class=\"scholar\">Padma nag yol</span> summit ridge (27.012&#900; / 09 995&#900; / 4800 m). The integral lower walls of this structure envelop the base of the central depository, which is filled with debris. </p> <h6 class=\"essay\">Funerary Structure FS16</h6> <p>Funerary structure FS16 (2.5 m x 1.9 m x 1 m) is situated much higher up the ridge-top (27.023 / 09.766 / 4880m). Its central depository is largely intact and well aligned in the cardinal directions: it measures 75 cm (east-west) x 40 cm (north-south) x 60 cm deep. </p> <h6 class=\"essay\">Funerary Structure FS17</h6> <p>Funerary structure FS17 (2.6 m x 2.4 m x 1.1 m) is located on the summit at a slightly higher elevation than FS16 (27.011&#900; / 09.747&#900;). The remains of its central depository are filled with earth and stones.</p> <h6 class=\"essay\">Funerary Structure FS18</h6> <p>Funerary structure FS18 (1.8 m x 1.8 m x 1 m) is located higher up the summit ridge and overlooks the sheer south side of the mountain (27.009&#900; / 09.601&#900; / 4930 m). The mostly intact central depository is not well aligned in the cardinal directions and measures 40 cm x 50 cm x 70 deep. This is one of the best preserved cubic tombs at the <span class=\"popular\">Milam Khyilam</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mi lam khyi lam</span> site. </p> <h6 class=\"essay\">Funerary Structure FS19</h6> <p>Funerary structure FS19 (2.3 m x 1.9 m x 1 m) is also one of the best preserved cubic tombs at the site (27.014 / 09 585 / 4930 m). The large central depository is well aligned in the cardinal directions and measures 1 m (east-west) x m (60 cm) x 60 cm (depth). </p> <h6 class=\"essay\">Funerary Structure FS20</h6> <p>Funerary structure FS20 (1.4 m x 1.8 m x 70 cm) is located just below the south side of the summit, higher up he ridgeline (26.978&#900; / 09.371&#900; / 4980 m). FS20, a largely collapsed cubic tomb, is surrounded by rock ledges on three sides. </p> <h6 class=\"essay\">Funerary Structure FS21</h6> <p>Funerary structure FS21 is located on the summit, a few meters from FS20. This almost entirely destroyed specimen is not fully identifiable.</p> <h6 class=\"essay\">Funerary Structure FS22</h6> <p>Funerary structure FS22 (2 m x 2.2 m x 70 cm to 1.3 m), a well preserved cubic tomb, is situated farther west on the summit ridge (27.005&#900; / 09.315&#900; / 4980 m). FS22 overlooks the south side of <span class=\"popular\">Padma Naky&ouml;l</span><span class=\"scholar\">Padma nag yol</span>. The walls of the central depository (80 cm x 1.2 m x 60 cm [deep]) are not very regular. Some capstones are still in place along the east side of the central depository. This is the most westerly funerary structure at <span class=\"popular\">Milam Khyilam</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mi lam khyi lam</span>, although the ridgeline continues west for some distance. The lack of tombs on the west end of the summit seems to suggest that this direction was not as important to the builders as the eastern vista. </p> <hr class=\"footnote-divider\"/> <h2>Notes</h2> <div class=\"footnote\"> <a name=\"n83\"/> <a href=\"#nb83\" class=\"note\"> [83] </a> <span class=\"popular emph\">orok</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">o rog</span> is the word for crow (<span class=\"popular emph\">porok</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">po rog</span>) in the local dialect. </div> <div class=\"footnote\"> <a name=\"n84\"/> <a href=\"#nb84\" class=\"note\"> [84] </a> FS5: AMS analysis, sample no.
