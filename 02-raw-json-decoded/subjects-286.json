This group encompasses about two hundred and fifty languages, spoken mainly in the Himalayas, on the Tibetan plateau, and in the vicinity of the Mekong and the Salween. Within this linguistic family there are only two ancient literary languages: Burmese (twelfth century) and Tibetan (seventh century). While very different, the common parentage of these two languages means that they share certain characteristics of phonology, syntax, and vocabulary.</p> <p class=\"Paragraph\">The Tibeto-Burman group of languages is part of the Sino-Tibetan superfamily, which compares in size and diversity with the Indo-European family. (Remember that this Indo-European family includes such disparate languages as English, Greek, Russian, Persian, Hindi, French, Swedish, etc.) Apart from Tibeto-Burman, the Sino-Tibetan family includes the Karen and Chinese languages (comprising most importantly the languages of Wu, Xiang, Hakka, Mandarin, and Min). These groups of languages are however only distantly related.</p> <p class=\"Paragraph\">With the exception of Burmese, Tibetan is entirely different from the other major languages of the region, both in terms of syntax and vocabulary. These other languages are Chinese, Hindi, Nepali, the Turkish languages (Uigur, Kazakh, Tatar, etc.), and Mongolian.</p> <p>Tibetan in its various dialects is spoken over an area the size of Western Europe, stretching from Baltistan (Pakistan) in the west, to Sichuan (China) in the east. To the north, the linguistic range of Tibetan extends beyond Lake Kokonor (in the province of Qinghai, China). Its southern limits are the southern slopes of the Himalaya, encompassing the independent state of Bhutan, Sikkim (India), the high valleys of Mustang and D&ouml;lpo, and Solukhumbu (Nepal), the region of Everest inhabited by the Sherpas of Nepal.</p>","created_at":"2013-09-15 04:03:57 UTC","updated_at":"2013-09-15 04:03:57 UTC","id":47,"title":"Introduction: The Tibetan Language","is_primary":false},{"authors":[{"fullname":"Nicolas Tournadre","id":"6"}],"source_url":null,"content":"<h1 class=\"Paragraph\">Overview</h1> <p class=\"Paragraph\">There are dozens of Tibetan dialects spread over five countries: China, Bhutan, Nepal India, and Pakistan.

(Note that this is a tentative classification. For some dialects such as Sherpa or Mustangi, further research is needed to establish their affiliation.)</p> <ol> <li>The &Uuml;-Tsang group: &Uuml;, Lhokha, Kongpo, Tsang, T&ouml;.</li> <li>The T&ouml; subgroup of &Uuml;-Tsang includes dialects from Ngari and Zhikats&eacute; prefectures in the T.A.R. as well as various dialects spoken in northwestern Nepal (Limi, Mugu, Dolpo, Mustangi, and Nubri) and northeastern Nepal (Lhomi, Dhrogpai Gola, and Walungchung Gola).</li> <li>The Kham-Hor group: Central Kham (Deg&eacute; and Chamdo area), Southern Kham (Dechen area), Northern Kham (Y&uuml;shu, Nangchen area), Northeastern Kham (Tewo, Choni), and Hor (Nakchu area).</li> <li>The Amdo group: North Kokonor Amdo (Kangtsa, Chilen, etc.), West Kokonor Amdo (Dulan, Nagormo, etc.), Southeast Kokonor Amdo (Chentsa, Trika, Hualong, etc.), Southern Gansu Amdo (Labrang, Luchu, etc.), Golok Amdo (Machen, Mat&ouml;, Gabde, etc.), Ngapa Amdo (Ngapa, Dzorg&eacute;, Dzamtang, etc.) and Kandz&eacute; area Amdo spoken by some nomad tribes.</li> <li>The Dzongkha-Sikkimese group: Dzongkha, Lakha, Chochangacha, Sikkimese, Merak Sakteng Drokpa, Dur Drokpa.</li> <li>The Ladakhi-Balti group: Ladakhi, Balti, Purik.</li> <li>The Lahul-Spiti group: Lahul, Spiti, Nyamskat.</li> <li>The Sherpa-Jirel group: Solu Sherpa, Khumbu Sherpa, Jirel (all spoken in northeastern Nepal).</li> <li>The Kyirong-Kagate group: Kyirong (spoken in Kyirong county, T.A.R.), and Kagate, Tsum, Langtang, and Yolmo (sometimes called Helambu Sherpa), all spoken in northeastern Nepal.<a name=\"n2\" href=\"#fn2\">[2]</a></li> </ol> <p class=\"Paragraph\">Mutual comprehension is generally good between the dialects of the &Uuml;-Tsang group and Standard Tibetan. On the other hand, with the dialects of the other groups, communication is severely limited if their speakers know absolutely no standard or Literary Tibetan. Of these the furthest removed from central Tibetan are the dialects of Ladakh, Baltistan, and Amdo, which did not develop tones.</p> <p class=\"Paragraph\">Nomad-pastoralists, from whichever region (Ngari, Nakchu, Kham, etc.), have a particular speech referred to as <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">འབྲོག་སྐད་</span>, as distinct from the speech of sedentary agriculturalists, which is described as <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">རོང་སྐད་</span>. The word <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">རོང་པ་</span> refers to farming communities in the low-lying valleys, as opposed to the nomads. Tibetans in Nepal use the term to denote the ethnic groups of the middle hills.(Drokk&eacute;, Rongk&eacute;, rongpa)</p> <p class=\"Paragraph\">Amongst the populations bordering Tibet, many people speak Tibetan. Two examples are the populations of Gyarong <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">རྒྱལ་རོང་ </span>and Minyak <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">མི་ཉག་</span> in Sichuan. The inhabitants of both Gyarong and Minyak consider themselves Tibetans and they usually speak Tibetan. However, in neither case is the native language a Tibetan dialect, although Tibetan is used by both as the literary language.</p> <p>It should be noted finally that within the Tibetan-speaking world, most educated people in the cities speak at least one or even two languages apart from their native Tibetan language: Chinese, Hindi-Urdu, Nepali, or English depending on the country where they live.</p> <hr size=\"1\" /> <p><a name=\"fn1\" href=\"#n1\">[1]</a> For more details, see George Van Driem, <em>Dzongkha</em>, written with the collaboration of Karma Tshering of Gaselo (Leiden: Research CNWS, School of Asian, African, and Amerindian Studies: 1998).</p> <p><a name=\"fn2\" href=\"#n2\">[2]</a> I am grateful to Roland Bielmeier who provided valuable information on dialects of Nepal and Pakistan, personal communication, February 2003.</p>","created_at":"2013-09-15 04:03:57 UTC","updated_at":"2013-09-15 04:03:57 UTC","id":48,"title":"The Main Tibetan Dialects","is_primary":false},{"authors":[{"fullname":"Nicolas Tournadre","id":"6"}],"source_url":null,"content":"<p class=\"Paragraph\">&ldquo;Standard Tibetan&rdquo; corresponds to the language spoken in Central Tibet in the region of Lhasa, as well as among the diaspora community. The Tibetan word for Standard Tibetan is <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">སྤྱི་སྐད་</span>, which literally means &ldquo;common language.&rdquo; Strictly speaking, instead of &ldquo;Standard Tibetan,&rdquo; it would be more accurate to describe this as &ldquo;language in the process of standardization.&rdquo; There is in fact neither a genuine academy of the Tibetan language, nor the political will to round off the process of standardization, which is nevertheless taking place naturally.</p> <p class=\"Paragraph\">Standard Tibetan is a variety of the &ldquo;Central Tibetan&rdquo; <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">དབུས་སྐད་</span> spoken around Lhasa, and has become the lingua franca among Tibetans. It allows Tibetans living in other regions of Tibet (Amdo, Kham, Ngari, etc.), and indeed those residing in China, India, Nepal, Bhutan, Europe, and North America, to communicate with one another whatever their native dialect ཡུལ་སྐད་. Though Standard Tibetan is based on Central Tibetan, there are actually several varieties of Central Tibetan, reflecting the peculiarities and linguistic variations between different valleys, or even between different villages, in Central Tibet. However, these differences are minimal and do not hinder communication. In 1999, an important book called <em>Collective Work on the Common Tibetan Language</em><a name=\"n1\" href=\"#fn1\"><em><strong>[1]</strong></em></a> was published in Beijing, with the participation of many prominent scholars from all the regions of Tibet. This is the first major recognition of Standard Tibetan based on Lhasa dialect.</p> <p class=\"Paragraph\">It should be noted that some intellectuals from Amdo and even from Kham are reluctant to learn the current &ldquo;Standard Tibetan,&rdquo; based on Central Tibetan. They would prefer a common language not entirely derived from the latter. Unfortunately such a language does not exist. When Amdowas or Khampas meet natives of Tsang or Central Tibet they have no other option, if they don&rsquo;t know &ldquo;Standard Spoken Tibetan,&rdquo; but to converse in Chinese or English (depending on the country in which they find themselves), or indeed to write in Literary Tibetan, which is common to all Tibet but is not a spoken language. At Tibetology conferences throughout the world (in China, Europe, India, and the United States), speakers normally use Standard Tibetan whatever their dialect of origin.</p> <p class=\"Paragraph\">The general term <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">བོད་སྐད་</span>, &ldquo;Tibetan language,&rdquo; is also sometimes used to describe the lingua franca, although this usage has the disadvantage of being used also to describe the other dialects. Other terms for the lingua franca are ཁ་སྐད་ &ldquo;spoken language,&rdquo; <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">གཅིག་འགྱུར་སྐད་ </span>&ldquo;unified language,&rdquo; and <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ཕལ་སྐད་</span> &ldquo;ordinary language&rdquo;&mdash;which differentiates it from Literary Tibetan <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ཡིག་སྐད་</span>.</p> <p class=\"Paragraph\">The term &ldquo;Lhasa language&rdquo; <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ལྷ་སའི་སྐད་</span>, often used to describe Standard Tibetan, has too narrow a meaning to be accurate. The language spoken in Tibet&rsquo;s capital includes peculiarities not found in villages just outside. Conversely, a knowledge of Central or Standard Tibetan allows a clear understanding of the dialect <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">གཙང་སྐད་</span> spoken in the province of Tsang, of which the main town is Zhikats&eacute;. On the basis of this similarity, the term <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">དབུས་གཙང་སྐད་</span> is sometimes used to refer to this group of dialects.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <hr size=\"1\" /> <p><a name=\"fn1\" href=\"#n1\">[1]</a> <em>Bod kyi skad yig slob sbyong dang bed spyod gong &rsquo;phel bcas gtong rgyu&rsquo;i bod rang skyong ljongs kyi gtan &rsquo;bebs</em> (Beijing: Mi rigs dpe skrun khang, 1999).</p> <p>﻿</p>","created_at":"2013-09-15 04:03:58 UTC","updated_at":"2013-09-15 04:03:58 UTC","id":49,"title":"Standard Tibetan","is_primary":false},{"authors":[{"fullname":"Nicolas Tournadre","id":"6"}],"source_url":null,"content":"<p class=\"Paragraph\">Literary Tibetan, <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ཡིག་སྐད་</span> or <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ཡིག་རྩོམ་བོད་ཡིག་</span>, is common to scholars and educated people of all regions of Tibet, as well as the countries where Vajrayana Buddhism is established. Literary Tibetan and Standard Tibetan share the same basic grammar and are very similar lexically, to the extent that with a knowledge of one it is possible to read the other without too much difficulty.</p> <p class=\"Paragraph\">Many Tibetans, as well as some non-Tibetans, say that spoken dialects do not have true grammars. Educated Tibetans are mildly disparaging of their spoken language, which they consider &ldquo;vulgar&rdquo; or &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; (<span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ཕལ་སྐད་</span>). In this view, only classical Literary Tibetan is well regarded enough to be &ldquo;blessed&rdquo; with a grammar. Linguists oppose such claims as false, and for non-specialists, it is worth stressing that Standard Spoken Tibetan does indeed possess a grammar. While fundamentally similar to that of literature, the grammar of the spoken language contains certain peculiarities. (Examples include the working of auxiliaries and the way in which they are used with different connectives, or evidentials, which are one of the characteristics unique to the oral language.) The literary and oral registers are better regarded as two poles. Some works in Literary Tibetan reveal the influence of the spoken language, while the reverse is also true: letters written in the vernacular contain literary features. The difference between the two registers is greater than in the case of spoken and literary English.</p> <p class=\"Paragraph\">In contrast to Standard or Central Tibetan, Literary Tibetan is not normally used for conversation. However, some lamas or lay intellectuals use a form of expression which is virtually Literary Tibetan, referred to as the &ldquo;speech of the learned&rdquo;<span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\"> མཁས་པའི་ཁ་སྐད་</span>. There is therefore a real diglossia in their speech.</p> <p class=\"Paragraph\">It is possible to identify in Literary Tibetan, depending on period and region, different types, styles, and registers, each belonging to one of three broad categories:</p> <ul> <li>&middot; Old Tibetan (7th to 11th century)</li> <li>&middot; Classical Literary Tibetan (12th to 19th century)</li> <li>&middot; Modern Literary Tibetan (20th century)</li> </ul> <p class=\"Paragraph\">Modern Literary Tibetan includes the language of journalism (<span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">གསར་ཤོག་གི་སྐད་ཡིག་</span>), as well as modern biographies (<span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">རྣམ་ཐར་</span>), scientific texts, and novels. It should be noted that Modern Literary Tibetan is still very conservative in its grammar, such that a non-specialist can read texts going back as far as the 12th century and even beyond. To this extent, Tibetan is comparable to Hebrew or Persian. By contrast, other languages such as French, English, and Chinese have evolved much more rapidly, such that their writings from the fifteenth century are effectively accessible only to specialists.</p> <p class=\"Paragraph\">In terms of vocabulary, on the other hand, Modern Literary Tibetan has a large stock of neologisms, relating mainly to technical inventions. There are also some words in Standard Tibetan that do not have a literary form, or that have a pronunciation notably different from that in Literary Tibetan.</p>","created_at":"2013-09-15 04:03:58 UTC","updated_at":"2013-09-15 04:03:58 UTC","id":50,"title":"Literary Tibetan","is_primary":false},{"authors":[{"fullname":"Nicolas Tournadre","id":"6"}],"source_url":null,"content":"<p class=\"Paragraph\">The term<span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\"> ཆོས་སྐད་</span>, &ldquo;language of Dharma,&rdquo; refers to the language of religion and philosophy.

It is sometimes said that some lama has been giving teachings in a Kham or Amdo dialect. In fact this happens when lamas are at home, but it is rare when they teach Dharma outside their native region. In that case they use the Standard Spoken language mixed with Literary Tibetan, and pronounce the words with an accent of their native dialect.</p> <p class=\"Paragraph\">The use of Classical Tibetan as a liturgical language is widespread even outside the Tibetan-speaking world, particularly in Mongolia and in the Russian Federation in Buriatia, Tuva, and in Khalmykia.

When a statement cannot be immediately associated with a concrete situation of communication, Tibetans tend not to accept it or to find it strange. One consequence of this attitude is a reluctance to present verbs in a series of conjugations. For example, when the verb &ldquo;to be&rdquo; is &ldquo;mechanically&rdquo; conjugated (&ldquo;I am a student,&rdquo; &ldquo;you are a student,&rdquo; etc.), Tibetan speakers will accept the first person without any trouble but often stop short at the second, since the absence of a marked intonation makes it difficult for them to imagine a situation in which they would be telling someone, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a student!&rdquo; since the addressee is obviously in a better position than they are to know this.</p>","created_at":"2013-09-15 04:03:58 UTC","updated_at":"2013-09-15 04:03:58 UTC","id":54,"title":"The Importance of Situation and Context","is_primary":false},{"authors":[{"fullname":"Nicolas Tournadre","id":"6"}],"source_url":null,"content":"<p class=\"Paragraph\">Written Tibetan<span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\"> བོད་ཡིག་ </span>is derived from Devanāgarī writing (more specifically from the Gupta variant of this, once used in northern India), and bears some similarities to written Burmese and other alphabets of Southeast Asia, which also derive from Devanāgarī.
