This particle is used mainly as a coordinating conjunction (or connective) meaning &ldquo;and&rdquo; (xxlink 9.3.3 on the conjunction dang). However, it also corresponds to a case, the <strong>associative</strong>, traditionally referred to as <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">དང་སྒྲ་</span>, literally &ldquo;sound of &lsquo;with,&rsquo;&rdquo; which is generally translated as &ldquo;with&rdquo; or &ldquo;against&rdquo; or &ldquo;from,&rdquo; or else is not translated at all. In the literary language, it may function as a temporal connective meaning &ldquo;as soon as.&rdquo;</p> <p class=\"Paragraph\">In the spoken language, this case-related function is little used, and applies to a very limited number of verbs. Furthermore, it may sometimes be replaced by other cases such as the absolutive or the oblique.
