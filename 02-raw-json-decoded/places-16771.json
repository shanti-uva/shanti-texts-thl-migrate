These structures, most or all of which were used for burial purposes, are not aligned in the cardinal directions nor could any pattern in their overall distribution be discerned. The tombs are spread out over an area of several hectares. Most of the superstructures are either quadrate constructions elevated significantly above the ground surface or non-descript enclosures level with the ground surface. It appears that hese superstructures of variable size were of the superficial enclosure or \u003cspan class=\"popular emph\"\u003ebangso\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"scholar emph\"\u003ebang so\u003c/span\u003e type, however, most structural evidence on the surface has been severely disturbed. The superstructures contained variable length (20 cm to 80 cm) unhewn light-colored stones, which were embedded in he ground along the perimeter. The subsurface architecture (at least where visible) consists of well-built masonry-lined walls, generally built with large slabs (up to 1 m or more in length). Massive capstones (up to at least 2.1 m long) were placed upon these walls. The floors of the cists are not visible; rather they are obscured by soil and debris. It could not therefore be determined what type of base the burial chambers possessed. Due to he obscuring of the cists by rubble, capstones and the soil overlay, their precise dimensions could not be determined. It appears that many of these cists were relatively long and narrow with wider chambers at each end. In addition to the 19 major structures of \u003cspan class=\"popular\"\u003eGyamnak M\u0026ouml;nkhang\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"scholar\"\u003eGyam nag mon khang\u003c/span\u003e, there are several smaller highly fragmentary constructions scattered about.

They smashed the superstructures to reach large stones capping the burial chambers.

A number of tombs were very seriously damaged in this operation and are now exposed to the full fury of the elements. The stones were transported several kilometers away to the \u003cspan class=\"popular\"\u003eGangchen\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"scholar\"\u003eGangs chen\u003c/span\u003eflood plain and used to build culverts along the main road to southwestern Tibet. More stones were pilfered than were needed for this work and now lie unused on the roadside. The opened tombs have been cleared of any contents they might have once held. Inquires as to what was recovered by the road gang did not turn up any hard information. No artifacts, bones or other materials were detected at the site, but only a cursory search was conducted. In addition to the recent case of vandalism, there are tombs with highly eroded subsurface members on the surface, which may well be evidence of an earlier pilferage of the site.

FS2 is elevated about 1 m above the surrounding terrain. Due to the excavation of the tomb, two in situ capstones are now exposed. These capstones measure at least 1.5 m x 1 m and 1.2 m x 1 m.\u003c/p\u003e \u003ch5 id=\"b2-2-19-4-3\"\u003eFunerary sructure FS3\u003c/h5\u003e \u003cp\u003eFunerary sructure FS3 (11.6 m x 16.2 m) is situated 50 m south of FS2 (36.544\u0026#900; / 38.360\u0026#900;). This large structure is elevated 1m above the surrounding terrain on its north side and as much as 2 m on its south side. The superstructure consists of two mounds, the north one of which was partially opened by road workers in order to remove capstones. There are still two in situ capstones (2 m x 60 cm, 2.1 m x 50 cm) suspended over the opened grave chamber. This rectangular cist currently has a maximum depth of 1.4 m. The subsurface walls of the cist were either partially or completely lined in random-work masonry (containing stone slabs that regularly attain 1 m in length). These walls act as the structural support for the capstones. The southeast extremity of the north burial chamber has four more large in situ capstones. These capstones are tightly pressed against one another. One of them is partially exposed while the other three are still covered by soil and small cobbles. The configuration of the four capstones indicates that the entire burial chamber was sealed by a tight-knit series of large stones. The south mound of the FS3 superstructure does not appear to have been recently disturbed. \u003c/p\u003e \u003ch5 id=\"b2-2-19-4-4\"\u003eFunerary sructure FS4\u003c/h5\u003e \u003cp\u003eFunerary sructure FS4 (3.8 m x 2.8 m) is situated 2.8 m east of FS3 (36.542\u0026#900; / 38.369\u0026#900;).

Like FS3, FS6 was cloaked in earth and small cobbles. The superstructure is elevated about 1 m above the surrounding terrain. The entire breadth of the structure was opened in order to remove stones. Only two large capstones remain in place. The walls of the cist are generally made of large slabs, 1 m or more in length. The current maximum depth of the burial chamber is 1.2 m.
