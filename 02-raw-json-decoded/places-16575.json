Old terracing and the eroded surfaces of once tilled land fill the valley. The locale is now completely devoid of people and agriculture. A <span class=\"popular\">Shangts&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Shang rtse</span> township subdivision headman from the nearby settlement of <span class=\"popular\">Shizh&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Shis bzhad</span> estimates that <span class=\"popular\">Rula</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ru la</span> once supported well over 2000 <span class=\"emph\">mu</span> of farmland (1 <span class=\"emph\">mu</span> = .067 of a hectare). As the <span class=\"popular\">Shangts&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Shang rtse</span> river still flows quite strongly through this pocket of the valley, environmental degradation is not likely the only factor explaining the demise of <span class=\"popular\">Rula</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ru la</span> and other nearby settlements. While a relatively large population (potentially hundreds of people) may have once resided at this location, robust physical signs of their presence were not detected. Nevertheless, a little to the east of <span class=\"popular\">Rula Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ru la mkhar</span> there is an old settlement consisting of 30 to 40 caves hewn out of the earthen formation, which bounds the edge of the valley. As in many other <span class=\"popular\">Gug&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ge</span>locations, these caves are likely to represent an original locus of settlement. </p> <p> <span class=\"popular\">Rula Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ru la mkhar</span> is comprised of a contiguous installation made of blue limestone laid in random-rubble courses. There are also a few adobe-block upper wall fragments. This site is liable to have once formed the social and economic nerve center of the breadbasket of <span class=\"popular\">Rula</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ru la</span>. Its not particularly lofty aspect and the absence of defensive works indicate that it was not a fortress per se, but rather a palace and/or religious complex. Much of <span class=\"popular\">Rula Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ru la mkhar</span> has been leveled o its foundations. The installation has a southeast-northwest axis, in line with the ridge it is poised on. There are two building sectors: southeast/lower and northwest/upper. A 3.5-m tall expanse of rock separates the two sectors. Various wall sections in both sectors contain herringbone courses of masonry. The oral tradition, lack of Buddhist emblems, herringbone stonework, and prominent revetments all indicate that <span class=\"popular\">Rula Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ru la mkhar</span> is an archaic cultural facility. This has been corroborated by the radiocarbon dating of a structural timber extracted from the northwest edifice of the facility. A foundation or reconstruction date of circa 565 to 705 CE is indicated for the northwest edifice of <span class=\"popular\">Rula Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ru la mkhar</span> (see below). The relative position of the dated sample confirms that adobe-block constructions were indeed part of the archaic architectural canon of <span class=\"popular\">Gug&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ge</span>. </p> <h4 id=\"b1-1-93-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>According to a township subdivision headman residing in the village of <span class=\"popular\">Shizh&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Shis bzhad</span>, <span class=\"popular\">Rula Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ru la mkhar</span> long predates the establishment of the region&rsquo;s Buddhist temples and monasteries. The local oral tradition maintains that <span class=\"popular\">Rula</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ru la</span> and the adjoining locales of <span class=\"popular\">Shizh&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Shis bzhad</span> and <span class=\"popular\">Gyad&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Brgya sde</span> once supported sizable, thriving communities. The sheer amount of arable land, ruins and troglodytic settlements in these locations supports this view of history. </p> <h4 id=\"b1-1-93-4\">Site elements</h4> <h5 id=\"b1-1-93-4-1\">Southeast sector</h5> <p>The southeast sector is 35 m in length. Its southeast/downhill side is 6 m wide, while towards the northwest his sector widens to 15 m across. Freestanding wall fragments are no more than 80 cm in height. Revetments add 1 m to 1.5 m of elevation to the structures. Much of the perimeter wall surrounding the southeast sector has been leveled and no interior partition walls have survived. The mud-mortared random-work walls are around 60 cm o 70 cm in thickness. Variable-sized pieces of limestone (up to 70 cm long) were used in construction, but most of the stones are small. The floor plan has been almost totally obliterated. Scant footing fragments suggest hat the southeast sector was divided into at least four sections. The walls flanking the entranceway have a maximum elevation of 2.2 m. These walls extend beyond what must have been the actual opening to the interior, creating an inlet 2.1 m in width. This passageway must have once supported a stairway but all that is left is a natural ramp of stone. On the southwest/exterior wall comprising the inlet, above the 70 cm or 80 cm of freestanding stonework, there are the faint remains of adobe-block courses. These add 20 cm or less to the total height of the wall. The adobe wall traces have been eroded to the point that they are no more than 20 cm in hickness. The inner wall of the inlet reaches 2.5 m in height, including its revetment, the highest elevation structure in the southeast sector. </p> <h5 id=\"b1-1-93-4-2\">Northwest edifice</h5> <p>The northwest or upper sector of <span class=\"popular\">Rula Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ru la mkhar</span> consists of a single edifice (11.5 m x 4 m), which sits atop a highly prominent revetment. The high walls of this edifice and its position at the vertex of the site, suggests that this was the highest status habitation at the site. No interior wall partitions are intact in this stone and adobe structure. The limited structural evidence suggests that it was divided into two rooms: southeast (forward) and northwest (rear). The revetment on the northeast side of the structure attains 2 m in height. The rear or northwest face of the edifice rests upon a revetment with rounded corners, which extends 2 m laterally beyond the superstructure. This unusually designed revetment is 1.8 m in height, and the walls above it add another 1.6 m o the height of the structure. The rear freestanding wall segment is made entirely of adobe blocks, which have been subjected to extreme erosion. Most other freestanding walls fragments are less than 1 m in height. In the southwest corner of the northwest edifice there is a highly degraded adobe wall segment (2.5 m in height) resting upon a high revetment (around 1.8 m in height). </p> <p>At the base of the interior rear wall of the northwest edifice, wood bonding materials are still in situ. I was able to extract a well-preserved piece of <span class=\"popular emph\">drama</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">gra ma</span> wood (15 cm long, 10 cm in circumference) for radiocarbon analysis.<a href=\"#n69\" name=\"nb69\" class=\"note\">69</a> The excellent physical condition of the sample facilitated species identification. This piece of wood was structurally integral to the construction of the adobe-block wall. Along with similar pieces of wood it helped to stabilize the interface between the stone revetment and adobe superstructure. These bonding materials lie perpendicular to the axis of the wall and could be extracted with relative ease and with minimal disturbance o the structure. The sample tested yielded a conventional radiocarbon age of circa 565 to 705 CE, corresponding o the late protohistoric and early imperial periods. Given the relatively small diameter of the piece of wood assayed, it is not likely to have been cut down too many years before it was used in the construction of <span class=\"popular\">Rula Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ru la mkhar</span>. It is likely, therefore, an excellent indicator of when the northwest edifice was either founded or rebuilt. It is possible that rather than reflecting the establishment of the installation, the chronometric evidence may be applicable to a reconstruction process. In any event, adobe-block superstructures are relatively easy to demolish and rebuild. If a foundation date is indicated, it may well reflect chronological values pertinent to the southeast/lower sector of the facility. Both sectors of <span class=\"popular\">Rula Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ru la mkhar</span> share the same ensemble of constructional traits (system of revetting, adobe-block upper courses, random-rubble limestone fabric, and close structural integration). </p> <p>The raising of <span class=\"popular\">Rula Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ru la mkhar</span> is probably linked to the agricultural land-base of its environs, which must have provided the cereal surpluses needed to support an elite monumental and social infrastructure (regional and interregional trade notwithstanding). We can be quite confident, then, that a viable farming community existed at <span class=\"popular\">Rula Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ru la mkhar</span> until at least the seventh or eight century CE. The genesis of agriculture in the area, however, is likely to date to a much more remote period, given the generally more conducive environmental conditions of earlier times and the inherent economic and strategic significance of extensive arable lands. If <span class=\"popular\">Rula Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ru la mkhar</span> was founded before circa 630 CE, it was built as part of an indigenous (<span class=\"popular\">Zhang Zhung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Zhang zhung</span>) polity. A later foundation date (circa 630 to 750 CE) would indicate hat this facility arose within the pan-Tibetan imperium before the reign of King <span class=\"popular\">Tri Songdetsen</span><span class=\"scholar\">Khri srong lde btsan</span>. </p> <h5 id=\"b1-1-93-4-3\">Shrine</h5> <p>Southeast of the residential complex, 15 m lower in elevation, there are the remains of a cubic shrine (1.7 m x 1.7 m). This ceremonial structure shares the same axial alignment as the <span class=\"popular emph\">khar</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mkhar</span>. Probably of the <span class=\"popular emph\">tenkhar</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rten mkhar</span> or <span class=\"popular emph\">sekhar</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">gsas mkhar</span> class, the heavily damaged masonry structure is now 1 m or less in height. This type of monumental form and its relative placement are typical of many Upper Tibetan archaic cultural residential facilities. </p> <h4 id=\"b1-1-93-5\">Affiliated sites</h4> <h5 id=\"b1-1-93-5-1\">Ru la mkhar gog po </h5> <p>The Lamaist complex of rather diminutive size known as <span class=\"popular\">Rulakhar Gokpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ru la mkhar gog po</span> has design features that date it to the 11th to 14th century CE (31&deg; 46.7&#900; N. / 79&deg; 30.5&#900; / 4050 m). It was primarily constructed of adobe blocks in the midst of the <span class=\"popular\">Rula</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ru la</span> agricultural holdings. The faint outlines of aureoles on the walls, auxiliary chapels and outlying <span class=\"popular emph\">Ch&ouml;rten</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mchod rten</span> are some of its more conspicuous features. Although there is some speculation among area residents hat this was a Bon temple, this seems very unlikely given the general religious complexion of <span class=\"popular\">Gug&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ge</span> in the period in which it was built. The existence of a temple at this location may suggest that agriculture persisted at <span class=\"popular\">Rula</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ru la</span> at least until the vestigial period. </p> <h5 id=\"b1-1-93-5-2\">Down-valley settlements</h5> <p>Just down valley from <span class=\"popular\">Rula</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ru la</span> there is the contiguous agricultural settlement of <span class=\"popular\">Gyad&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Brgya sde</span>. It is now totally abandoned. Its name is said to be derived from the 100 households that are supposed to have once lived among its vast farmlands. A small summit stronghold built of earth stands guard over <span class=\"popular\">Gyad&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Brgya sde</span>. It is no longer accessible. <span class=\"popular\">Gyad&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Brgya sde</span> merges with another extensive old agricultural settlement called <span class=\"popular\">Lhakar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Lha dkar</span>. Recently, a residential complex was established here and a small portion of the arable land brought back into production. Down valley from <span class=\"popular\">Lhakar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Lha dkar</span> there is an old agricultural settlement known as <span class=\"popular\">Atsen</span><span class=\"scholar\">A brtsan</span>. Reportedly, a large cave complex and a ruined Buddhist monastery and fortress are found here. Beyond <span class=\"popular\">Atsen</span><span class=\"scholar\">A brtsan</span> the <span class=\"popular\">Shangts&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Shang rtse</span> valley drops off into an uninhabited gorge hat terminates at the <span class=\"popular\">Langchen Tsangpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Glang chen gtsang po</span>.</p> <hr class=\"footnote-divider\"/> <h2>Notes</h2> <div class=\"footnote\"> <a name=\"n69\"/> <a href=\"#nb69\" class=\"note\"> [69] </a> Radiometric, sample no.
