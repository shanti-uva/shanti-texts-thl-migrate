He descended to earth from rTsa gsum lha and preached Bon. Then he went to Zhang zhung rNam rgyal lha rtse. From there he went to the Crystal Cave on Mount Ti se where he practised meditation on the tutelary deity Me ri for three years and so attained the divine body and was called Kri smon lcags kyi bya ru can. At that time, in Zhang zhung, people used to say, \u0026ldquo;In the sky the divine son is beautiful. On earth the king is great.\u0026rdquo; Lha bu\u0026rsquo;s descendants were ancestors of the sPa family and some of its members held the position of prelate at the court of kings of Tibet.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003esPa ston Khyung \u0026rsquo;bar, who had obtained spiritual power of mysticism in the latter stage of Bon development, demonstrated his acquired abilities.

They proceeded from Amdo to the domain of the Hor Ye tha tribe and finally settled there. Their offspring were gYung drung nam bzang, lHun grub grags pa, Shes rab grags pa and Yon tan. gYung drung nam bzang became the prelate of the king of Hor and later he founded sPa tshang Monastery. After that, the centre of activities of the sPa family was shifted from west to east. All Bonpo sources agree that the monastery in Hor Ye tha constituted the most important monastic centre of the sPa lineage.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eLater, sPa ston gYung drung bstan pa \u0026rsquo;brug grags had other assembly halls built, with passages around them, on the three storeys of a building that had one hundred pillars.

They were as high as a three-storey building. There were many small images as well. There was also the temple of bKra shis sgo mang that had twenty-pillars and contained a stupa of bKra shis sgo mang, a giant reliquary stupa and gilt-bronze images of rGyal ba rgya mtsho and sMra seng as tall as a three-storey building. He also had a large number of new religious objects built in the gTso bzhi temple.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe Bonpo doctrine was spread widely through the setting up of a flawless preaching school, under the system of the monastic tradition of sMan ri (No.1) and gYung drung gling (No.2) as well as the teachings of Shar rdza, the one who attained the \u0026ldquo;rainbow-body\u0026rdquo;.

He received the entire course of initiation, transmissions and explanations of Sutra, Tantra and Mind. While practising these three, he also studied and became very learned. He wrote many books, about ten volumes on Bon, and established a school of metaphysical studies in the monastery.
