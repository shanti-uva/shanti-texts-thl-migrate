It was founded in 1847 by sPa ston gYung drung nam bzang, who was of the holy sPa lineage. The sPa is one of the six sacred families: Bru, Zhu, gShen, sPa, rMe&rsquo;u and Khyung. The Bon Sources and some other historical documents give reasons why the sPa family is important:</p> <p>lHa bu sPa ba spa thog, a son of Sangs po and Chu lcam, was born in heaven. He descended to earth from rTsa gsum lha and preached Bon. Then he went to Zhang zhung rNam rgyal lha rtse. From there he went to the Crystal Cave on Mount Ti se where he practised meditation on the tutelary deity Me ri for three years and so attained the divine body and was called Kri smon lcags kyi bya ru can. At that time, in Zhang zhung, people used to say, &ldquo;In the sky the divine son is beautiful. On earth the king is great.&rdquo; Lha bu&rsquo;s descendants were ancestors of the sPa family and some of its members held the position of prelate at the court of kings of Tibet.</p> <p>sPa ston Khyung &rsquo;bar, who had obtained spiritual power of mysticism in the latter stage of Bon development, demonstrated his acquired abilities. He transformed himself into a wrathful deity in order to subdue heretics and into a <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">garuda</span> bird to subdue the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">naga</span> spirits.</p> <p>Other masters who belonged to the sPa family were as prodigious:</p> <ol type=\"1\"> <li> Zhig po Kun rtse</li> <li> Shes rab rgyal mtshan</li> <li> sPa rTogs ldan drang srong</li> <li> sPa ston rGyal ba shes rab</li> <li> sPa ston dPal ldan bzang po</li> <li> Nyi dpal bzang po</li> </ol> <p>There were other masters of the sPa lineage who were based at La phug in Western Tibet called the &ldquo;Thirteen good masters&rdquo; (sPa bla bzang po bcu gsum); to name six of them, we have the following:</p> <ol type=\"1\"> <li> Zla rgyal bzang po</li> <li> sTobs chen bzang po</li> <li> dPal mchog bzang po</li> <li> dPal &rsquo;bar bzang po</li> <li> mKhas grub Nam mkha&rsquo; bzang po</li> <li> gYung drung bzang po</li> </ol> <p>However, their seat in Western Tibet declined and some members of the family migrated to mDo smad.</p> <p>One of these was sPa ston gYung drung rgyal po, who had two sons: dGra &rsquo;dul bstan rgyal and bSod nams dbang grags. They proceeded from Amdo to the domain of the Hor Ye tha tribe and finally settled there. Their offspring were gYung drung nam bzang, lHun grub grags pa, Shes rab grags pa and Yon tan. gYung drung nam bzang became the prelate of the king of Hor and later he founded sPa tshang Monastery. After that, the centre of activities of the sPa family was shifted from west to east. All Bonpo sources agree that the monastery in Hor Ye tha constituted the most important monastic centre of the sPa lineage.</p> <p>Later, sPa ston gYung drung bstan pa &rsquo;brug grags had other assembly halls built, with passages around them, on the three storeys of a building that had one hundred pillars. He also had the following religious objects erected: a stupa of bDud &rsquo;dul sgra sgrags, and statues of sTon pa rdzogs sku and rNam par rgyal ba, all gilt-bronze works. They were as high as a three-storey building. There were many small images as well. There was also the temple of bKra shis sgo mang that had twenty-pillars and contained a stupa of bKra shis sgo mang, a giant reliquary stupa and gilt-bronze images of rGyal ba rgya mtsho and sMra seng as tall as a three-storey building. He also had a large number of new religious objects built in the gTso bzhi temple.</p> <p>The Bonpo doctrine was spread widely through the setting up of a flawless preaching school, under the system of the monastic tradition of sMan ri (No.1) and gYung drung gling (No.2) as well as the teachings of Shar rdza, the one who attained the &ldquo;rainbow-body&rdquo;. Thus the members of the sPa family made the Bon religion flourish there.</p> <p>The lineage of the masters of sPa tshang Monastery in Ye tha is as follows:</p> <ol type=\"1\"> <li> sPa gYung drung nam bzang</li> <li> sPa ston Nam mkha&rsquo; sgrol gsal</li> <li> sPa ston Nyi ma &rsquo;bum gsal</li> <li> sPa ston gYung drung bstan pa &rsquo;brug grags (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">alias</span> &rsquo;Brug Rinpoche)</li> <li> sPa bsTan pa rgyal mtshan (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">alias</span> Nyi &rsquo;bum sprul sku)</li> <li> sPla Zla ba rgyal mtshan</li> <li> bsTan pa &rsquo;brug grags</li> <li> Kho bo rTog ldan Shes rab phun tshogs</li> </ol> <p>The last master did not belong to the lineage of the sPa family, but observed the rules of monastic discipline according to the sPa tradition.</p> <p>Among the above-mentioned lamas, Nyi ma &rsquo;bum gsal, who was very active in the development process of the monastery, is described in some historical documents as follows:</p> <p>He was born in 1825. He took full ordination in the presence of Zhu ston rGyal mtshan nyi ma and mKhan chen sKal bzang bstan pa&rsquo;i nyi ma and heard teachings from these masters. He acquired an extraordinary knowledge of Buddhism and Bon under the tutelage of Me ston Nyi ma rgyal mtshan, &rsquo;Gro mgon Shes rab g-yung drung, Grub dbang bsTan &rsquo;dzin rin chen and gTer ston Tshe dbang grags pa. As mentioned above, he had temples built and various statues made as well as making copies of the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">bKa&rsquo; &rsquo;gyur</span> and <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">bKa&rsquo;</span> <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">bren</span>. Having established the practice of preaching and meditating, he passed away at the age of sixty-seven.</p> <p>Another important figure in the development of sPa tshang Monastery was gYung drung bstan pa &rsquo;brug grags. He was born in 1832. He took ordination at an early age in the presence of his paternal uncle, Nyi ma &rsquo;bum gsal. He received the entire course of initiation, transmissions and explanations of Sutra, Tantra and Mind. While practising these three, he also studied and became very learned. He wrote many books, about ten volumes on Bon, and established a school of metaphysical studies in the monastery. He had a gilt stupa of bKra shis sgo mang built, and another stupa of bDud &rsquo;dul sgra sgrags, as mentioned above. His deeds and name came to be known all around, and he passed away at the age of sixty.</p> <h5 id=\"b5-1-5-1-1\">Annual Religious Services and Rituals</h5> <ol type=\"1\"> <li> At the end of the eleventh Tibetan month the ritual of sTag la me &rsquo;bar was performed for five days.</li> <li> In the twelfth month, at the end of the year, the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">dgu chen</span> ritual based on the ritual cycles of Kho bo and Phur pa was performed over seven days, and on the 30th day the ceremony of confession was held.</li> <li> In the first month flower offerings, A dkar bum sgrub and bCo lnga mchod pa were performed, occupying seventeen days in all.</li> <li> In the second month the ritual based on the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">mKha&rsquo; klong gsang mdos</span> was performed for nine days.</li> <li> In the third month Dus chen che mo was performed for seventeen days, as well as religious dances (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">dbang &rsquo;cham</span>) and the ritual based on the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">Rig &rsquo;dzin gsang sgrub</span>.</li> <li> In the sixth month the rituals of Ma rgyud and rNam rgyal were performed and the summer retreat was observed for seventeen days.</li> <li> In the seventh month the ritual based on the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">Zhi khro</span> was performed for fourteen days.</li> <li> In the eighth month the ritual of Ma tri bum sgrub was performed for nine days and there were religious dances.</li> <li> In the tenth month a debate on metaphysics was conducted for ten days.</li> </ol> <p>The organization of the monastery at that time consisted of the following:</p> <ul xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" class=\"bullet-blue\"> <li> <span style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">mkhan po</span> </li> <li> <span style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">dpon slob</span> </li> <li> <span style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"> dbu mdzad</span> </li> <li> <span style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">dge bskos</span> </li> <li> <span style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">grwa dpon</span> </li> <li> <span style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">phyag mdzod</span> </li> <li> <span style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">spyi gso</span> </li> <li> <span style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"> gnyer pa</span> </li> </ul> <p>There were 250 monks in the monastery.</p> <p>In the assembly hall and at its porch, there were excellent murals of deities.

All this vividly shows the particular tradition of the Bonpo tradition.</p> <p>sPa tshang Monastery in Hor Ye tha was an important seat of the sPa family, and it still plays an important role as the centre of the sPa tradition. At present, this monastery&rsquo;s chief lamas are Kho bo rTogs ldan Shes rab phun tshogs, bsTan pa &rsquo;brug grags and Nam mkha&rsquo; dbang grub. sKal bzang dbang grags, the aged dance master of sPa tshang Monastery, is very skilled in the art of the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">&rsquo;cham</span> dance. Twice a year, therefore, they customarily perform religious dances. They maintain the art of <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">&rsquo;cham</span> well and have good costumes for it. In fact, we saw the staging of the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">&rsquo;cham</span> dance based on the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">Rig &rsquo;dzin gsang sgrub</span>, which consists of several dances, such as gSer skyem, mTshams bcad, sPyan &rsquo;bebs, sPyan &rsquo;dren, rNam brgyad tshogs &rsquo;cham, sKu bstod, Nang &rsquo;cham and others. These are of the Bonpo tradition but have unique features. The present sPa tshang Monastery has over one hundred monks, and the religious activities are kept in the way they used to be.</p> <table xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\" class=\"navarrows\"><tbody><tr><td class=\"leftcell\"><a class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"><img src=\"/global/images/arrow-left.gif\" title=\"Previous Section\"/></a></td><td class=\"midcell\"><a class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"><img src=\"/global/images/arrow-up.gif\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"/></a></td><td class=\"rightcell\"><a class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"><img src=\"/global/images/arrow-right.gif\" title=\"Next Section\"/></a></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div id=\"chap-id\">/bonpo-monasteries/b5-1-5-1/</div><div style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\" class=\"jqmWindow\" id=\"chapRefWindow\"><div class=\"closebtn\"><a href=\"#\">Close</a></div><div style=\"height: 280px;\" class=\"conx-content\"><h3>Note Citation for Page <span class=\"pgnm\"/></h3><p class=\"biblref\">Dondrup Lhagyal, Phuntso Tsering Sharyul, Tsering Thar, Charles Ramble, and Marietta Kind, A Survey of Bonpo Monasteries and Temples in Tibet and the Himalaya (ISBN: , :, 2010-07-06), <span class=\"pgnm\"/>. </p><h3>Bibliographic Citation</h3><p>Dondrup Lhagyal, Phuntso Tsering Sharyul, Tsering Thar, Charles Ramble, and Marietta Kind.
