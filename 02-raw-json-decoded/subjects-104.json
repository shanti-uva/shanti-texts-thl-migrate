In the \"Historical buildings in Lhasa\" table at the back of the book (pp. 165-172), buildings of the \"Monastery\" type are designated with the letter \"C\" in the building type column. In the THL Place Dictionary, when a building has this feature type and the \u003cem\u003eLhasa Atlas\u003c/em\u003e is given as the source, it means that the building was designated with a \"C\" in the \u003cem\u003eLhasa Atlas\u003c/em\u003e table.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThis building type is described as follows:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\"\u003cem\u003eC.

The northern wing functions as the main building with three to four floors and with one or two separate temples. The main building is attached at both ends to the side wings over two floors, with monks' cells reached from a gallery. The layout is symmetrical, with the entrance normally through a gate in the centre of the south wing. A monastery can also be integrated into a temple complex, in which case it is adapted to the overall layout of the temple\" (p. 60).\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSource:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eLarsen, Knud and Amund Sinding-Larsen. \u003cem\u003eThe Lhasa Atlas: Traditional Tibetan Architecture and Townscape\u003c/em\u003e.
