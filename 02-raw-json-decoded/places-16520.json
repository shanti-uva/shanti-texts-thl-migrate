These are effluents of the <span class=\"popular\">Rusum</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ru gsum</span>, a valley system rich in archaic cultural horizon archaeological sites (see A-84, A-85, A-86, A-88, A-89, B-34, B-35, B-36, B-79, B-80, B-81). This inherently defendable stronghold is suspended in the crags, 110 m above the valley floor. The site coincides with he demarcation of the upper extent of agriculture in the <span class=\"popular\">Sherang</span><span class=\"scholar\">She rang</span> valley and the higher pastoral lands. Like <span class=\"popular\">Kharpoche</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mkhar po che</span> (A-86), spo sa mkhar (A-84) and other summit installations in <span class=\"popular\">Derok</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sde rog</span> township, this fortress must have been established to rule over and protect a local community. </p> <h4 id=\"b1-1-39-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>According to residents of <span class=\"popular\">Rusum</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ru gsum</span>, she rang mkhar gog was a <span class=\"popular\">Kel M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Skal mon</span> (an aboriginal tribe) castle.</p> <h4 id=\"b1-1-39-4\">Site elements</h4> <h5 id=\"b1-1-39-4-1\">Castle</h5> <p>The easiest access to the facility is via the north side of the ridge-spur. The stronghold (10.8 m x 5.8 m) was built at two levels. In most places it has been reduced to its revetments and footings. The maximum height of he revetments is 2 m. The higher south tier is separated from the north tier by a 1.5 m vertical rise. The ingression is in the north, between walls inset 2 m into the structure, creating an inlet. This design feature is reminiscent of the entryways of <span class=\"popular\">Ha La Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ha la mkhar</span> West (A-58) and <span class=\"popular\">Naktsuk Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Nag gtsug mkhar</span> (A-57), in <span class=\"popular\">Gug&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ge</span>. The outer opening of this inlet is 1.8 m in width and the inner access is 90 cm across. The vertical distance between the outer and inner thresholds of the ingress is 1.5 m, thus stairs must have been built to span this height. The heavy walls of the inlet rise to an elevation of 2 m. The entry between the two levels of the building is in the west and is set in an interclose, 1.8 m in length. An 80-cm long threshold stone stretches across this entrance. Most of the mud-mortar has washed out of the random-rubble walls. A bluish metamorphic stone, which has weathered to a brown color, was used in construction. These roughly dressed stones are primarily 20 cm to 70 cm in length, and the walls are around 50 cm in thickness. </p> <table cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\" class=\"navarrows\"> <tbody> <tr> <td class=\"leftcell\"> <a class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-left.gif\" title=\"Previous Section\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"midcell\"> <a class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-up.gif\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"rightcell\"> <a class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-right.gif\" title=\"Next Section\"/> </a> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div id=\"chap-id\">/bellezza/b1-1-39/</div> <div style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\" class=\"jqmWindow\" id=\"chapRefWindow\"> <div class=\"closebtn\"> <a href=\"#\">Close</a> </div> <div style=\"height: 280px;\" class=\"conx-content\"> <h3>Note Citation for Page <span class=\"pgnm\"/> </h3> <p class=\"biblref\">John Vincent Bellezza, Antiquities of Zhang Zhung: A Comprehensive Inventory of Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Monuments on he Tibetan Upland (Charlottesville, VA 22904:Tibetan &amp; Himalayan Library, 2010), <span class=\"pgnm\"/>. </p> <h3>Bibliographic Citation</h3> <p>John Vincent Bellezza.
