With its many salt and soda flats, this was an attractive location for the placement of ritual and utilitarian facilities pertaining to the disposal of human remains. I refer to this area as the &lsquo;Valley of the Dead&rsquo; because of the concentration of funerary sites found here (see C-92, C-153, D-46, D-68). All of these sites have especially long views in the east. The extreme aridity of the area, rendering much of it uninhabitable and of little value to livestock, would appear to account for the concentration of funerary sites in the Valley of he Dead. The closest archaic residential site to this cluster of ceremonial sites surveyed is <span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n Khar Sernak</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon mkhar ser nag</span> (A-30), located 20 km to the west. The precise chronological and cultural relationships between the various Valley of the Dead funerary sites have yet to be determined. <span class=\"popular\">Naklh&eacute; Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Nag lhas rdo ring</span> is named for the small, dark conical formation standing on the western edge of the <span class=\"popular\">Tsatsa Kha</span><span class=\"scholar\">Tshwa tshwa kha</span> basin. There are three individual archaeological installations at <span class=\"popular\">Naklh&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Nag lhas</span>: two of stelae erected inside enclosures and one consisting of quadrate enclosures. The three sites of <span class=\"popular\">Naklh&eacute; Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Nag lhas rdo ring</span> are all in eyeshot of one another.</p> <h4 id=\"b2-1-17-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>It is generally thought in this region (<span class=\"popular\">Gegy&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dge rgyas</span>) that sites such as <span class=\"popular\">Naklh&eacute; Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Nag lhas rdo ring</span> were constructed by the ancient <span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span> for burial purposes.</p> <h4 id=\"b2-1-17-4\">Site elements </h4> <h5 id=\"b2-1-17-4-1\">Nag lhas rdo ring Northeast</h5> <p> <span class=\"popular\">Naklh&eacute; Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Nag lhas rdo ring</span> Northeast consists of a row of nine in situ pillars, situated near the shores of the alkaline lake <span class=\"popular\">Tsatsa Kha</span><span class=\"scholar\">Tshwa tshwa kha</span> (32&deg; 37.278&#900; N. lat. / 81.52.428&#900; E. long. / 4450 m).<a href=\"#n31\" name=\"nb31\" class=\"note\">31</a> </p> <h6 class=\"essay\">Enclosure</h6> <p>The walls enclosing these pillars are highly fragmentary and their original configuration could not be determined with any precision. Quite an anomaly, the row of pillars (many of which are inclined) appears to stand near the east end of the enclosure. The west wall of the enclosure is situated 26 m west of the pillars. The extant west wall fragment is about 15 m long and fairly well aligned in the cardinal directions. This wall is double-course (40 cm to 50 cm thick), and contains variable-length (10 cm to 70 cm long) stones. The stones of the west wall are flush with the ground surface or project above up to a height of 20 cm. A small fragment of the enclosing north wall is also intact where it joins with the west wall. The area between the row of pillars and west wall of the enclosure is strewn with small pieces of white limestone. These stones either formed an element of the construction or were once part of votive offerings. Inside the enclosure, 5.8 m west of the row of pillars, there is a smaller enclosure (2.2 m x 2.4 m) or cell. This inner enclosure is offset owards the north side of the larger enclosure. The single-course perimeter walls of the smaller enclosure are composed of calcareous rocks up to 60 cm in length. These stones project as much as 30 cm above ground level. The smaller enclosure is of crude construction and sub-rectangular in form. This is one of the only examples of the stelae erected inside an enclosure typology (II.1b) that has a subsidiary inner enclosure discovered to date. </p> <h6 class=\"essay\">Pillars </h6> <p>Five of the nine in situ pillars planted inside the enclosure are broken to varying degrees, and now stand 60 cm to 1 m in height. These broken pillars are all irregularly shaped. There are also two fallen pillars, 1.3 m and 1.4 m in length. All the pillars (except one) are made of an unhewn light-colored, grained igneous (?) rock. From south to north, the dimensions and characteristics of the four unbroken stelae are as follows:</p> <ol> <li>Long-stone DR1: four-sided (1.2 m [height] x 85 cm [basal girth]).</li> <li>Long-stone DR2: a tabular dark-colored stone (1 m x 70 cm).</li> <li>Long-stone DR3: four-sided (1.5 m x 1 m).</li> <li>Long-stone DR4: four-sided (1.25 m x 1 m). </li> </ol> <h5 id=\"b2-1-17-4-2\">Nag lhas rdo ring Southwest</h5> <p> <span class=\"popular\">Naklh&eacute; Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Nag lhas rdo ring</span>Southwest is situated about one-half km from <span class=\"popular\">Naklh&eacute; Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Nag lhas rdo ring</span>Northeast, in close proximity to the <span class=\"popular\">Naklh&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Nag lhas</span> rock formation (37.083&#900; / 52.338&#900; / 4460 m). The sandy terrain is nearly level and strewn with dark blue grained rocks that have reddish-colored varnish. This is the type rock with which the monument was constructed. <span class=\"popular\">Naklh&eacute; Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Nag lhas rdo ring</span>Southwest is a conventional example of the II.2 typology. </p> <h6 class=\"essay\">Enclosure</h6> <p>The enclosure is aligned in the cardinal directions, and measures 11.4 m (east-west) x 7 m (north-south). The east, west and south walls of the enclosure are largely intact, while the north wall is highly fragmentary. These double-course walls (65 cm to 80 cm thick) are composed of stones (primarily 40 cm to 60 cm long) that are even with the ground level or elevated up to 20 cm above it. </p> <h6 class=\"essay\">Pillar</h6> <p>There is a single, irregularly shaped, pillar (approximately 1 m in height) erected inside the enclosure. The pillar stands next to the inner edge of the west wall and is quite well centered between its north and south walls of the enclosure. There are also three or four partly submerged larger stones inside the enclosure. These appear to have been smaller pillars. </p> <h6 class=\"essay\">Outlying funerary structure</h6> <p>A square structure (2.1 m x 2.2 m) is located 7.5 m directly west of the west wall of the <span class=\"popular\">Naklh&eacute; Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Nag lhas rdo ring</span>Southwest enclosure, at slightly higher elevation. The base of this structure is made of large rocks upon which smaller stones are heaped. This probable funerary structure is elevated about 1 m above the surrounding ground level.</p> <h5 id=\"b2-1-17-4-3\">Interconnected funerary superstructures </h5> <p>At <span class=\"popular\">Naklh&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Nag lhas</span> there is a third site, consisting of at least seven large rectangular funerary enclosures, located a couple hundred meters north of <span class=\"popular\">Naklh&eacute; Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Nag lhas rdo ring</span>Southwest (37.17&#900; / 52.29&#900; / 4460 m). These structures are situated on level sandy ground in the mouth of a small side valley. This interconnected line of enclosures (with the possible exception of two structures that may have had spaces between them) is 82 m in length. Forming a single north-south line, these enclosures are about 13 m wide (east-west). As these structures are highly deteriorated, a detailed assessment of their design and construction qualities was not possible. The walls of the enclosures do not seem to be well aligned in the cardinal directions. Variable-length (primarily 25 cm to 50 cm long) stones of the type used to build <span class=\"popular\">Naklh&eacute; Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Nag lhas rdo ring</span>Southwest were used in the construction of the walls. Some enclosure walls also exhibit chunks of a white calcareous stone but this is the exception. The largest stones in the construction reach 1 m in length. The stones of the enclosures tend to project 10 cm to 30 cm above ground level. The enclosures all appear to have been free from interior structural elements. This <span class=\"popular\">Naklh&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Nag lhas</span> site with its interconnected line of enclosures somewhat resembles funerary structure FS4 of <span class=\"popular\">Zangdong M&ouml;ndo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Zangs gdong mon rdo</span> (C-170). </p> <p>Approximately 50 m west of the interconnected enclosure complex there are the remains of a wall (8.5 m long, 1.2 m thick, 60 cm high). Farther west there is other minor structural detritus. </p> <hr class=\"footnote-divider\"/> <h2>Notes</h2> <div class=\"footnote\"> <a name=\"n31\"/> <a href=\"#nb31\" class=\"note\"> [31] </a> This lake and basin is not to be confused with the much better known and larger <span class=\"popular\">Tsakha Tsatso</span><span class=\"scholar\">Tshwa kha tshwa mtsho</span> located near the <span class=\"popular\">Tsakha</span><span class=\"scholar\">Tshwa kha</span> township headquarters.
