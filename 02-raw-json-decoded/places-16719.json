The site is set in the middle of a plain and has long views in all directions. The tip of the holy mountain, gangs dkar ti se, is visible 50 km o the northeast. A cross-section of the Uttaranchal Himalaya can be seen in he southwest. The terrain is level, sandy and turf-covered. <span class=\"popular\">Rinchen Chund&eacute; Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rin chen chu &rsquo;ded rdo ring</span> consists of a typical example of pillars erected inside an enclosure. </p> <h4 id=\"b2-1-77-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>Local sources report that <span class=\"popular\">Rinchen Chund&eacute; Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rin chen chu &rsquo;ded rdo ring</span> is an ancient monument.</p> <h4 id=\"b2-1-77-4\">Site elements</h4> <h5 id=\"b2-1-77-4-1\">Enclosure</h5> <p>The enclosure is aligned in the cardinal directions, and measures 9.4 m (east-west) x 8 m (north-south). Although parts of all four walls are discernable, they are in a state of advanced disintegration. These walls are composed of variable-length (10 cm to 40 cm long) blocky pieces of gray limestone and a harder brown rock. The ground on the east end of the enclosure is uneven. On the west end of the enclosure there is a rise of about 1 m, which can probably be attributed to localized geomorphologic changes. The north side of the enclosure is partly overgrown with <span class=\"popular emph\">drama</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">gra ma</span> brush. </p> <h5 id=\"b2-1-77-4-2\">Pillars</h5> <p>Close to what was the west wall of the enclosure there is a white tabular pillar (1.2 m [height] x 1.2 m [basal girth]). The two broad sides of the standing stone are oriented north and south. This highly worn menhir (Long-stone DR1) is discolored in places. The pillar is not well centered in the enclosure; it was at least one of two main pillars near the west wall. The other main pillar is dislodged and lies just outside the enclosure. It is a well-formed four-sided white specimen (1.2 m long x 70 cm girth). Along the west wall, near the north side of the enclosure, there are also two small broken dark-colored pillars. They now stand 20 cm in height. Beside DR1 there is a broken inscribed <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma &#7751;i</span> plaque.</p> <p>A small wall fragment of what appears to be a vestige of a funerary enclosure is situated 2 m east of the pillar enclosure. </p> <table cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\" class=\"navarrows\"> <tbody> <tr> <td class=\"leftcell\"> <a class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-left.gif\" title=\"Previous Section\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"midcell\"> <a class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-up.gif\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"rightcell\"> <a class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-right.gif\" title=\"Next Section\"/> </a> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div id=\"chap-id\">/bellezza2/b2-1-77/</div> <div style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\" class=\"jqmWindow\" id=\"chapRefWindow\"> <div class=\"closebtn\"> <a href=\"#\">Close</a> </div> <div style=\"height: 280px;\" class=\"conx-content\"> <h3>Note Citation for Page <span class=\"pgnm\"/> </h3> <p class=\"biblref\">John Vincent Bellezza, Antiquities of Zhang Zhung: A Comprehensive Inventory of Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Monuments on he Tibetan Upland (Charlottesville, VA 22904:Tibetan &amp; Himalayan Library, 2010), <span class=\"pgnm\"/>. </p> <h3>Bibliographic Citation</h3> <p>John Vincent Bellezza.
