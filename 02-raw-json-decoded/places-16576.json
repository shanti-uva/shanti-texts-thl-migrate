Only faint structural remains exist of what is locally believed to have been a Buddhist monastery (it may have been inherited from he Bonpo). Even most of the foundation walls have been eradicated. The structural vestiges are spread over an area of approximately 24 m x 11 m around the mouth of the cave. It appears that this cave was completely enclosed by walls. Only a small segment of the south wall has survived. This random-rubble structure is about 2 m tall and 70 cm in thickness. There are possibly structural extensions to the west, the direction of a now disused corral. Against a smaller outcrop, 72 m north of <span class=\"popular\">B&ouml;npo Puk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bon po phug</span>, there are the obscured remains of foundations measuring 18 m x 5.5 m. There are old <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma &#7751;i</span> plaques at <span class=\"popular\">B&ouml;npo Puk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bon po phug</span>, confirming that it was at least symbolically occupied by the Buddhists. In the mouth of the valley in which the site is located, there is a wall with centuries-old inscribed plaques. </p> <h4 id=\"b1-2-1-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>According to local elders, <span class=\"popular\">B&ouml;npo Puk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bon po phug</span> is a Bonpo cave that came to be occupied by the <span class=\"popular emph\">sakyapa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">sa skya pa</span>, who built a small monastery here.</p> <h4 id=\"b1-2-1-4\">Textual tradition</h4> <p>The area around <span class=\"popular\">Pori Ngeden</span><span class=\"scholar\">Spos ri ngad ldan</span> is supposed to be particularly rich in archaic ruins.
