Directly south and 150 m below the site is the sacred freshwater lake, <span class=\"popular\">Mukyu Tso</span><span class=\"scholar\">Smu skyu mtsho</span>/<span class=\"popular\">Mokyu Tso</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rmo khyu mtsho</span> (Bevy of Grandmothers Lake). To the east is the <span class=\"popular\">Ngorang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sngo rang</span> valley and to the west is a mountain known as <span class=\"popular\">Gonyis</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mgo gnyis</span> (Two Heads). The view north is cut off by the <span class=\"popular\">Tseda</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rtse mda&rsquo;</span>mountain. The errain is turf-covered, sandy and gently sloping. There are three or four funerary enclosures at <span class=\"popular\">Tseda</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rtse mda&rsquo;</span> that are probably best classified under the heaped-stone wall typology. They variously exhibit irregular forms, tops inset below the upper slope, gentle slope gradients, and traces of piled stones walls; traits associated with heaped-stone wall enclosures. </p> <p>The funerary structures of <span class=\"popular\">Tseda</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rtse mda&rsquo;</span> also have morphological qualities associated with the terraced tombs of the far eastern <span class=\"popular\">Jangtang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Byang thang</span> (elevated forward flanks, flat tops and low elevation amorphous walls). The terraced tombs, however, appear to have had a weaker influence on the design and construction of <span class=\"popular\">Tseda</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rtse mda&rsquo;</span> than the heaped-stone wall enclosures. Nonetheless, only subsurface investigations can definitively chart the typological affinities of the <span class=\"popular\">Tseda</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rtse mda&rsquo;</span> funerary structures. The perimeter walls (around 70 cm thick) are generally in a very poor state of preservation, and have been reduced to only 10 cm to 20 cm height. Although the surface of the structures now inclines in conformity with the slope gradient, it is likely hat they were once completely level. These funerary structures were built of variable-length (10 cm to 60 cm long) pieces of red volcanic rock. Heaped-stone wall enclosures are widespread to the west all the way across the <span class=\"popular\">Jangtang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Byang thang</span>. Such structures are closely associated with the ancient <span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span> in the oral radition of the region. There are no signs that <span class=\"popular\">Tseda</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rtse mda&rsquo;</span> has been recently disturbed. </p> <h4 id=\"b2-2-44-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>The structures of <span class=\"popular\">Tseda</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rtse mda&rsquo;</span> are locally referred o as <span class=\"popular emph\">m&ouml;ndo ra</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mon rdo ra</span> (Stone Enclosures of the <span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span>). These are supposed to be ancient <span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span> habitations that were built when the level of mu skyu mtsho was much higher.</p> <h4 id=\"b2-2-44-4\">Site elements</h4> <p>The structures of <span class=\"popular\">Tseda</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rtse mda&rsquo;</span> have the following dimensions, locations and salient features:</p> <ol> <li>Funerary structure FS1 (7.3 m x 5 m) is missing an east wall and is now U-shaped. </li> <li>Funerary structure FS2 is situated 1.6 m north of FS1. It consists of a single sinuous wall fragment 11.5 m in length. If this wall was originally part of an enclosure, as seems likely, all other traces of it have disappeared. </li> <li>Funerary structure FS3 (9 m x 10.6 m) is an ovoid enclosure with an elevated forward flank situated 5.5 m east of FS2. It is the only complete enclosure at <span class=\"popular\">Tseda</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rtse mda&rsquo;</span>.</li> <li>Funerary structure FS4 (5 m across) is situated 9 m northeast of FS3. The upper part of its perimeter wall is missing. The forward flank of FS4 is prominently elevated above the downhill slope. </li> </ol> <table cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\" class=\"navarrows\"> <tbody> <tr> <td class=\"leftcell\"> <a class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-left.gif\" title=\"Previous Section\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"midcell\"> <a class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-up.gif\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"rightcell\"> <a class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-right.gif\" title=\"Next Section\"/> </a> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div id=\"chap-id\">/bellezza2/b2-2-44/</div> <div style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\" class=\"jqmWindow\" id=\"chapRefWindow\"> <div class=\"closebtn\"> <a href=\"#\">Close</a> </div> <div style=\"height: 280px;\" class=\"conx-content\"> <h3>Note Citation for Page <span class=\"pgnm\"/> </h3> <p class=\"biblref\">John Vincent Bellezza, Antiquities of Zhang Zhung: A Comprehensive Inventory of Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Monuments on he Tibetan Upland (Charlottesville, VA 22904:Tibetan &amp; Himalayan Library, 2010), <span class=\"pgnm\"/>. </p> <h3>Bibliographic Citation</h3> <p>John Vincent Bellezza.
