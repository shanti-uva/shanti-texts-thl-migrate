These dry-mortared random-rubble walls of <span class=\"popular\">Yilung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dbyi lung</span> run along the steep flanks of a rocky ridge. These structures are up to 1 m in height, and must have been used in the defense of the <span class=\"popular\">Yilung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dbyi lung</span> valley. The site is divided by a cliff and a gap of approximately 100 m into south and north sectors. </p> <h4 id=\"b1-1-40-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>According to <span class=\"popular\">Rusum</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ru gsum</span> residents, the <span class=\"popular\">Yilung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dbyi lung</span> ruins are that of an ancient <span class=\"popular\">Kel M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Skal mon</span> stronghold.</p> <h4 id=\"b1-1-40-4\">Site elements</h4> <h5 id=\"b1-1-40-4-1\">South sector</h5> <p>The south sector is dominated by a wall 60 m in length, enclosing an uneven terrace 4 m to 6 m wide. This wall is made of granite boulders covered in orange climax lichen, some of which are more than 1 m in length. At a slightly lower elevation there are the remnants of a much smaller wall. A cleft in the face of the cliff above he terrace may have once afforded shelter.</p> <h5 id=\"b1-1-40-4-2\">North sector</h5> <p>The north sector also consists of one main wall that enclosed a level area cut into the slope. The wall is 40 m in length, and is best preserved along its middle section. Much of what was the terrace behind the rampart has been obliterated by the failure of the slope. To have fully enclosed this section of the ridge, this wall would have had to extend 20 m more to the edge of a cliff, but no signs of such a wall section are visible. About 30 m above the defensive wall there is a cave (11 m x 10 m) with at least a 5-m high ceiling. Around its mouth are he vestiges of a fa&ccedil;ade, which appears to have small bits of mud plaster sticking to it. The remnants of masonry adhering to the mouth of the cave indicate that this wall was at least 4 m in height. The habitation of his cave is likely to have been associated with the defensive walls below. </p> <table cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\" class=\"navarrows\"> <tbody> <tr> <td class=\"leftcell\"> <a class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-left.gif\" title=\"Previous Section\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"midcell\"> <a class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-up.gif\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"rightcell\"> <a class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-right.gif\" title=\"Next Section\"/> </a> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div id=\"chap-id\">/bellezza/b1-1-40/</div> <div style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\" class=\"jqmWindow\" id=\"chapRefWindow\"> <div class=\"closebtn\"> <a href=\"#\">Close</a> </div> <div style=\"height: 280px;\" class=\"conx-content\"> <h3>Note Citation for Page <span class=\"pgnm\"/> </h3> <p class=\"biblref\">John Vincent Bellezza, Antiquities of Zhang Zhung: A Comprehensive Inventory of Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Monuments on he Tibetan Upland (Charlottesville, VA 22904:Tibetan &amp; Himalayan Library, 2010), <span class=\"pgnm\"/>. </p> <h3>Bibliographic Citation</h3> <p>John Vincent Bellezza.
