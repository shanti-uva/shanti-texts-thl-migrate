The site overlooks a vast plain to the east. There are also long views in the north and south (in the direction of the Great Central Himalaya). <span class=\"popular\">Jo Ri Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Jo ri rdo ring</span>is found on a broad grassy and sandy slope, which gives way to steeper slopes in the west. It consists of three main pillars standing inside an enclosure. </p> <h4 id=\"b2-1-108-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>According to a local folktale, the mountain god <span class=\"popular\">Jo Ri</span><span class=\"scholar\">Jo ri</span> (a btsan spirit) tied his dog to the pillars of <span class=\"popular\">Jo Ri Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Jo ri rdo ring</span>. </p> <h4 id=\"b2-1-108-4\">Site elements</h4> <h5 id=\"b2-1-108-4-1\">Enclosure</h5> <p>The enclosure is roughly aligned in the cardinal directions, and measures 8 m (east-west) x 5.7 m (north-south). Only small fragments of the walls of the enclosure have endured. The enclosure is so degraded hat the composition of its walls is no longer discernable, but they are most likely to have been double-course. A grayish and brownish metamorphic (?) rock of variable length (20 cm to 70 cm long) was used to construct the enclosure. In order to maintain a level interior, the east wall of the enclosure is elevated about 50 cm above he downhill slope. There is a well-centered opening (75 cm wide) in the east wall, which is demarcated by two large stones that are set perpendicular to the wall course. These threshold stones are 80 cm long with a maximum projection of 40 cm from the ground surface and 50 cm long with a 20 cm projection. There is virtually nothing left of the west wall. It appears to have been laid within 1 m of the pillars. There is also very little remaining of the south and north walls of the enclosure. Many smaller stones (5 cm to 15 cm long) are scattered about the interior of the enclosure. These stones must have been an integral part of the structure at one time. </p> <h5 id=\"b2-1-108-4-2\">Pillars</h5> <p>There are three pillars inside the enclosure, the middle one being the tallest among them. These pillars are grayish to brownish in color and are heavily worn and darkened. The pillars have the following dimensions and characteristics:</p> <p>South pillar: a metamorphic rock of four uneven sides, (70 cm [height] x 1.1 m [basal girth]). Just north of he south pillar there is a small broken pillar (20 cm x 70 cm).</p> <p>Central pillar: a sedimentary tabular rock whose broad sides are oriented north and south, (1.6 m x 1.3 m). The central pillar is situated 1.4 m north of the south pillar.</p> <p>North pillar: a gray crystalline irregularly shaped rock (80 cm x 1.6 m). The north pillar is situated 80 cm north of the central pillar.</p> <h4 id=\"b2-1-108-5\">Affiliated sites</h4> <h5 id=\"b2-1-108-5-1\">Jo ri btsan khang</h5> <p>Higher up the west flanks of <span class=\"popular\">Jo Ri</span><span class=\"scholar\">Jo ri</span> there is a ruined Buddhist monastic facility known as <span class=\"popular\">Jo Ri Tsenkhang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Jo ri btsan khang</span> (30&deg; 04.6&#900; N. lat. / 83&deg; 05.7&#900; E. long. / 4870 m). This <span class=\"popular emph\">Nyingma</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rnying ma</span> institution was destroyed in the Chinese Cultural Revolution. It has never been rebuilt, despite there being no other monastic centers in <span class=\"popular\">Horpa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Hor pa</span>. This smaller monastic complex was built just below a line of red crags. The core of the site is the <span class=\"popular\">Jo Ri Tsenkhang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Jo ri btsan khang</span> cave, which is located behind what was the main building of the site (contained a chapel, lama&rsquo;s residence and kitchen). It is reported that a stone pillar used to stand inside this cave. <span class=\"popular\">Jo Ri</span><span class=\"scholar\">Jo ri</span> is also an important Bon holy site.
