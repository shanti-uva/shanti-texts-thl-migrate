The site sits at the northeast foot of <span class=\"popular\">Cheri Teldzong</span><span class=\"scholar\">Phye ri thal rdzong</span>, a prominent hill of the locale (see E-22). The terrain is level, sandy and overgrown with <span class=\"popular emph\">drama</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">gra ma</span> brush. The ground must have presented quite a different and less degraded appearance at the time the monuments were created. In addition to a row of pillars and associated walls, here are four funerary enclosures at the site. All these structures are built of a dark, grained rock. The very sandy ground upon which <span class=\"popular\">Zhingsa Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Zhing sa rdo ring</span>was built has taken a large toll on the integrity of the monuments. </p> <p>According to <span class=\"popular\">Runtor</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ru &rsquo;thor</span> elders, <span class=\"popular\">Zhingsa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Zhing sa</span> was farmed in ancient times. Two small perennial streams originating from the flanks of the meridian range flow through this sandy basin. No terracing, retaining walls or other signs of old agriculture were detected at <span class=\"popular\">Zhingsa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Zhing sa</span>. Such structures, however, could have been easily engulfed by the unstable sandy terrain. </p> <h4 id=\"b2-1-61-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>In <span class=\"popular\">Runtor</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ru &rsquo;thor</span>, sites such as <span class=\"popular\">Zhingsa Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Zhing sa rdo ring</span> are commonly attributed to the ancient <span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span>.</p> <h4 id=\"b2-1-61-4\">Site elements</h4> <h5 id=\"b2-1-61-4-1\">Enclosure</h5> <p>Only portions of two east-west running walls have endured. These walls are spaced 6.8 m apart. The north wall segment is 6.5 m long and the south wall segment is 7 m long. The variable-length (10 cm to 30 cm long) stones of the double-course walls (around 60 cm thick) are flush with the ground surface or slightly protrude above it. The two extant wall segments fall far short of embracing the entire row of pillars. This may indicate that the enclosure was not of the standard design or that some pillars were erected outside of it. </p> <h5 id=\"b2-1-61-4-2\">Pillars</h5> <p>The nine unhewn pillars form an uneven row 12.6 m long that is roughly oriented north-south. These highly eroded, dark-colored pillars stand just west of the two extant wall fragments. The area around the pillars has been heavily disturbed by <span class=\"popular emph\">drama</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">gra ma</span> brush and a build up of sand. Stones scattered around the pillars are likely to have been part of the proximate walls. From north to south, the pillars have the following dimensions and forms:</p> <ol> <li>Long-stone DR1: irregularly shaped, (80 cm [height] x 1 m [basal girth]).</li> <li>Long-stone DR2: irregularly shaped (70 cm x 1.1 m).</li> <li>Long-stone DR3: four-sided (90 cm x 1.1 m).</li> <li>Long-stone DR4: tabular (90 cm x 1.1 m).</li> <li>Long-stone DR5: irregularly shaped (70 cm x 1.1 m).</li> <li>Long-stone DR6: four-sided (50 cm x 90 cm).</li> <li>Long-stone DR7: irregularly shaped (35 cm x 70 cm).</li> <li>Long-stone DR8: irregularly shaped (35 cm x 70 cm).</li> <li>Long-stone DR9: irregularly shaped (80 cm x 90 cm).</li> </ol> <h5 id=\"b2-1-61-4-3\">Outlying funerary structures</h5> <h6 class=\"essay\">Funerary Structure FS1</h6> <p>Funerary structure FS1 is situated 51 m west of the north end of the row of pillars. Its perimeter walls are composed of smaller stones (up to 30 cm long). No coherent wall fragments have survived in FS1, thus its design characteristics are difficult to ascertain.</p> <p>Funerary structures FS2, FS3 and FS4 were built on the same sandy bench. These three enclosures appear to be of the heaped-stone wall typology (II.2c).</p> <h6 class=\"essay\">Funerary Structure FS2</h6> <p>Funerary structure FS2 (21 m x 11 m) is situated 90 m southwest of FS1. This enclosure has an irregular form. Only swathes of stones (1 m to 1.5 m wide) that do not rise much above ground level form its walls.</p> <h6 class=\"essay\">Funerary Structure FS3</h6> <p>Funerary structure FS3 (12.6 m across) is situated 65 m south of FS2. Its perimeter is partially intact.</p> <h6 class=\"essay\">Funerary Structure FS4</h6> <p>Funerary structure FS4 (13 m across) is situated 42 m south of FS3. Its nebulous perimeter has an ovoid form. </p> <table cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\" class=\"navarrows\"> <tbody> <tr> <td class=\"leftcell\"> <a class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-left.gif\" title=\"Previous Section\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"midcell\"> <a class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-up.gif\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"rightcell\"> <a class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-right.gif\" title=\"Next Section\"/> </a> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div id=\"chap-id\">/bellezza2/b2-1-61/</div> <div style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\" class=\"jqmWindow\" id=\"chapRefWindow\"> <div class=\"closebtn\"> <a href=\"#\">Close</a> </div> <div style=\"height: 280px;\" class=\"conx-content\"> <h3>Note Citation for Page <span class=\"pgnm\"/> </h3> <p class=\"biblref\">John Vincent Bellezza, Antiquities of Zhang Zhung: A Comprehensive Inventory of Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Monuments on he Tibetan Upland (Charlottesville, VA 22904:Tibetan &amp; Himalayan Library, 2010), <span class=\"pgnm\"/>. </p> <h3>Bibliographic Citation</h3> <p>John Vincent Bellezza.
