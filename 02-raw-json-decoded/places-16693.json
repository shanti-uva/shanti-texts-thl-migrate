At this location there are two enclosed pillar complexes separated by approximately 1 km. The red mountain with a fierce reputation, <span class=\"popular\">Jomo Rirang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Jo mo ri rang</span> (see A-54, B-23, B-24), is visible 15 km to the northwest. The sandy and grassy terrain at both complexes is almost level. The large highly weathered pillars are mostly tan in color, but also grayish and reddish. There are no suitable rocks to use as pillars in the vicinity of <span class=\"popular\">Gyatembur Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rgya steng &rsquo;bur rdo ring</span>. </p> <h4 id=\"b2-1-51-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>According to local <span class=\"popular emph\">drok pa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">&rsquo;brog pa</span> of <span class=\"popular\">Zhungsa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gzhung sa</span>, the pillars of <span class=\"popular\">Gyatembur Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rgya steng &rsquo;bur rdo ring</span>magically sprang up in primordial times. Some local sources believe that he stones used for the pillars must have come from the mountain <span class=\"popular\">Rusbel Mukpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rus sbal smug po</span>, located about 10 km to the northeast (see C-124, E-27). This is where the parent rock is supposed to be located. It would have required significant manpower and organization to ransport the large pillars to their present location. </p> <h4 id=\"b2-1-51-4\">Site elements</h4> <h5 id=\"b2-1-51-4-1\">rGya steng &rsquo;bur rdo ring West</h5> <h6 class=\"essay\">Enclosure</h6> <p> <span class=\"popular\">Gyatembur Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rgya steng &rsquo;bur rdo ring</span>West has a far-reaching eastern vista, while the views west are completely cut off by a low-lying ridge (30&deg; 43.065&#900; N. lat. / 81&deg; 01.045&#900; E. long. / 4630 m). The south and east walls of the enclosure are partly intact, but no coherent wall segments remain. The north and west walls of the enclosure are now completely absent. The enclosure appears to have been aligned in the cardinal directions and appears to measure 12 m (east-west) x 14 m (north-south). An enclosure with longer north-south dimensions also occurs at <span class=\"popular\">Chu Puk Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Chu phug rdo ring</span> (C-62). This appears to be a regional variation in the proportions of enclosures limited almost exclusively to far western Tibet. The walls of the enclosure are composed of unhewn stones primarily 10 cm to 25 cm in length, which are flush with the ground surface. </p> <h6 class=\"essay\">Pillars</h6> <p>There are four in situ pillars and two dislodged specimens in<span class=\"popular\">Gyatembur Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rgya steng &rsquo;bur rdo ring</span>West. They were erected near what must have been he west wall of the enclosure. From south to north, they have the following dimensions and characteristics:</p> <ol> <li>Long-stone DR1: four-sided, well formed (1.7 m [height] x 1.4 m [basal girth]).</li> <li>Long-stone DR2: tabular, severely inclined (2.4 m x 1.6 m). The broad sides of this pillar face north and south. There is a counterclockwise swastika (5 cm high) carved on the south face of DR2, 70 cm above ground level. There are also nondescript motifs carved on the south face of DR2. These carvings are of considerable age as evidenced by the degree of repatination they have undergone. </li> <li>Long-stone DR3: four-sided (1.4 m x 1.1 m).</li> <li>Long-stone DR4: four-sided, broken (40 cm x 80 cm). There are also two fallen and partly submerged specimens, 1.3 m and 1.2 m long. </li> <li>The faint remains of what may be a funerary enclosure are situated 80 m west of the pillars on a moderately inclined slope. Given the sandy terrain, it is certainly possible that other superficial funerary structures at the site have either disappeared from view or have completely disintegrated.</li> </ol> <h5 id=\"b2-1-51-4-2\">rGya steng &rsquo;bur rdo ring East </h5> <h6 class=\"essay\">Enclosure</h6> <p> <span class=\"popular\">Gyatembur Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rgya steng &rsquo;bur rdo ring</span>East has long views in both the east and west directions (42. 964&#900; / 01.367&#900; / 4640 m). The enclosure is not well aligned in the cardinal directions and measures approximately 10 m (east-west) x 11 m (north-south). The east wall of the enclosure has been entirely destroyed. The longest surviving coherent wall fragment (2.4 m long, 50 cm thick) is found in the north wall of the enclosure. This double-course wall segment is composed of variable-length (15 cm to 40 cm long) blocky stones, which are mostly flush with the ground surface. There are iny coherent wall fragments in the west and south walls of the enclosure as well. Different types of rocks (white, gray and tan) were used to build the enclosures. </p> <h6 class=\"essay\">Pillars</h6> <p>Five inclined pillars of <span class=\"popular\">Gyatembur Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rgya steng &rsquo;bur rdo ring</span>East are clustered near the southwest side of the enclosure. The broad sides of the pillars are roughly oriented south and north. A sixth pillar was planted near the northwest side of the enclosure. From south to north, the dimensions and characteristics of the pillars are as follows:</p> <ol> <li>Long-stone DR1: tabular (1.9 m x 1.2 m). The Tibetan letters <span class=\"popular emph\">ma</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma</span> and <span class=\"popular emph\">cha</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">cha</span> were carved several times on the broad north side of DR1. The erosion and repatination of these letters indicates that they are of substantial age. </li> <li>Long-stone DR2: tabular (1.7 m x 70 cm).</li> <li>Long-stone DR3: tabular (2.3 m x 1.3 m).</li> <li>Long-stone DR4: irregularly shaped (1.6 m x 1.3 m).</li> <li>Long-stone DR5: irregularly shaped (2 m x 1.1 m).</li> <li>Long-stone DR6: irregularly shaped, an isolated (northwest) specimen (1.6 m x 1.5 m). There is also a dislodged broken specimen a total of 1 m in length. </li> </ol> <h4 id=\"b2-1-51-5\">Affiliated sites</h4> <p>There are also two pillars at a summer encampment (<span class=\"popular emph\">yarsa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">dbyar sa</span>) known as <span class=\"popular\">Mamogya Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ma mo rgya lhas rdo ring</span> (30&deg; 42.052&#900; N. lat. / 81&deg; 02.415&#900; E. long. / 4650 m). These pillars are found on a gravel bench situated between two ent enclosures (<span class=\"popular emph\">nangra</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">nang ra</span>). The local oral tradition affirming that the two standing stones of <span class=\"popular\">Mamogya Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ma mo rgya lhas rdo ring</span> are ancient is corroborated by their highly eroded appearance. The pillars are spaced 2.3 m apart. The tabular east specimen measures 1.7 m (height) x 1.6 m (basal girth). The west specimen is irregularly shaped and measures 1.5 m x 1.1 m. On the east side of the east pillar the six syllable <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma &#7751;i </span>mantra was carved a long time ago. It is reported that many stones used to be found in the vicinity of the pillars, but in the last 25 or 35 years they were removed in order o build pastoral facilities. It must be questioned whether the pillars of<span class=\"popular\">Mamogya Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ma mo rgya lhas rdo ring</span> were originally installed at this location. Their aspect and the local topography seem somewhat out of place with the creation of such monuments. </p> <table cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\" class=\"navarrows\"> <tbody> <tr> <td class=\"leftcell\"> <a class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-left.gif\" title=\"Previous Section\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"midcell\"> <a class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-up.gif\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"rightcell\"> <a class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-right.gif\" title=\"Next Section\"/> </a> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div id=\"chap-id\">/bellezza2/b2-1-51/</div> <div style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\" class=\"jqmWindow\" id=\"chapRefWindow\"> <div class=\"closebtn\"> <a href=\"#\">Close</a> </div> <div style=\"height: 280px;\" class=\"conx-content\"> <h3>Note Citation for Page <span class=\"pgnm\"/> </h3> <p class=\"biblref\">John Vincent Bellezza, Antiquities of Zhang Zhung: A Comprehensive Inventory of Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Monuments on he Tibetan Upland (Charlottesville, VA 22904:Tibetan &amp; Himalayan Library, 2010), <span class=\"pgnm\"/>. </p> <h3>Bibliographic Citation</h3> <p>John Vincent Bellezza.
