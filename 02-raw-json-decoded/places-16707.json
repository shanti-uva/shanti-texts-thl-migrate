The site is situated on he left side of the valley above the marshy bottomland. The views are fairly open in all but the eastern direction, which is constricted by the ridge on the opposite side of the <span class=\"popular\">Tratsang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Khra tshang</span> valley. The terrain is well drained, sandy and gravelly. In addition to two pillars there is still at least one funerary enclosure at the site. </p> <h4 id=\"b2-1-65-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>According to local elders, <span class=\"popular\">Tratsang Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Khra tshang rdo ring</span> magically sprang into existence in primordial times.</p> <h4 id=\"b2-1-65-4\">Site elements</h4> <h5 id=\"b2-1-65-4-1\">Enclosure</h5> <p>The enclosure is now highly fragmentary. There is a 3 m long fragment of the west wall (50 cm thick) still in place, which is situated 60 cm west of the pillars. This double-course wall segment is composed of stones 20 cm o 25 cm in length, which are flush with the ground surface. East of the pillars there are two east-west oriented wall fragments, the most southerly of which may have been part of the enclosure&rsquo;s south wall. A 5-m length of this wall is in situ and it is of the same construction as the west wall. The other east-west wall fragment is located 50 cm north of the south wall fragment. This seems to be an uncharacteristic placement for a wall in this monument typology. This inner east-west wall fragment (2.4 m long, 40 cm wide) is composed of upright stones, 15 cm to 25 cm in length. </p> <h5 id=\"b2-1-65-4-2\">Pillars</h5> <p>The two unhewn pillars of <span class=\"popular\">Tratsang Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Khra tshang rdo ring</span> are spaced 35 cm apart. The intact, four-sided specimen measures 80 cm (height) x 1.1 m (basal girth). The other specimen is broken (30 cm x 90 cm). These pillars are made of a white rock that has urned red in certain places. The area in front of the pillars moderately slopes down to the east, in the direction of the valley bottom. When the pillars were originally installed, this ground is liable to have been much more level. </p> <h5 id=\"b2-1-65-4-3\">Outlying funerary structure</h5> <p>There is a rectangular enclosure (4.5 m x 2.3 m) situated 17 m north of the two pillars on moderately sloping ground. Its partially intact double-course walls (40 cm to 50 cm thick) are composed of cobbles and blocky stones (10 cm to 50 cm long). The larger stones project upwards of 15 cm above the ground surface. A small <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma &#7751;i </span>wall is found 14 m north of this funerary enclosure. One can only wonder if it was created from stones extracted from other funerary enclosures of the site. </p> <table cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\" class=\"navarrows\"> <tbody> <tr> <td class=\"leftcell\"> <a class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-left.gif\" title=\"Previous Section\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"midcell\"> <a class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-up.gif\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"rightcell\"> <a class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-right.gif\" title=\"Next Section\"/> </a> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div id=\"chap-id\">/bellezza2/b2-1-65/</div> <div style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\" class=\"jqmWindow\" id=\"chapRefWindow\"> <div class=\"closebtn\"> <a href=\"#\">Close</a> </div> <div style=\"height: 280px;\" class=\"conx-content\"> <h3>Note Citation for Page <span class=\"pgnm\"/> </h3> <p class=\"biblref\">John Vincent Bellezza, Antiquities of Zhang Zhung: A Comprehensive Inventory of Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Monuments on he Tibetan Upland (Charlottesville, VA 22904:Tibetan &amp; Himalayan Library, 2010), <span class=\"pgnm\"/>. </p> <h3>Bibliographic Citation</h3> <p>John Vincent Bellezza.
