The site occupies the north rim of an amphitheatre in the upper portion of the <span class=\"popular\">A wang</span><span class=\"scholar\">A dbang</span> valley. Below this amphitheatre, the many rivulets of the a dbang chu converge. The nine poorly preserved <span class=\"popular emph\">do khang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rdo khang</span> of the site were built on a series of rocky and turf-covered shelves. The shifting sandy soil appears to have hastened their disintegration. Although the structures are quite widely spaced, they are all in view of one another. A pass called <span class=\"popular\">Nang Chu La</span><span class=\"scholar\">Nang chu la</span> connects <span class=\"popular\">A wang</span><span class=\"scholar\">A dbang</span> with <span class=\"popular\">Dzong Chu</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdzong chu</span> on the <span class=\"popular\">Tis&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ti se</span> circumambulatory trail. The edifices of <span class=\"popular\">A wang</span><span class=\"scholar\">A dbang</span> have a southern or southwestern aspect and are in eyeshot of <span class=\"popular\">Langa Tso</span><span class=\"scholar\">La lnga mtsho</span>. From vantage points just above the site ma pang g.yu mtsho can also be seen. Although all the <span class=\"popular\">do khang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo khang</span> are extremely degraded, it appears that they were constructed in the typical fashion. All structures have been leveled below the roofline. Rather than being oriented in the cardinal directions, these buildings were aligned in conformance with local topographic conditions. There are no signs of mortar in the random-rubble walls (50 cm to 60 cm thick). Gray slabs of variable length (primarily 20 cm to 60 cm long) were used in the construction of these walls. Scattered among the debris of the <span class=\"popular\">do khang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo khang</span> are corbels and roof sheathing (up to 1.5 m long). </p> <p> <span class=\"popular\">A wang</span><span class=\"scholar\">A dbang</span> was an integral community occupying an exclusive geographic zone. It probably catered to the religious and perhaps political elite of the region, who physically removed themselves from the main centers of economic production (pastoral and agricultural) located in lower elevation areas. Unlike some of the archaic residential sites around <span class=\"popular\">Tis&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ti se</span>, there are no signs that the Buddhists reoccupied <span class=\"popular\">A wang</span><span class=\"scholar\">A dbang</span>. Its location outside the confines of he <span class=\"popular\">Tis&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ti se</span> circumambulatory path appears to have made his site of marginal importance to the Buddhists of the area. Given the extent of the ruins, several dozen people may have once resided at any given time at<span class=\"popular\">A wang</span><span class=\"scholar\">A dbang</span>. There would be little use for a single individual to occupy the eight or nine rooms that seem to have comprised most buildings. As such, these <span class=\"popular emph\">do khang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rdo khang</span> may have housed family units or groups of religious practitioners. </p> <h4 id=\"b1-2-29-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>None appears to exist.</p> <h4 id=\"b1-2-29-4\">Site elements</h4> <h5 id=\"b1-2-29-4-1\">Residential complex</h5> <h6 class=\"essay\">Residential Structure RS1</h6> <p>Residential structure RS1 (9.3 m x 4.3 m)<a href=\"#n86\" name=\"nb86\" class=\"note\">86</a> is located on the edge of a grassy prow (30&deg; 58.04&#900; N. lat. / 81&deg; 22.98&#900; E. long. / 5170 m). It is possible that there was also a forward tier of rooms in this building (adding about 4 m to its width) but the structural evidence is inconclusive. Most of RS1 has been reduced to fragmentary foundations but small standing wall segments (up to 60 cm high) also exist. </p> <h6 class=\"essay\">Residential Structure RS2</h6> <p>Residential structure RS2 (13 m x 5.1 m) is located directly above RS1 on a small rocky shelf (58.08&#900; / 23.04&#900; / 5210 m). A forward wall fragment (1.5 m long, 1 m high) has survived but the rest of the structure has been leveled. It appears to have had two rows of rooms oriented laterally with the slope. These rows are at the same elevation and each probably contained four rooms. The rear wall of RS2 is built into the uphill slope to a depth of 50 cm.</p> <h6 class=\"essay\">Residential Structure RS3</h6> <p>Residential structure RS3 (7.2 m x 4.6 m) has been reduced to a dissolute foundation overgrown with turf (58.12&#900; / 22.97&#900; / 5210 m). </p> <h6 class=\"essay\">Residential Structure RS4</h6> <p>Residential structure RS4 (14 m x 8 m) is situated 10 m northwest of RS3. This relatively large structure had wo or three rows of rooms all built at the same elevation. Most walls have been leveled but in spots they reach up to 80 cm in height. Most partition walls have been destroyed so the ground plan of RS4 is ambiguous. The rear wall of RS4 is built about 50 cm into the uphill slope.</p> <h6 class=\"essay\">Residential Structure RS5</h6> <p>Residential structure RS5 (approximately 7.2 m x 7.2 m) is situated 35 m northwest of RS4. RS5 sits on its own turf-covered shelf. Only the tiniest bits of coherent footings have survived.</p> <h6 class=\"essay\">Residential Structure RS6</h6> <p>Residential structure RS6 (11.2 m x 12.2 m) is the largest structure at <span class=\"popular\">A wang</span><span class=\"scholar\">A dbang</span>, and occupies its own grassy shelf (58.16&#900; / 22.90&#900; / 52 10 m). It contained three rows of rooms, probably with three rooms in each. The rear row of rooms is situated about 70 cm higher than the two forward rows. Only small coherent wall segments remain in RS6; these reach a maximum height of 60 cm. An east wall fragment is built 90 cm into the slope. </p> <h6 class=\"essay\">Residential Structure RS7</h6> <p>Residential structure RS7 (10 m x 8.4 m) is located directly below RS6 at the foot of a slope (58.13&#900; / 22.90&#900; / 5190 m). This edifice has been reduced to heaps of stones except for its rear wall, which was built 50 cm to 90 cm into the uphill slope.</p> <h6 class=\"essay\">Residential Structure RS8</h6> <p>Residential structure RS8 (9 m x 8.5 m) is situated 20 m west of RS7 on the same shelf (58.13&#900; / 22.88 &#900; / 5190 m). This structure is so deteriorated that even little of its foundation is coherent. There is a small <span class=\"popular emph\">lhara</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">lhas ra</span> (corral) amid rubble on the edge of a shelf 53 m southwest of RS8. This corral and stones dispersed around it could possibly have been part of another <span class=\"popular emph\">do khang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rdo khang</span> or a shrine complex. </p> <h6 class=\"essay\">Residential Structure RS9</h6> <p>Residential structure RS9 was built on the same shelf as RS7 and RS8 (58.10&#900; / 22.89&#900; / 5190 m). RS9 is so fragmentary that even its overall dimensions are unclear. </p> <hr class=\"footnote-divider\"/> <h2>Notes</h2> <div class=\"footnote\"> <a name=\"n85\"/> <a href=\"#nb85\" class=\"note\"> [85] </a> Possibly the spelling of this toponym should be <span class=\"popular\">A Wang</span><span class=\"scholar\">A wang</span>, reflecting a <span class=\"popular\">Zhang Zhung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Zhang zhung</span> language orthography.
