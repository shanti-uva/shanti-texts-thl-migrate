It is located approximately 1 km from the village of <span class=\"popular\">Shangpa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Shang pa</span>. This relatively small installation occupies the 30-m-tall formation bounding the edge of the valley. The site is divided into east and west summits by a steep gully. Two masonry ramparts erected at different elevations barricade this south-facing gully. The staggered breastworks and small habitational footprints clinging to the formation exhibit morphological characteristics often associated with the <span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span>, the dominant ethnic group in archaic cultural horizon <span class=\"popular\">Gug&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ge</span>, according to the oral tradition. There are around two dozen caves at <span class=\"popular\">Zhay&eacute; Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Zha ye mkhar</span>, mostly situated near the base of the formation. </p> <h4 id=\"b1-1-16-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>According to local residents, <span class=\"popular\">Zhay&eacute; Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Zha ye mkhar</span> was a fortress of the ancient <span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span>.</p> <h4 id=\"b1-1-16-4\">Site elements</h4> <h5 id=\"b1-1-16-4-1\">East summit</h5> <p>On the east summit of <span class=\"popular\">Zhay&eacute; Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Zha ye mkhar</span> there are the remains of a single building (8 m x 5 m) with cobble lower walls on which stand adobe wall sections 1 m o 3 m in height. These walls were constructed on a substantial cobble revetment, 1 m to 1.5 m in height. Such ype of walls could only have supported a building constructed with a wooden roof. </p> <h5 id=\"b1-1-16-4-2\">West summit</h5> <p>The nearby west summit had a similarly constructed building (10 m x 7 m), of which only small sections of adobe walls survive. On the west side of the west summit structure there is a cobble revetment 2 m to 2.5 m in height. Below this revetment there is a 2.2-m wide level area created by a cobble retaining wall, 50 cm to 2 m in height. Below this wall there is another level area (1.5 m in width), surrounded by a cobble wall a maximum of 2.2 m in height. These two masonry terraces probably supported small buildings at one time. On another terrace (3 m x 5 m), located below the west side of the summit edifice, there is a 65-cm high adobe wall segment. At just 20 cm thick, this adobe fragment has undergone a tremendous degree of dissolution. The terrace it sits on is bound by a masonry wall footing totaling 20 m in length. Adjacent to this terrace, on a small pinnacle, there is a finely built foundation that must have supported an edifice no larger than 3.5 m x 3.5 m. The construction of an edifice on this tiny pinnacle is in keeping with design attributes of archaic residential sites. </p> <h5 id=\"b1-1-16-4-3\">Other ruins</h5> <p>Directly above the village of <span class=\"popular\">Shangpa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Shang pa</span> there is another archaeological site locally referred to as a &lsquo;castle&rsquo; (<span class=\"popular emph\">khar</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mkhar</span>). On a small summit (2.5 m x 11 m) there are adobe wall fragments (a maximum of 2.5 m in height), which rest upon cobble foundations. There appear to be other wall-footings in close proximity. Located upstream of the village, above the confluence in the valley, are the ruins of the <span class=\"popular\">gelukpa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dge lugs pa</span> shang dgon pa. </p> <table cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\" class=\"navarrows\"> <tbody> <tr> <td class=\"leftcell\"> <a class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-left.gif\" title=\"Previous Section\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"midcell\"> <a class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-up.gif\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"rightcell\"> <a class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-right.gif\" title=\"Next Section\"/> </a> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div id=\"chap-id\">/bellezza/b1-1-16/</div> <div style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\" class=\"jqmWindow\" id=\"chapRefWindow\"> <div class=\"closebtn\"> <a href=\"#\">Close</a> </div> <div style=\"height: 280px;\" class=\"conx-content\"> <h3>Note Citation for Page <span class=\"pgnm\"/> </h3> <p class=\"biblref\">John Vincent Bellezza, Antiquities of Zhang Zhung: A Comprehensive Inventory of Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Monuments on he Tibetan Upland (Charlottesville, VA 22904:Tibetan &amp; Himalayan Library, 2010), <span class=\"pgnm\"/>. </p> <h3>Bibliographic Citation</h3> <p>John Vincent Bellezza.
