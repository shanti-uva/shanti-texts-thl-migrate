The site has an eastern aspect, overlooking a vast plain that erminates near the sacred mountain, <span class=\"popular\">kyungka</span><span class=\"scholar\">Skyung ka</span>. The terrain is generally grassy and with a slope gradient of around 10&deg;. <span class=\"popular\">Gokri</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sgog ri</span> is situated only about 2 km east of <span class=\"popular\">Mig&ouml;n Ch&ouml;nyi</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mi mgon chos nyid</span> (D-81), and shares the same topographic and morphological traits as this site. As such, these two sites are culturally and chronologically closely related. There are 19 terraced funerary structures at <span class=\"popular\">Gokri</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sgog ri</span>, which form a long row along the base of the hill. These consist mostly of larger rectangular specimens (50 m&sup2; to 100 m&sup2;). The erraced funerary structures of <span class=\"popular\">Gokri</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sgog ri</span> are built in the same fashion as other examples of the typology (II.2e) in the far eastern <span class=\"popular\">Jangtang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Byang thang</span>. The forward/downhill sides of the structures are elevated as much as 2 m above the lower slope, while rear walls are generally flush with the slope. The two long walls of hese flat-topped structures are oriented perpendicular to the axis of the slope. With few exceptions, stones without any discernable pattern or arrangement line the forward flank and the two sides of each structure. However, the deliberate stacking of stones is also encountered. In quite a few larger specimens there are rear wall traces flush with the uphill slope or slightly elevated above it. Most, if not all, of the structures are free from structural elements situated inside the outer walls. Variable-length (20 cm to 60 cm long), grayish volcanic (?) rocks were used in construction. </p> <p>Some of the terraced funerary structures have depressions on top, giving the impression that they were excavated at one time. It is also possible, however, that these concavities were formed through subsidence and/or erosion. Fortunately, the monuments of <span class=\"popular\">Gokri</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sgog ri</span> do not appear to have been disturbed recently. The largest terraced funerary structure of <span class=\"popular\">Gokri</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sgog ri</span> is designated funerary structure FS9 (12 m x 8.5 m). The upper portion of its forward flank consists of four vertical courses of stones forming a wall, 50 cm in height. </p> <h4 id=\"b2-2-42-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>None was collected.</p> <table cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\" class=\"navarrows\"> <tbody> <tr> <td class=\"leftcell\"> <a class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-left.gif\" title=\"Previous Section\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"midcell\"> <a class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-up.gif\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"rightcell\"> <a class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-right.gif\" title=\"Next Section\"/> </a> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div id=\"chap-id\">/bellezza2/b2-2-42/</div> <div style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\" class=\"jqmWindow\" id=\"chapRefWindow\"> <div class=\"closebtn\"> <a href=\"#\">Close</a> </div> <div style=\"height: 280px;\" class=\"conx-content\"> <h3>Note Citation for Page <span class=\"pgnm\"/> </h3> <p class=\"biblref\">John Vincent Bellezza, Antiquities of Zhang Zhung: A Comprehensive Inventory of Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Monuments on he Tibetan Upland (Charlottesville, VA 22904:Tibetan &amp; Himalayan Library, 2010), <span class=\"pgnm\"/>. </p> <h3>Bibliographic Citation</h3> <p>John Vincent Bellezza.
