There \u0026rsquo;Dul ba rgyal mtshan established a family considered sacred (gdung brgyud) with the name of lCags mdud situated to the east of the river and below the village of A gling. The family temple which he built became his main residence and was called sNang zhig lCags mdud dgon (NKhGL p.99). Later the temple was extended into a small monastery. The family was famous for its possession of an old silver image of the Bonpo sage Dran pa nam mkha\u0026rsquo; known as lCags mdud dngul sku, \u0026ldquo;the Silver image of the lCags mdud family\u0026rdquo;. gYung drung rgyal mtshan, the brother of \u0026rsquo;Dul ba rgyal mtshan, died at the age of twenty-four leaving two sons: gYung drung bstan pa\u0026rsquo;i rgyal mtshan and bSam \u0026rsquo;grub.

However, in the recent times there were interruptions in the line of the family and the monastery has made great effforts to reestablish the hereditary succession.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn 1938, with the help of the local people, lCags mdud Nyi ma bstan \u0026rsquo;dzin (1898-1953) moved the monastery to sNa steng and so it became known as sNa steng Monastery. Later lCags mdud sKal bzang rgyal mtshan (1922-1978) took charge of the monastery. The monastery was destroyed during the Cultural Revolution and the present head of the monastery is lCags mdud Zla ba rgyal mtshan (b.1951). He took the initiative to rebuild it in the 1980s. gYung drung nyi ma (b.1973) acts as teacher in the new monastery.\u003c/p\u003e \u003ch4 id=\"b6-16-1-4\"\u003e4.

After thirteen years of study, the latter sent him back to Amdo. When he arrived in Shar khog, gTso tshang dbon po and his fifteen disciples came to meet him and became his disciples. Later he was offered land by the local people and founded a hermitage at the site called Rin spungs. Later he extended it into monastery. Towards the end of his life, a thirteen-year old boy called dGe \u0026rsquo;dun shes rab (b.1811) from dMu dge came to Rin spungs following a vision he had received in dream. gYung drung bstan rgyal was very enthusiastic about the new visitor and exhorted his disciples to accept dGe \u0026rsquo;dun shes rab as his reincarnation after his death. He asked dGe \u0026rsquo;dun shes rab to return to the monastery in seven years. He is said to have even made an inventory of all his personal belongings in the presence of dGe \u0026rsquo;dun shes rab, and ordered the monks to give them to dGe \u0026rsquo;dun shes rab upon his return. However, dGe \u0026rsquo;dun shes rab did not return seven years later as agreed so gYung drung bstan rgyas, before his death, left a testament for him in a small wooden box which he hid in the wall of his meditation cell. Finally, the monastery sent some monks to dMu dge to talk with dGe \u0026rsquo;dun shes rab\u0026rsquo;s family who warmly welcomed them and accepted the recognition of their son as the reincarnation of gYung drung bstan rgyal, but the boy was not at home. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn the mean time, dGe \u0026rsquo;dun shes rab had travelled to rGyal rong, Khyung po, Kong po, lHa sa, rMe\u0026rsquo;u tshang, Dar ldings, Zhu tshang; he studied at rMan ri for seven years, practiced meditation at Byang gNam mtsho for one year and Khyung po\u0026rsquo;i sgom grwa for another six years, and had visited many sacred places and monasteries of different traditions (including Buddhism) where he studied and practiced meditation with various great masters and acquired the new name of Shes rab ye shes. Shortly after his return to dMu dge, remembering his promise to gYung drung bstan rgyal, he returned to the monastery.

History\u003c/h4\u003e \u003cp\u003eAfter the events of Cultural Revolution, there were several unsuccessful attempts to found a new monastery for all the Bonpo population in Shar khog. Finally, in the nineteen-eighties the local authorities gave permission to rebuild one Bonpo monastery on the site of the old dGa\u0026rsquo; mal Monastery. It regrouped the five former main monasteries: dGa\u0026rsquo; mal, sNa steng (No.199), Rin sprungs (No.200), sNang zhig dngul sku (No.201), and sKyang tshang (No.202).\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhen the assembly hall of the new dGa\u0026rsquo; mal was completed, Shes rab mthar phyin (b.1933) was chosen to be the abbot and sKal bzang dar rgyas the chief teacher (bon slob) of the new monastery. The monks of the old dGal\u0026rsquo; mal were content to cooperate in establishing the new dGa\u0026rsquo; mal. Later, however, the monks of sKyang tshang, sNang zhig, Rin sprungs, sNa steng and other monasteries in the area began to rebuild their own monasteries at their original sites and resumed independent religious activities. This event led the monks of the old dGa\u0026rsquo; mal to rebuild their own monastery too, although the two are now located within the same compound. The new dGa\u0026rsquo; mal nevertheless continues to function as a representative body of the five monasteries.\u003c/p\u003e \u003ch4 id=\"b6-16-11-4\"\u003e4.

His successor was gTso \u0026rsquo;phags Nyi ma rgyal mtshan. After several generations the gTso tshang lineage was interrupted, but was reestablished with gYung drung bstan \u0026rsquo;dzin who rebuilt the assembly hall (\u0026rsquo;du khang) in 1862. The monastery was then looked after by a series of religious practitioners: bSod nams bstan rgyal, Shes rab bstan \u0026rsquo;dzin, A khu \u0026rsquo;Brug yag, gYung drung phun tshogs and Kun dga\u0026rsquo; rgyal mtshan. The monastery was closed down during the Cultural Revolution and was reopened in 1995, later than most monasteries which, for the most part, were rebuilt in the 1980s.
