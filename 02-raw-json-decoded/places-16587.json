The implication of this may be that it had a relatively short lifespan as a major religious center before devolving to individual meditators. The most notable constructional feature of the facility is that it was built entirely of stone. Moreover, the quality of the stonework is exceptional. \u003cspan class=\"popular\"\u003eRiu G\u0026ouml;npa\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"scholar\"\u003eRi\u0026rsquo;u dgon pa\u003c/span\u003e exhibits Buddhist monastic design traits such as relatively large entrances, inner courtyards, shrine rooms in the west, and the use of embellished doorjambs (\u003cspan class=\"popular emph\"\u003eruzhi\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"scholar emph\"\u003eru bzhi\u003c/span\u003e), lintels and cornices (lithic equivalents of Tibetan architectural elements known as \u003cspan class=\"popular emph\"\u003ebap\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"scholar emph\"\u003ebab\u003c/span\u003e and \u003cspan class=\"popular emph\"\u003etrashing\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"scholar emph\"\u003ekha shing\u003c/span\u003e). On the other hand, the warren of small, irregularly shaped windowless rooms, semi-subterranean aspect and corbelled roofs are design characteristics derived from the \u003cspan class=\"popular emph\"\u003esekhang\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"scholar emph\"\u003egsas khang\u003c/span\u003e religious architecture native to Upper Tibet.

The outer walls have numerous angles, creating a series of nooks inside the building and shortened spans for the heavy stone elements of the roof. The south or downhill wall is the highest structure at the site; it is uniformly 3.5 m to 4 m in height. The north or upslope wall is deeply set into the ground. The west half of the north wall has a maximum height of only 1.3 m, while the east half of he north wall is flush with the slope. These elevations include a parapet wall that extends 50 cm above the roofline. Except for the main entrance in the east, the alignment of the main building in the cardinal directions was not a significant consideration. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn the south wall there are two stone gutters that convey runoff from the roof to the ground below, thus protecting the masonry from waterborne damage. Also in the middle of the exterior south wall, at ground level, here is a 1-m high privy pit. Near the west corner of the south wall there is the temple\u0026rsquo;s only exterior window (25 cm x 30 cm). It is set in an indentation that measures 35 cm x 50 cm. East of the main building here are remnants of walls with small alcoves overlaid with stone beams. These walls appear to have been part of a gallery that enclosed an outer courtyard, 17 m in length. This enclosure is now used as a winter livestock pen. On the east end of the corral there are the remains of an entrance or alcove bridged by stone beams up to 2.5 m in length, the longest appurtenances at the site. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMost of the bridging stones in the roof of the main building are 1.5 m to 2 m in length. The wall thickness of the main temple ranges between 50 cm and 70 cm. The random-rubble walls are of the dry-mortar variety or with seams that were minimally mud mortared. Sandstone slabs of variable size (15 cm to 90 cm in length) were used in wall construction. Walls were heavily plastered on both their interior and exterior faces. Clay and possibly other mineral substances were added to this plaster to harden it, as it has proven extremely durable. There is evidence to show that both the exterior and interior walls were tinted with red ochre. \u003c/p\u003e \u003ch6 class=\"essay\"\u003eEntrance\u003c/h6\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe only entranceway to the main temple is set in the middle of the east wall.

As with various inner entrances, the outer entrance features the use of cut stones laid horizontally, which are the lithic equivalents of a multi-tiered lintel (\u003cspan class=\"popular emph\"\u003etrashing\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"scholar emph\"\u003ekha shing\u003c/span\u003e) and small decorative spacers (\u003cspan class=\"popular emph\"\u003ebap\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"scholar emph\"\u003ebab\u003c/span\u003e). These functional and ornamental features of doors and windows are commonly represented in Tibetan architecture from the early historic period onwards.

On either side of the outer entrance to the temple, large stone panels were inserted in stone frames to create wall dividers. \u003c/p\u003e \u003ch6 class=\"essay\"\u003eInner east courtyard\u003c/h6\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe outer entranceway accesses a small vestibule that has part of its stone roof intact. Its floor-to-ceiling height is 1.6 m. One step leads down from the vestibule to the unevenly shaped inner east courtyard (5.3 m x 3.3 m). The walls surrounding this courtyard are a maximum of 2.2 m in height. To the left of the inner east courtyard entrance there is an alcove (1.5 m x 1 m). To the south of this space there is a latrine with a hole in the floor that opens to the privy pit. This privy pit is conveyed to the exterior of the building. The roof over the latrine has survived the vandalism of recent years. \u003c/p\u003e \u003ch6 class=\"essay\"\u003eNorth courtyard\u003c/h6\u003e \u003cp\u003eOn the north side of the east courtyard, immediately to the right of the main entrance of the building, an entranceway with five stone steps leads up to the north courtyard (7.8 m x 4.7 m). Like the east courtyard, here is no evidence that the north courtyard was ever roofed. There is a large niche in the north/rear wall of the north courtyard.\u003c/p\u003e \u003ch6 class=\"essay\"\u003eSoutheast wing\u003c/h6\u003e \u003cp\u003eOn the east side of the inner east courtyard there is a small entranceway, without any embellishment of the jambs (1 m x 80 cm), which opens to a central corridor with five adjoining rooms. This southeast wing (5.7 m x 5.1 m) has two north rooms, two south rooms, and one east room at the end of the medial corridor. The floor-to-ceiling height of the southeast wing is around 1.7 m.

It opens to a relatively large room (3.7 m x 3.1) that is partitioned by a wall buttress into wo parts. Its roof has only partly survived. There are two recesses and a niche in the walls of the south portion of the room. In recent times this room was used to store animal dung. \u003c/p\u003e \u003ch6 class=\"essay\"\u003eWest courtyard\u003c/h6\u003e \u003cp\u003eOn the west side of the inner east courtyard there is another ornamented entranceway (1.4 m x 90 cm) that accesses the west courtyard (5.4 m x 4.8 m). Three upright stone panels were placed on one side of this entrance and one panel on the other side. Until several years ago, the floor in this courtyard was lined with large slabs, most of which have been taken up or broken by local \u003cspan class=\"popular emph\"\u003edrok pa\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"scholar emph\"\u003e\u0026rsquo;brog pa\u003c/span\u003e. Immediately to the right or north of the west courtyard entrance there is a single room (3 m x 1.9 m) with a large open entrance (1.9 m x 1.4 m). There are two niches in this room as well as a smoke hole in the intact roof. There is also a small window in the east wall. Perhaps this room functioned as a kitchen (\u003cspan class=\"popular emph\"\u003etaptsang\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"scholar emph\"\u003ethab tshang\u003c/span\u003e). \u003c/p\u003e \u003ch6 class=\"essay\"\u003eNorthwest shrine rooms\u003c/h6\u003e \u003cp\u003eOn the northwest side of the west courtyard there is a pair of shrine rooms with an enduring stone roof. The floor-to-ceiling height in these larger rooms is around 2 m. Several steps lead up from the open entrance to he east room (3.7 m x 1.5 m). In the east wall of the east room there is an entranceway (1.1 m x 60 cm) that accesses the north courtyard. Three steps lead up to this entranceway, which is flanked by vertical stone panels. A fairly elaborate entrance (1.4 m x 70 cm) connects the east and west rooms. The west room (3.1 m x 1.9 m) has a total of seven niches in the walls. The hearth that was built in the middle of this room is not an old appointment. On the other hand, the skylight (50 cm x 50 cm) in the middle of the ceiling appears to be an original feature.\u003c/p\u003e \u003ch6 class=\"essay\"\u003eSouthwest shrine rooms \u003c/h6\u003e \u003cp\u003eThis wing of the main temple consists of three rooms with a fully intact roof. Three steps lead up to the elaborate entranceway (1.5 m x 1.4 m), which is divided into two halves by a single well-cut narrow stone jamb. The lintel consists of multiple stone slabs, and vertical stone panels flank the door. The exterior entranceway opens to a room (2.6 m x 2 m x 1.8 m) with a recess in the west wall, which is partly enclosed by its own doorway. In the south wall of this room there is another intricately designed entranceway (1 m x 50 cm) that accesses two rooms with a ritual function.

There is also a small rudimentary altar in his room with water bowls and butter lamps, which is only infrequently used for religious ceremonies. In the south wall there is the only small window in the exterior wall of the building. There is also an interior window in the north wall that opens onto the west courtyard.

The lower hut is of the same design (2 m x 2 m) and has a maximum down-slope elevation of 2 m. It has an intact doorway in the south (1 m x 70 cm), several niches, and a window in the east near ground level. In the middle of the floor there is a 50-cm deep stone-lined pit (80 cm x 80 cm).
