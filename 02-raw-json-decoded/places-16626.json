This is also indicated by the oral tradition and the placement of the building in a wide-open plain. Archaic residential sites were much more commonly located in hard-to-reach, defensible locales, while such open ground was usually reserved for burial. \u003cspan class=\"popular\"\u003eBumo Lhakhang\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"scholar\"\u003eBu mo lha khang\u003c/span\u003e, therefore, may have functioned as a temple-tomb or mausoleum.

They died when the roof collapsed on them and they were buried inside. There is said to be a hollow underneath the floor of the edifice in which the woman are entombed.

There are also some pieces of white granite in these lower wall courses. The stonework of the exterior walls extends 1.3 m to 1.6 m above ground level on all but the east side of the structure (90 cm high on this side), providing a substantial base. The adhesive used for the stonework is a white clay-based mortar. The superstructure consists of light-colored earthen blocks with a bluish cast laid in regular courses. These blocks (45 cm x 25 cm x 8 cm) have high gravel content and are especially hard and resistant to crumbling. The factors explaining this hardness are not immediately apparent. This type of building material has not been detected at any other site in Upper Tibet.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe current floor of the interior of the structure declines to the east (it is elevated 1.3 m to 3 m above the surrounding terrain). A lip on the floor above the east revetment indicates that, in this direction, the interior was elevated approximately 1.3 m above surrounding terrain. As the interior slopes up towards the west side of the structure, this could possibly indicate that the interior space was split between two or more elevations. This is also suggested by the other sides of the revetment, which are significantly higher than the east base of the building. The seams between each vertical course of earthen blocks (filled with a hard white mortar) are 3 cm to 4 cm thick. The regular courses thus achieved is of a high order of workmanship. There are also traces of a white clay-based plaster on the interior walls (around 3 m in height). In the upper section of he west wall there are two openings that are likely to have become enlarged through damage. There are also various openings in the south and north walls within 1 m of the current top of the structure. Much of the east wall of the superstructure is missing (there is now a 3.9-m wide gap in it), destroying what must have been the entrance to the edifice. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAt the foot of the exterior west wall there are the remains of a slab wall embedded in the surface of the ground. It is quite well centered between the two sides of the edifice. This superficial structure extends 2.2 m from the building in a perpendicular fashion. Parallel slabs of stone (around 25 cm in length) were laid in the ground edgewise to create a wall around 30 cm thick. Such double-course slab walls are a common feature at many archaic funerary sites of Upper Tibet.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn the Spring of 2004, local \u003cspan class=\"popular emph\"\u003edrok pa\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"scholar emph\"\u003e\u0026rsquo;brog pa\u003c/span\u003e removed many stones from the revetment of \u003cspan class=\"popular\"\u003eBumo Lhakhang\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"scholar\"\u003eBu mo lha khang\u003c/span\u003e and brought hem to their camps. These stones were taken so that mantras could be carved on them. This pilferage has caused much damage to the structure.

The walls of this fragmentary superficial structure contain parallel courses of stones (granite and sandstone) and are 50 cm thick. In some places additional stones were interspersed between the parallel lines of masonry. This structure is flush with the surrounding terrain or slightly elevated above it. There is an analogous double-course enclosure (5.2 m x 6.5 m) situated 69 m east of he edifice.

Each of these superficial structures is comprised of hree to more than 30 stones that are embedded in the ground. It could not be determined if they were at one ime taller or of regular dimensions.

Near the edifice the clumps of stones are spaced about 8 m from one another. Farther to the northwest this spacing is not as regular (possibly because of the disappearance of the structures).

It consists of white granite double-course perimeter walls (60 cm hick) that are mostly flush with the ground surface. There are also upright stones in the perimeter walls that protrude upwards of 25 cm from the surface. Near the southwest corner of the structure there is an inner enclosure hat measures 1.7 m (east-west) x 3.3 m (north-south).
