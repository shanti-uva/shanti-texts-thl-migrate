Name</h3> <p>bKra shis sMan ri</p> <h3 id=\"b4-1-2\">2. Location</h3> <p>sMan ri Monastery is located in Thob rgyal <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">xiang</span> in rNam gling rdzong, Shigatse. From the sTag gru kha ferry, it is a full day&rsquo;s ride on horseback. On the way there are two farming villages, mDzob bzang and Glang phu. Two high mountain passes called Gong nyag la and dByar rnga la must be crossed before reaching the monastery. Another route, passable by car, starting at Shigatse, goes through rNam gling rdzong up to Thob rgyal <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">xiang</span>. From there to the monastery, halfway up the mountain, is a half-day ride on horseback.</p> <h3 id=\"b4-1-3\">3. History</h3> <p>The monastery was founded in 1405 by mNyam med Shes rab rgyal mtshan (1356-1415), formerly a monk in gYas ru dBen sa kha. His successor, rGyal tshab Rin chen rgyal mtshan, enlarged it with several monks&rsquo; living quarters. After having been gradually expanded over four centuries, the monastery became an important centre for the propagation of Bonpo doctrines. Apart from having two assembly halls, it had many buildings and there were about three hundred monks divided among four monastic colleges: Gling stod, Gling smad, Gling skad and Gling zur and six hostels (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">khang tshan</span>): A sta, Rong mi, La dbyil, rGyal rong, Grub thob and Drel pa. The monk students came from various regions of Tibet. Among the Bonpo, the monastery was considered the source of all their monastic and liturgical traditions.</p> <p>From the founder of the monastery, mNyam med Shes rab rgyal mtshan, to the abbot Shes rab blo gros, there were thirty-two abbots. The last abbot, Shes rab blo gros, fled to India in 1959 and later died there. The monastery itself was completely destroyed during the Cultural Revolution and remained unrestored for about twenty years. Rebuilding of the monastery did not begin until 1984, and it is still under reconstruction.</p> <p>In 1970, the new sMan ri Monastery was founded at Dolanji, Himachal Pradesh, India. With this establishment, the monastic tradition of sMan ri has been revived through the efforts of its abbot, Lung rtogs bstan pa&rsquo;i nyi ma (b.1929), who is now counted as the thirty-third abbot of sMan ri.</p> <p>The monastery had a system of abbotship. Abbots were appointed by a lottery from among those well versed in religious philosophy and holding the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">dge bshes</span> degree. The line of abbots is as follows:</p> <ol type=\"1\"> <li>Shes rab rgyal mtshan (1356-1415)</li> <li>Rin chen rgyal mtshan</li> <li>Nam mkha&rsquo; ye shes</li> <li>Kun bzang rgyal mtshan</li> <li>bsTan &rsquo;dzin rin chen rgyal mtshan</li> <li>Tshul khrims rgyal mtshan</li> <li>bSod nams ye shes</li> <li>bSod nams g-yung druung</li> <li>She tsu drung mu</li> <li>Shes rab &rsquo;od zer</li> <li>gYung drung rgyal mtshan</li> <li>Shes rab blo gros</li> <li>Shes rab &rsquo;od zer (2nd)</li> <li>gTsug phud &rsquo;od zer</li> <li>gYung drung tshul khrims</li> <li>Rin chen &rsquo;od zer</li> <li>Rin chen lhun grub</li> <li>Shes rab bstan &rsquo;dzin</li> <li>Shes rab dbang rgyal</li> <li>gYung drung dbang rgyal</li> <li>Phun tshogs rnam rgyal</li> <li>bSod nams blo gros</li> <li>Nyi ma bstan &rsquo;dzin</li> <li>bSod nams phun tshogs</li> <li>Shes rab g-yung drung</li> <li>Sangs rgyas bstan &rsquo;dzin</li> <li>bsTan &rsquo;dzin Tshul khrims</li> <li>Phun tshogs blo gros</li> <li>rGyal ba blo gros</li> <li>bsTan pa blo gros</li> <li>Nyi ma dbang rgyal</li> <li>Shes rab blo gros</li> <li>Lung rtogs bstan pa&rsquo;i nyi ma</li> </ol> <h3 id=\"b4-1-4\">4.
