Whether measured by the traditional understanding of when they were re-revealed upon Tibetan soil, or the modern scholarly understanding of their historical development through a series of Tibetan authors, the three series represent overlapping phases of development in early Great Perfection practice, thought, and literature. The Mind Series (\u003cspan class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\"\u003esems sde\u003c/span\u003e) represents the earliest stage from the eighth to eleventh centuries, the Space Series (\u003cspan class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\"\u003eklong sde\u003c/span\u003e) the next stage in the tenth to eleventh centuries, and the Esoteric Precept Series (\u003cspan class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\"\u003eman ngag sde\u003c/span\u003e) the final stage in the eleventh to fourteenth centuries. The general trajectory in these three historical stages was towards greater incorporation of formal descriptions of ritual and contemplative practice, tantric imagery of violence and sexuality, subtle body physiology, and practices of light meditation. That said, all of the traditions continued past their early formative phase as vital traditions of practice, composition, and transmission right into the present, though the Esoteric Precept Series without a doubt was the dominant tradition from at least the fourteenth century onwards.\u003c/p\u003e","source_url":null,"is_primary":true,"created_at":"2013-09-15 04:19:18 UTC","updated_at":"2013-09-15 04:19:18 UTC","authors":[{"id":"2","fullname":"David Germano"}]}]}
