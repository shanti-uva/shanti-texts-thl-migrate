During the Tibetan imperial period, a man by the name of Amchok S&ouml;nam Norbu (a mchog bsod nams nor bu) took his followers from &Uuml;tsang (dbus gtsang) to Dom&eacute; (mdo smad) and settled down in a place, which was later named after him: Amchok. His great-grandfather was a minister under King Tri Songdetsen (khri srong lde btsan) and his family was called Amchok because he received a seal with the Tibetan letter &ldquo;A&rdquo; on it from the king. And their family was connected to the Kh&ouml;n (&rsquo;khon) family of Sakya (sa skya). In Amchok, S&ouml;nam Norbu built a four-story residence for himself and called it the Red Palace.</p> <p>People in Amchok practiced B&ouml;n until the eighteenth century when a local monk converted them to Geluk (dge lugs). The monk&rsquo;s name was S&ouml;nam Ch&ouml;mpel (bsod nams chos &rsquo;phel) and he completed the <em>Lharampa</em> (<em>lha rams pa</em>) degree at Ganden (dga&rsquo; ldan) Monastery. After returning home, he promoted Buddhism and acted as the temporal and religious leader of Amchok. He was considered the first Amchok Rinpoch&eacute; (a mchog rin po che).&nbsp;</p> <p>Amchok was independent and they had their own ruler. In other words, Amchok was not ruled by the leaders of other communities. Amchok had seven <em>tsowa</em> (<em>tsho ba</em>) and each had two leaders. Amchok Rinpoch&eacute; was the general leader (<em>spyi dpon</em>). However, the administrative affairs were managed by Amchok P&ouml;npo (a mchog dpon po) along with the fourteen <em>tsop</em><em>&ouml;n</em> (<em>tsho dpon</em>). Amchok had a strong <em>ch</em><em>&ouml;y&ouml;n</em> (<em>mchod yon</em>) relationship with the Three Divisions of Tsawa (tsha ba khag gsum), namely Chokts&eacute; (cog tse), Somang (so mang), and Trochu (khro chu), all kingdoms in Gyelrong (rgyal rong).</p> <p><strong>Reference </strong></p> <p>Hor gtsang &rsquo;jigs med. <em>Mdo smad lo rgyus chen mo las sde tsho&rsquo;i skor glegs bam dang bo </em>[The First Volume of Communities and <em>Tsowa</em> (sde tsho) in the Greater History of Amdo].
