The site is situated on sandy and turf-blanketed slopes with fairly gentle gradients. There are many granite outcrops dotting these slopes. The terraced funerary structures of <span class=\"popular\">Rachen</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ra chen</span> have rectangular, ovoid and trapezoidal forms. They tend to be grouped in meandering rows, each of which is set at the same elevation. Most of these funerary structures are small and simply built with little evidence of coherent wall segments. The rim and forward flank of each structure are lined with stones with no apparent order or arrangement, save for a vertical stacking of stones in a few instances. In those structures with wo longer walls, these are usually oriented perpendicular to the axis of the slope. The forward flanks of the erraced funerary structures are flush with the downhill slope or elevated above it to a height of 20 cm to 1 m (larger specimens). The rear walls, where they exist, are usually flush with the uphill slope. These structures are free from structural elements located inside the outer walls. The terraced funerary structures are mostly constructed of variable-length (10 cm to 60 cm long) uncut pieces of white granite. <span class=\"popular\">Rachen</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ra chen</span> is the most westerly example of the eastern <span class=\"popular\">Jangtang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Byang thang</span> variant of terraced funerary structures documented to date. The site does not appear to have been disturbed in recent times. <span class=\"popular\">Rachen</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ra chen</span> is divided into three sectors: southeast (28 funerary structures), northeast (21 funerary structures) and northwest (23 funerary structures). </p> <h4 id=\"b2-2-40-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>According to local sources, <span class=\"popular\">Rachen</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ra chen</span> represents he remains of an ancient fortress. </p> <h4 id=\"b2-2-40-4\">Site elements</h4> <h5 id=\"b2-2-40-4-1\">Southeast sector </h5> <p>The terraced funerary structures of the southeast sector have the following dimensions, locations and salient characteristics:</p> <ol> <li>Funerary structure FS1 (7.1 m x 3.3 m) has a forward flank, 30 cm in height (31&deg; 27.436&#900; / 89&deg; 55.432&#900;).
