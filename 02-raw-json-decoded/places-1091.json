The county comprises four Qu divided into seventeen xiang and sixty-six villages. Marthang (Mar thang) town (latitude: 31&deg;12&rsquo;N, longitude: 98&deg;49&rsquo;E, altitude: 3,030 m), the capital of the county is located 622 km west of Dartsemdo (Dar rtse mdo), the capital of the Kardze Prefecture.</p> <p>There are four Bonpo, twenty seven rNying ma pa, one bKa&rsquo; brgyud pa and three Sa skya pa monasteries in dPal yul county.</p> <h3 id=\"b6-6-1\">(145) Kha rag Monastery</h3> <h4 id=\"b6-6-1-1\">1. Name</h4> <p>The monastery&rsquo;s full name is dPal gShen bstan kha rag g-yung drung bde chen gling.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-6-1-2\">2. Location</h4> <p>&rsquo;Dzin chu river<a href=\"#n7\" name=\"nb7\" class=\"note\">7</a> is the longest in dPal yul county. It is a tributary of the &rsquo;Bri chu (Yangtze) river, and its total length is 180.8 km. It flows along a south to north axis, from the common border of &rsquo;Ba&rsquo; thang, Li thang and dPal yul, through six districts (xiang), &rsquo;Dam thar, A thsab, mNyam skyid, &rsquo;Dzin khog, Rag khyab and Hor spo till it joins the &rsquo;Bri chu river. The river is named after &rsquo;Dzin khog, a valley through which it flows. Kha rag Monastery is located on the north bank of the river, about 90 km northeast of Marthang, the county seat. </p> <h4 id=\"b6-6-1-3\">3. History</h4> <p>Kha rag is a very ancient place-name in the history of Bon. Bonpo people believed that it was one of the forty-five gathering places (&rsquo;du gnas) founded by Mu khri bTsan po, the second king of the Yar lung kings in Tibet, and gShen Nam mkha&rsquo; snang ba mdog can when they invited hundreds of Bonpo masters from Zhang zhung. Dran pa&rsquo;i rnam thar g-yung drung gsang mdzod and bKa&rsquo; brgyad brgyud<a href=\"#n8\" name=\"nb8\" class=\"note\">8</a> also mentioned Kha rag as one of the &rsquo;du gnas of Bon founded in the period of King Mu khri btsan po. </p> <p>The history of Kha rag can be divided into two parts: its history as a &rsquo;du gnas and later as a dgon pa. As a &rsquo;du gnas, it has a long history, and has been regarded as a sacred site from the outset. There are several legendary versions dealing with Kha rag, but they all seem too fantastical to relate here.</p> <p>There was a written history of the &rsquo;du gnas entitled Kha rag gnas kyi lo rgyus by Gling gshen Mu la blo gros, which might have contained valuble information, and I spent much time looking for it when I visited Khams in the autumn of 1997, but unfortunately I was unable to find it. </p> <p>In accordance with the oral tradition recorded by Bya Tshe ring in a history of Kha rag, the founder of Kha rag monsatery was Ngo zhu Tshul khrims rgyal mtshan. His family was originally from Bru sha (Gilgit) and was known as Bru sha rNam sras spyi ring. During King Khri srong lde btsan&rsquo;s persecution of Bon in the 8th century, Bla klu dbang, a Bonpo master belonging to the Bru sha family fled to the &rsquo;Dzin valley in Khams and founded a monastery at Nor bu&rsquo;i dbu rtse in Khrom stod khams lung east of dDe dge. After five generations, Tshul khrims rgyal mtshan was born in the Fire-Dog year (986A.D.). His father was Ye shes rgyal mtshan and his mother, Zhu bza&rsquo; gYung drung mtsho. Since his mother was from Zhu, an ancient and famous family in the history Bon, he was called Ngo zhu Tshul khrims rgyal mtshan. From that time, the family of Bru in Kha rag was known as Ngo zhu Bru tshang. In accordance with the wishes of his father Ye shes rgyal mtshan, Ngo zhu Tshul khrims rgyal mtshan founded a monastery at the holy site of Kha rag, and his family took the name of Kha rag tshang. The lineage ran for forty-eight generations. The first twenty-eight descendants were: </p> <ol type=\"1\"> <li>Ngo zhu Tshul khrims rgyal mtshan </li> <li>Nam mkha&rsquo; bstan &rsquo;dzin</li> <li>bKra shis g-yung drung </li> <li>Phun tshogs dbang rgyal</li> <li>Shes rab rgyal mtshan </li> <li>Kun bzang g-yung drung </li> <li>Phun tshogs rgyal mtshan </li> <li>&rsquo;Chi med g-yung drung </li> <li>&rsquo;Chi med blo gsal </li> <li>Rin chen rgyal mtshan </li> <li>bsTan &rsquo;dzin gtsug phud </li> <li>Kun dga&rsquo; ye shes </li> <li>gYung drung blo gros </li> <li>Shes rab g-yung drung </li> <li>bKra shis rin chen </li> <li>bsKal bzang nor bu </li> <li>gYung drung bstan rgyal</li> <li>Nam mkha&rsquo; blo gros </li> <li>&rsquo;Chi med tshe dbang </li> <li>gYung drung blo gsal </li> <li>Kun bzang bstan &rsquo;dzin </li> <li>gYung drung bstan &rsquo;dzin </li> <li>bSod nams bkra shis </li> <li>A rten </li> <li>A tshan </li> <li>gSang sngags </li> <li>&rsquo;Jam dpal blo gros </li> <li>Kun dga&rsquo; blo gros </li> </ol> <p>In addition to the twenty-eight masters mentioned above, there was a very learned master called gYung drung bstan pa&rsquo;i rgyal mtshan who belonged to the eighteenth generation of the Kha rag tshang family. He was born in the Fire-Rat year of the 9th Rab byung (1516). His father&rsquo;s name was sKal bzang nor bu, and his mother&rsquo;s Ye shes lha &rsquo;dzoms. gYung drung bstan pa&rsquo;i rgyal mtshan founded a monastery called rJes ri at the foot of Mount Bon ri in Kong po where he introduced the practice of the observance of the summer fast (dbyar gnas) and the dgu gtor rite. He also founded a meditation centre (sgrub grwa) in Kha rag lla rgyal rtse mo where he initiated the ritual tradition of mNyam med Shes rab rgayl mtshan. He wrote more than ten volumes of works, but unfortunately very few of them survived. Nam mkha&rsquo; blo gros, the 18th master in the line, was born in the Wood-Dragon year of the 9th Rab byung (1556). He received teachings from gYung drung bstan pa&rsquo;i rgyal mtshan and built a three-storey assembly hall (&rsquo;du khang). From his time onwards, the hereditary succession of the Kha rag tshang has continued unbroken to this day. </p> <p>Kha rag &rsquo;Jam dbyangs blo gsal rgyal mtshan (b.1939), the last descendant, took me to monasteries Zla &rsquo;od and gTsug &rsquo;od near Kha rag Monastery when I was visiting the area in autumn 1997. The system of succession through reincarnation was never adopted in this monastery and the hereditary line of Kha rag tshang is still the head of the monastery.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-6-1-4\">4. Hierarchical system</h4> <ul xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" class=\"bullet-blue\"> <li>dgon bdag, a hereditary line, the present one is Kha rag bla ma.</li> <li>dbu mdzad</li> <li>dgos skos</li> <li>phyag mdzod</li> <li>spyi gnyer</li> </ul> <p>All the incumbents are elected by monks and changed every seven years with the exception of the dgon bdag.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-6-1-5\">5.

The young novices are taught by masters of their choice.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-6-1-7\">7. Educational exchange</h4> <p>The monastery was formerly closely connected with gYas ru dben sa kha<a href=\"#n9\" name=\"nb9\" class=\"note\">9</a>. This connection is mentioned in the history of the A khrid system of meditation. Later the monastery developed close ties with sMan ri, gShen Dar sdings and rMe&rsquo;u tshang in Central Tibet, and rJes ri Monastery in Kong po. At present the monks go to Shar rdza Hermitage for further training but there are no regular educational exchanges between Kha rag and other monasteries.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-6-1-8\">8 / 9.

Manuscripts and printed books</h4> <p>The monastery has two printed copies of Kanjur and various other texts.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-6-1-10\">11. Economic circumstances of the monastery</h4> <p>The monastery depends on donations from its followers.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-6-1-11\">12. Local community</h4> <p>The local lay community consists of one community: rGur (or rGu ru) spun gsum, &ldquo;the three brothers of rGur&rdquo;, divided into three branches with a total of thirty-four families (around two hundred people). According to oral tradition, these people are the decsendants of the rGur spun gsum tribe mentioned in the Ge sar epic.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-6-1-12\">14. Local festivals</h4> <p>There is a la btsas at the top of the mountain behind the monastery called Kha rag sdong brag which is believed to be the residence of the local deity of the same name. It was reconstructed in 1988 in accordance with the instructions given by Kun gsal blo gros, the present chief teacher at gYung drung gling Monastery in gTsang. The deity&rsquo;s propitiation takes place on the 15th day of the 4th month.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-6-1-13\">Sources</h4> <h5 id=\"b6-6-1-13-1\">(1) Interviews</h5> <p>In autumn of 1997: Kha rag &rsquo;Jam dpal blo gsal rgyal mtshan (b.1939), the present Kha rag bla ma </p> <h5 id=\"b6-6-1-13-2\">(2) Texts</h5> <ol type=\"1\"> <li>&rsquo;Dzing kha rag dgon gyi lo rgyus by Bya Tshe ring, MS</li> </ol> <h3 id=\"b6-6-2\">(146) Zla &rsquo;od Monastery</h3> <h4 id=\"b6-6-2-1\">1. Name of the monastery</h4> <p>In the ancient inscription on the wall inside the assembly hall (&rsquo;du khang), which I will discuss below, the name of the monastery appears as rDa dbus dgon pa.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-6-2-2\">2. Location</h4> <p>The monastery is located about two hours on horseback southeast of Kha rag Monastery, at the top of a hill and surrounded by a forest. It is about 70 km northeast of the county town of dPal yul. </p> <h4 id=\"b6-6-2-3\">3. History</h4> <p>According to oral tradition, Pad ma bdud &rsquo;dud, the youngest son of Khod po sNang ldan, married Chos mtsho and had three sons. The eldest, Nam mkha&rsquo;i rgyal po, founded Zla &rsquo;od Monastery (No.146), and became known as Zla &rsquo;od Nam mkha&rsquo;i rgyal po, the second son, Nyi ma&rsquo;i rgyal po, founded gTsug &rsquo;od Monastery (No.147) near by, and was subsequently known as gTsug &rsquo;od Nyi ma&rsquo;i rgyal po. The youngest son founded a monastery at sTag mgo gdong, on a hill resembling the head of a tiger, in a valley called gYang zla gzhi in the same locality as the other two monasteries. The year of the monastery&rsquo;s foundation is believed to be 1124A.D., but there is no evidence to substantiate this. </p> <p>Zla &rsquo;od Nam mkha&rsquo;i rgyal po was the prelate of the kings of Khro skyabs and Brag steng, two of the eighteen kingkdoms of rGyal rong. The history of the monastery after his time, as well as the chronology of its successive masters remain unclear: </p> <ol type=\"1\"> <li>Zla &rsquo;od Nam mkha&rsquo;i rgyal po </li> <li>gYung drung rgyal mtshan </li> <li>bSod nams rgyal mtshan </li> <li>gTshug phud </li> <li>Shes rab bkra shis </li> <li>Nyi ma rgyal mtshan </li> <li>Nam mkha&rsquo; rgyal mtshan </li> <li>sByin pa &rsquo;od zer </li> <li>Nam mkha&rsquo; lhun grub </li> <li>bSlab gsum phun tshogs </li> <li>bSam gtan </li> <li>rGyal ba g-yung drung </li> <li>A don</li> <li>bsTan &rsquo;dzin rnam rgyal </li> <li>Pad ma rgyal mtshan </li> <li>&rsquo;Chi med </li> </ol> <p>Since dPal yul district belonged to sDe dge in the past, many of the masters mentioned above were close to the kings of sDe dge, and several among them served as their prelates.</p> <p>Unfortunately none of their dates seem credible enough to mention here although I attempted to determine the dates of some of them. </p> <p>I was excited to find a long script on the ancient wall in the assembly hall (&rsquo;du khang) which I hoped would yield some important historical information about the monastery. A monk at the monastery spent much time and energy making a copy of it for me, but unfortunately its content is disappointing. However, it says that the assembly hall was built by a bSod nams rgyal po, and not Nam mkha&rsquo;i rgyal po as mentioned above, although no dates are provided. Otherwise the entire inscription is devoted to the praise of the assembly hall and to the description of the statues within. </p> <p>During the time of gTsug &rsquo;od, Zla &rsquo;od and gTsug &rsquo;od monasteries performed all of their annual rituals together. Despite the damage suffered during the Cultural Revolution, around 11,534 meters of the original wall-patings within the assembly hall have been preserved.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-6-2-4\">4. Hierarchical system</h4> <p>Same as Kha rag Monastery (No.145)</p> <h4 id=\"b6-6-2-5\">5. Current number of monks</h4> <p>There are nine novices and monks at the monastery. </p> <h4 id=\"b6-6-2-6\">6. Current education</h4> <p>There are no organizd classes. The young novices are taught by masters of their choice.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-6-2-7\">7. Educational exchange</h4> <p>The monastery follows the Bru, Zhu or gShen traditions of ritual practice, (mainly the Bru tradition). At present the monastery also follows the New Bon tradition<a href=\"#n10\" name=\"nb10\" class=\"note\">10</a> and the monks go to Shar rdza hermitage for teachings and retreats.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-6-2-8\">8 / 9.

Income and expenses</h4> <p>The monastery depends on donations from the local lay community.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-6-2-11\">12. Local community</h4> <p>The local lay community consists of three villages: Ri tshal phu pa with twenty-five families, Phyug po phu ba with fifteen families and gYang stod phu pa with eighteen families (273 people altogether).</p> <h4 id=\"b6-6-2-12\">13. Local festivals</h4> <p>The mountain behind the monastery is called gSer phu and is believed to be the abode of the local deity Bya chen. There is a la btsas dedicated to him on the summit of the mountain. The deity is propitiated on the 10th day of the 1st month by the monks. </p> <p>Another mountain called gZung mgon 1 km east of the monastery is regarded as the abode of the eponymous local deity. There is a la btsas on its summit. The date of its renewal ceremony is not fixed. The ceremony is attended by the lay members of the Bonpo community</p> <p>There is a sacred mountain (gnas ri) called mDa&rsquo; lHa ri 20 km south of the monastery with a la btsas halfway up. It was first &ldquo;opened&rdquo; (gnas sgo phyed pa) as a holy place by bSod nams dbang rgyal alias Zla &rsquo;od Nam mkha&rsquo; thog &rsquo;dzin and later further sanctified by gTer chen Tshe dbang grags pa and also by Glang zhig. Its veneration ceremony takes place on the 15th day of the 4th month and the ceremony is attended by the members of both Bonpo and Buddhist communities. It is circumambulated following the Bon tradition, (g-yas skor, i. e. counter-clockwise). </p> <h4 id=\"b6-6-2-13\">14.

History</h4> <p>According to oral history, Pad ma bdud &rsquo;dul, a descendant of the Khyung tribe and the youngest son of Khod po sNang ldan, married Chos mtsho, and had three sons. The eldest, Nam mkha&rsquo;i rgyal po, founded Zla &rsquo;od monastery (No.146) and became known as Zla &rsquo;od Nam mkha&rsquo;i rgyal po, the second son, Nyi ma&rsquo;i rgyal po, founded gTsug &rsquo;od temple in the Wood-Dragon year of the 2nd Rab byung (1124) near Zla &rsquo;od Monastery, and became known as gTsug &rsquo;od Nyi ma&rsquo;i rgyal po. </p> <p>Nyi ma&rsquo;i rgyal po married sKal bzang lha mo and had three sons. bsTan pa lhun grub, the eldest son and bDe skyid lha mo had two sons. bsTan pa &rsquo;od zer, the elder one and rTa mgrin mtsho, had a son called lHun grub dbang ldan, who became a renowned master. He and gYung drung dbang mo had four sons. The youngest son married rNa ba tshang Shes rab sgrol ma and had five sons, the middle son became a gter ston. He discovered many gter ma texts and was initiated into the practice of rtsa rlung by Nyag gter gSang sngags gling pa. The youngest son, Pad ma g-yung drung, had three sons, the youngest of whom, gYung drung rgyal mtshan, married Nyi li Bo legs and had two sons. One of the two sons bsTan pa married gZha&rsquo; tsha Rig &rsquo;dzin lha mo and had two sons. The eldest son dBang phyug married Khra tshang Gu ru sgrol ma and had only one son called Phun tshogs who, with Zla &rsquo;od sgrol ma, had three sons; the second son, Rig &rsquo;dzin, was a disciple of Shar rdza bKra shis rgyal mtshan (1858-1934). He married sTag mgo A rnang sgrol ma and had a son called &rsquo;Chi med rgyal mtshan who was recognized by &rsquo;Jam dbyang mkhyen brtse and Thar bde Dri med as the reincarnation of Rab brtan shes rab of lCang lung Monastery (No.148) in the same county. </p> <p>In the lifetime of &rsquo;Chi med rgyal mtshan, the monastery was looted by Nyi grags tshang, a Buddhist family in the same area and the Bon religion was banned until the middle of 20th century. In the 1980s, the monastery was rebuilt at a place called Rab mgo. </p> <p>I obtained an eighteen-page manuscript devoted to the history of the monastery simply entitled gTsug &rsquo;od dgon. It is anonymous. Its author claims that he saw a chronology of the monastery entitled bsTan rtsis nor phreng rab gsal me long, beginning in the Earth-Serpent year of the 5th Rab byung (1269) and ending in 1489. Then new additions were made to bring it up to 1991. The date of the monastery&rsquo;s foundation mentioned above was taken from the anonymous work gTsug &rsquo;od dgon. However, unfortunately, I was unable to find the chronology and I don&rsquo;t even know whether it is still available.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-6-3-4\">4.

His youngest son, gYung drung dbang ldan, founded the original lCang lung Monastery at a place in gTer lhung valley where he discovered a chest containing a bse ru&rsquo;i ra, &ldquo;rhinoceros horn&rdquo;, and that, as a result, became known as bSe ru&rsquo;i mgo. </p> <p>Following is a list of the monastery&rsquo;s masters: </p> <ol type=\"1\"> <li>gYung drung dbang ldan </li> <li>gYung drung lhun grub</li> <li>gYung drung bstan rgyal </li> <li>Nam mkha&rsquo; lhun grub, </li> <li>Blo gros g-yung drung </li> <li>bsTan pa dbang rgyal </li> <li>Kun bzang rgyal mtshan </li> <li>mKhas grub rgyal mtshan </li> <li>Rin chen dbang ldan </li> <li>gYung drung dbang rgyal </li> <li>Nam mkha&rsquo; bzang po </li> <li>bSod nams dbang rgyal </li> <li>bSod nams bzang po </li> <li>lHun grub tshul khrims </li> <li>mChog dga&rsquo; </li> <li>Yon tan rin chen </li> <li>Rin chen </li> <li>bSod nams g-yung drung </li> <li>Kun bzang rgyal mtshan </li> <li>gYung drung rnam rgyal </li> <li>rNam &rsquo;joms </li> <li>gYung drung lha mo </li> <li>Ya ma rgyal </li> <li>bsTan &rsquo;dzin </li> <li>mKhas btsun Bon dbyings rdo rje </li> <li>Tshe dbang g-yung drung </li> <li>Rab brtan shes rab </li> <li>bsTan &rsquo;dzin dbang rgyal </li> <li>Rang lta rin chen </li> <li>Kun bzang rdo rje </li> </ol> <p>This list is taken from a history of the monastery entitled lCang lung dgon, MS, unfortunately no dates are given. The oral accounts of many of these masters that I heard from the local population are also difficult to date. The succession of the masters before gYung drung rnam rgyal, the 20th in the lineage, was hereditary. The masters from the 21st to the 24th is unknown. From the time of mKhas btsun Bon dbyings rdo rje, the 25th master in the lineage, succession by reincarnation was adopted. </p> <p>mKhas btsun Bon dbyings rdo rje defeated a master called dBra sras in a debate and thus won the estime of the royal family of sDe dge who bestowed lands on him, and appointed him as a prelate at the court. </p> <p>The monastery was destroyed during the Cultural Revolution and was rebuilt by the following monks of the monastery:</p> <p>mKhan Sangs rgyas tshe brtan, &rsquo;Chi med rgyal mtshan, the reincarnation of Rab brtan shes rab, Bla ma &rsquo;od zer, bKra shis mgon, Rig &rsquo;dzin rdo rje, and Rang rig.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-6-4-4\">4. Hierarchical system</h4> <ul xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" class=\"bullet-blue\"> <li>dgon bdag</li> <li>one dbu mdzad</li> <li>one dge skos</li> <li>three spyi ba (gnyer ba)</li> <li>two mchod dpon </li> </ul> <p>All the incumbents are replaced every three years.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-6-4-5\">5. Current number of monks</h4> <p>There are thirty novices and monks altogether.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-6-4-6\">6. Current education </h4> <p>There are no organized classes. The young novices are trained by the elder monks.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-6-4-7\">7. Educational exchange</h4> <p>Traditionally, the monastery had very close ties with sMan ri in gTsang, but is now closer to Shar rdza Hermitage in sDe dge.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-6-4-8\">8 / 9. Rituals</h4> <p>Kun rig (ten days), dbyar mchod (twenty-one days), Phur pa (ten days), Me tog mchod pa (seven days), sgrib sbyang (five days), smyung gnas (eighteen days), dbyar gnas (fifty-three days), dgu gtor (seven days), Ma rgyud (five days). </p> <h4 id=\"b6-6-4-9\">10. Books held in the monastery</h4> <p>The monastery has copies of both the Bonpo and Buddhist Kanjur and Tenjur as well as the collected works of the following masters: Shar rdza bKra shis rgyal mtshan, Kun grol &rsquo;Ja&rsquo; tshon snying po, Klong chen rab &rsquo;byams, and &rsquo;Jigs med gling pa.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-6-4-10\">11. Income and expenses</h4> <p>The monastery depends on offerings. The monks provide their own food.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-6-4-11\">12. Local community</h4> <p>The local lay community of the monastery consists of three villages: gYu mgo with twenty families, Chu phyar with twenty families, and Til mgo with thirty families. In other villages there is sDong thog with thirty-four families and sBas gong with seventeen families who were converted to the rNying ma pa tradition. In these villages, the Bonpo practitioners perform the ritual called gsol kha for the families, but for funerary rites the people call upon the monks of the rNying ma pa monastery.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-6-4-12\">13. Local festivals </h4> <p>Mount Ka ye rgyal mo, situated behind the monastery is believed to be a holy mountain blessed by the goddess Byams ma. It was &ldquo;opened&rdquo; (gnas sgo phyed pa) by &rsquo;Jam dbyangs mkhyen brtse dbang po and Kong sprul Yon tan rgya mtsho. Its circumambulation (in the Bonpo way) by the local people takes place on the 15th day of the 4th month.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-6-4-13\">14.

Because of the negative connotation of \"Bon nag\", Shar rdza bKra shis rgyal mtshan does not agree with either appelations; he considers that the distinction between new and old teachings is also incorrect and refers to them as new and old gTer ma (&ldquo;treasures&rdquo;) instead.
