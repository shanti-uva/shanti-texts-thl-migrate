Lying at the center of the \"Old City\" of Lhasa, it is the circumambulation path around the Jokhang, the main cathedral of all of Tibet, with origins in the Tibet's Imperial Period (from the 7th to the 9th Century CE). For the past several hundred years, the Barkor has been a vibrant market, pilgimage site and residential center. The circular Barkor path ranges about 1 km in length, completely encircling the Jokhang and passes by numerous shops, stalls, sidewalk vendors and temples.
