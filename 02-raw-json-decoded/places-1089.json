The seat of Nyag rong county is Ri nang, located at Ri nang pasture in Nyag rong valley. There are ninety-two villages divided between twenty-four townships. The total area of the county is 8,672 sq km. The population is 38,371 (31,388 of whom were Tibetans in 1986). The highest mountain in the county is Kha ba lung ri in Zur pa at an altitude of 5,995 m (its peaks remain snow-capped throughout the year). Nyag chu river flows southward through a deep gorge across the county for 175 km. 10.1% of the county area is covered by forest.\u003ca href=\"#n11\" name=\"nb11\" class=\"note\"\u003e11\u003c/a\u003e There are eight Bonpo monasteries in the county.\u003ca href=\"#n12\" name=\"nb12\" class=\"note\"\u003e12\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/p\u003e \u003ch3 id=\"b6-8-1\"\u003e(150) Ye shes Monastery \u003c/h3\u003e \u003ch4 id=\"b6-8-1-1\"\u003e1.

Gong shod valley is one of the \u0026ldquo;eighteen large valleys\u0026rdquo; (Shod chen bco brgyad) of Nyag rong county. The site of the monastery is called Brag dmar mdo rtsa (literally \u0026ldquo;foot of the red rock\u0026rdquo;), because it is located at the foot of a red rock (Brag dmar). \u003c/p\u003e \u003ch4 id=\"b6-8-1-3\"\u003e3. History\u003c/h4\u003e \u003cp\u003eAccording to oral tradition, during the persecution of Bon under the reign of King Khri srong lde btsan, many Bonpo masters fled from central Tibet, and thus a master called sTag gsas came to Me nyag, and became known as Me nyag sTag gsas. The Bonpo scholar and historian Shar rdza bKra shis rgyal mtshan (1858-1934) also mentions this personage in his historical work.\u003ca href=\"#n13\" name=\"nb13\" class=\"note\"\u003e13\u003c/a\u003e It is also said that Me nyag sTag gsas and rMa lHa rgod of Nyag rong are in fact one and the same. There is a prayer text entitled Lo rgyus gsol \u0026rsquo;debs (MS) in Ye shes Monastery mentioning that \u0026ldquo;the great and powerful hero Me nyag sTag gsas came to Me nyag under the name of rMa gsas lHa rgod\u0026rdquo;.\u003ca href=\"#n14\" name=\"nb14\" class=\"note\"\u003e14\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe son of rMa lHa rgod was called Nam mkha\u0026rsquo; ye shes. He received teachings from his father and then travelled extensively to propagate the Bon religion. He won the esteem and support of Klu rgyal, the chief of Nyag rong who helped him build a monastery at Brag dmar mdo rtsa in his honour. The monastery was named Ye shes Monastery after him. Since the monastery consisted of temples (lha khang), the place became known as Lha khang thang, the \u0026ldquo;plain of temples\u0026rdquo;.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThree generations of Nyag rong chiefs acted as patrons of Nam mkha\u0026rsquo; ye shes: Klu rgyal, his son Klu mgon and his grandson Klu skyabs.\u003ca href=\"#n15\" name=\"nb15\" class=\"note\"\u003e15\u003c/a\u003e Nam mkha\u0026rsquo; ye shes was succeeded by Cang mkhar spo sByin pa rgyal mtshan\u003ca href=\"#n16\" name=\"nb16\" class=\"note\"\u003e16\u003c/a\u003e who spent the first half of his life in Ye shes Monastery, and then left the monastery to live in a hermitage which he founded on a hill called Dar ri, which is why he is also locally known as Dar ri sByin pa rgyal mtshan.

His brother, Mo the\u003ca href=\"#n18\" name=\"nb18\" class=\"note\"\u003e18\u003c/a\u003e Tshul khrims rgyal mtshan, was a lay tantric practictioner and founded sKya thu li temple at La rked stod and gShel lo temple at La rked smad in Nyag rong; because he was very active in La sked, he was also known as Nyag sked tshang, and it is said that his lineage continued to be active in the area for seventeen generations. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eDuring the time of mGon po rnam rgyal, a chief of Nyag rong, gSang mchog, a descendent of Khod spungs sGrub gshen snang ldan, Zla ba grags pa, a descendent of Mo the lineage, gYung drung rgyal mtshan, a son of \u0026rsquo;Od zer gling pa, and Nyag stod sTong ldan mgon po, agreed to rebuild Ye shes Monastery in which three small monasteries were merged as one monastery.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eLater Nyag stod sTong ldan mgon po acted as a patron of the monastery and renamed it Ye shes bshad sgrub gling. According to Rig \u0026rsquo;dzin nyi ma this took place in 1848.\u003ca href=\"#n19\" name=\"nb19\" class=\"note\"\u003e19\u003c/a\u003e In 1908, Shar rdza bKra shis rgyal mtshan visited the monastery. In 1909, Khyung po Nyi ma rgyal mtshan and Tshul khrims mchog rgyal added an assembly hall (\u0026rsquo;du khang) with twelve columns. Both were disciples of Shar rdza bKra shis rgyal mtshan. Nyi ma rgyal mtshan had two sons, gYung drung bdud \u0026rsquo;dul and Ri kho alias Thugs rje gling pa. The former succeeded him after his death.

In his youth, he was recognized as the reincarnation of a master called Dri med \u0026rsquo;od zer, and the abbot of the monastery,Tshul khrims mchog rgyal, kept him in the monastery. In fact the abbot was a brother of his grandfather. He studied under the abbot, gTer ston Tshe dbang \u0026rsquo;gyur med, dBra ston bsKal bzang bstan pa\u0026rsquo;i rgyal mtshan (1897-1959)\u003ca href=\"#n20\" name=\"nb20\" class=\"note\"\u003e20\u003c/a\u003e (10) and rGyal tshab Blo gros rgyal mtsho. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eLater A yung became vice-president of the Political Consultative Conference of dKar mdzes Prefecture, and it was in this capacity he was able to help to rebuild Ye shes Monastery and other local Bonpo monasteries. He worked hard to promote education in Bonpo monasteries in dKar mdzes Prefecture. When I visited dKar mdzes Prefecture in 1997, I saw his photograph in almost every monastery. I then realized how popular he was among the Bonpo community. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn the 1980s, a manuscript copy the Bonpo Kanjur was brought out at dBal khyung Monastery. It was hidden away during the turbulent history. As it turned out, it was the only complete extant copy of the Bonpo Canon. Its publication, owing to the strenuous efforts of A yung and his friend Shug sdong sKal bzang phun tshogs, represents a major contribution to Tibetan cultural heritage, although the published version is not an exact replica of the dBal khyung manuscript. Alongside A yung, another important figure of the monastery was the master gYung drung bdud \u0026rsquo;dul (?-1995). \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn 1983, the authorities granted the monastery permission to reopen. Thanks to A yung and gYung drung bdud \u0026rsquo;dul, and the financial support and labour provided by the local lay community, the monastery was rebuilt and is now one of the most important centres in the region. A rgyal or sKal bzang rgya mtsho, a brother of A yung and \u0026rsquo;Khrin las kun khyab, the son of gYung drung bdud \u0026rsquo;dul, are the present leaders of the monastery.\u003c/p\u003e \u003ch4 id=\"b6-8-1-4\"\u003e4.

Then it was moved to another site but the reason and precise time of this change remain unknown. According to one short account of the monastery\u0026rsquo;s history (rGyal zhing dgon gyi lo rgyus, 8 folios, MS and anonymous), it was founded by the master Bya btang Nam mkha\u0026rsquo; rgyal mtshan in the 10th Rab byung (1567-1626), and later, because there was no Sources of drinking water in the vicinity, Khyung \u0026rsquo;khor sMon lam tshul khrims, the master at that time, moved the monastery to a new place. The new monastery had nine columns and was named rGyal ba bkra shis. The same account mentions three other masters of this lineage, bSod nams rnam rgyal, Kun bzang rnam rgyal and \u0026rsquo;Chi med, but their dates and life stories are not mentioned. In the 19th century, Bya btang Dri med \u0026rsquo;od zer offered the monastery a piece of land known as Zhing stong thang on which the present monastery was built. While the monastery was being built, the people heard a dragon in the sky and thus the monastery was named rGyal zhing \u0026rsquo;brug grags. It was consecrated by Shar rdza bKra shis rgyal mtshan in the early 20th century. It was partially destroyed during the Cultural Revolution and rebuilt in the nineteen-eighties.

No one knows when it was built or why it was abandoned. In the 13th Rab byung (1747-1806), another small monastery was built by gSang sngags gling pa. He also \u0026ldquo;opened the door\u0026rdquo;(gnas sgo phyed pa) of the hidden local mountain (i.e. transformed the place into sacred site) and called it sBas yul g-yung drung spungs tshal. He is believed to have discovered a number of holy objects on the sacred site including a statue of White Tara and a gold gshang bell. He donated these objects to Gong rgyal Monastery. Around that time the monastery had about one hundred monks. In the Wood-Bird Year of the 15th Rab byung (1885), Bya btang bsTan pa\u0026rsquo;i nyi ma undertook to build a new temple for the monastery following a plan made by gSang sngags gling pa. When it was completed two years later, gSang sngags gling pa was invited to consecrate it and to give the lung initiation of the Bonpo Kanjur. Later, other masters such as Shar rdza bKra shis rgyal mtshan, Khro sprul gYung drung mthong grol and the fifth Kun grol bDud \u0026rsquo;dul gling pa also gave teachings at the monastery. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe Gong rgyal dgon gyi lo rgyus (anonymous, MS) lists twenty-two successive masters of the Bya btang lineage until the middle of the 20th century: \u003c/p\u003e \u003col type=\"1\"\u003e \u003cli\u003eNam mkha\u0026rsquo; rgyal mtshan \u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003eNam mkha\u0026rsquo; dbang ldan \u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003eYe shes rgyal mtshan \u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003egYung drung gsas pa \u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003ebKra shis rgyal mtshan \u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003esDa dbon Nam mkha\u0026rsquo; thog sdug \u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003esDa dbon Nam mkha\u0026rsquo; rgyal mtshan \u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003eGrags pa ye shes \u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003eTshe dbang bkra shis \u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003eShes rab bstan \u0026rsquo;dzin \u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003ebSod nams blo gros \u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003ebSod nams \u0026rsquo;od zer \u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003esDa dbon Rin chen blo ldan \u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003eZha bo zhabs ma Nyi ma grags pa \u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003esDa dbon sMon lam tshul khrims \u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003ebsTan \u0026rsquo;dzin dbang grags \u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003egYung drung rgyal mtshan \u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003eTshul khrims rgyal mtshan \u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003egYung drung bstan pa\u0026rsquo;i nyi ma \u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003eDri med \u0026rsquo;od zer \u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003eTshe dbang \u0026rsquo;gyur med \u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003egShen bstan rgyal mtshan \u003c/li\u003e \u003c/ol\u003e \u003cp\u003eWith Bya btang bsTan \u0026rsquo;dzin dbang grags\u0026rsquo;s two sons, the lineage divided into two branches. There are two versions of the history about when reincarnation was adopted for the succession of the Bya btang masters. According to one, the position continued to be hereditary (gdung brgyud) until Tshe dbang \u0026rsquo;gyur med\u0026rsquo;s time in the middle of the 20th century, after which it was transmitted by reincarnation. However, when I visited the monastery in 1997, I was told that the reincarnation system was adopted after Bya btang gYung drung rgyal mtshan\u0026rsquo;s time. So far, because of the lack of reliable Sources it has been impossible to verify either versions of the story.

History\u003c/h4\u003e \u003cp\u003eAccording to oral tradition, Su tshang Nam mkha\u0026rsquo; rgyal mtshan, (the Klu \u0026rsquo;bum dgon gyi lo rgyus, a MS has Nam mkha\u0026rsquo; rgya mtsho), the first master of the Su la lineage, founded a small monastery at Ka smad mgo called Su tshang about 10 km east of the present monastery. He is said to have been the spiritual master of \u0026rsquo;Bru dGa\u0026rsquo; bde chos skyong ber nag, one of the Thirty Heroes in the Ge sar epic. In Khams, the hero is considered as a historical figure. Nam mkha\u0026rsquo; rgyal mtshan was succeeded by his son Nam mkha\u0026rsquo; \u0026rsquo;od zer, who in turn was succeeded by his son Nam mkha\u0026rsquo; bstan \u0026rsquo;dzin, who in turn was succeeded by his son Nam mkha\u0026rsquo; tshul khrims. Since there was no water Sources in the vicinity, Nam mkha\u0026rsquo; tshul khrims undertook to channel water to the monastery, but the inhabitants of sGre bo village were unwilling to help. As a result the village split into two villages: sGre bo stod and sGre bo smad. Moreover, eight monks from sGre bo stod left the monastery and founded a small monastery called Su tshang stod pa. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eLater lCags mdud Shes rab rgyal mtshan, a master of the rNying ma pa monastery and located on the opposite bank of the rDza chu river, converted Su tshang stod pa to the rNying ma pa tradition and renamed it rNga rnga Monastery. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAccording to KGLG, (volume 1, p.302) lCags mdud Shes rab rgyal mtshan only restored the monastery in 1491.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSu tshang Nam mkha\u0026rsquo; tshul khrims and the people of sGre bo smad pa village founded Klu \u0026rsquo;bum Monastery. As they were preparing the site for construction, they discovered a Bonpo text entitled Klu \u0026rsquo;bum, and thus the monastery was named Klu \u0026rsquo;bum. Later Khod spungs Kun bzang \u0026rsquo;od gsal, the twenty-third master in the Su la lineage, enlarged the assembly hall. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe monastery mainly practised rituals according to the old gter ma (gter rnying) tradition, especially the ritual cycles of dBal gsas, Ge khod and sTag la, but after receiving the teachings based on the Rang gter sku gsum phur sgrub by gSang sngags gling pa the monastery also began to practise the new gter ma tradition (gter gsar). \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eKhod spung mDo rgyud grags pa also lived and taught at the monastery for about five years. In 1923, gYung drung bstan \u0026rsquo;dzin, the 24th master in the Khod spung lineage, enlarged the monastery by building a new assembly hall with eight tall columns. The masters of the Khod spungs lineage, also known as Su la tshang, have been in charge of the monastery. It is not clear how many masters the lineage comprises but there are several names that frequently recur in both written and oral traditions. Su la sKal bzang bstan pa\u0026rsquo;i rgyal mtshan (1897-1959), who belonged to this lineage, wrote an extensive biography of Shar rdza bKra shis rgyal mtshan. The present master of Su la is bsKal bzang grags pa. Unfortunately I did not meet him when I visited the monastery in autumn 1997, because he was ill and was hospitalized in Chengdu at the time.

He also renamed the monastery Brag dben gYung drung gling. Then \u0026rsquo;Od zer gling pa built four stupas around the monastery at the four points of the compass.

One among them, rMe\u0026rsquo;u bSod nams g-yung drung, established a hermitage in Tre hor\u003ca href=\"#n29\" name=\"nb29\" class=\"note\"\u003e29\u003c/a\u003e, Khams. Because the hermitage attracted ten thousand disciples, he extended the hermitage into a monastery which then became known as Khri tsho, meaning \u0026ldquo;Ten Thousand\u0026rdquo;. After its destruction by fire, rTsa ra sTobs ldan \u0026rsquo;od zer rgyal mtshan founded another monastery called Shug sgang (\u0026ldquo;Hill of Cypress Trees\u0026rdquo;, after the cypress forest on the mountain on which it was located).
