Dolpa) District</h2> <h3 id=\"b7-2-1\" class=\"space-before\">(220) gYung drung shug tshal gling Monastery</h3> <h4 id=\"b7-2-1-1\">1. Name</h4> <p>The village dgon pa is called gYung drung shug tshal gling. </p> <p>Twenty minutes&rsquo; walk to the east is a hermitage called Brag dgon. The latter is said originally to have been called Brag gung dgon pa. It is officially registered under the Nepalicised name Takun. </p> <h4 id=\"b7-2-1-2\">2. Location</h4> <p>The village of Bar sle (Nep. Bajibara) is situated high above Tarakot on the northern side of the Bheri river and on the western side of the Tarap river. gYung drung shug tshal gling, the main village temple, is some twenty minutes&rsquo; walk above the village. Brag dgon hermitage is a further half-hour walk to the east in a steep exposed corner above the valley. </p> <h4 id=\"b7-2-1-3\">3. History</h4> <h5 id=\"b7-2-1-3-1\">3.1. gYung drung shug tshal gling</h5> <p>There used previously to be two other temples: one further up and one to the west, but these are now both in ruins. </p> <p>The main temple, above the village and next to the house of Bla chung lhag pa is called gSer thang. It is said to be around 500 years old, but no documentary evidence could be produced. It was renovated by a householder priest, the father of gTsug phud rgyal mtshan, and repainted recently by a local thangka-painter called Zla ba. </p> <p>Bla chung lhag pa is the main bla ma of the dgon pa. The late gTsug phud rgyal mtshan was his paternal uncle. He is a married bla ma, and his eldest son will be his successor. There are eleven family members in the household, and their livestock includes yaks, cows and horses. Due to the early death of his father, Bla chung lhag pa&rsquo;s education was not completed. </p> <h5 id=\"b7-2-1-3-2\">3.2. Brag dgon hermitage</h5> <p>This hermitage was built by gTsug phud rgyal mtshan. He helped his father with the rebuilding of gYung drung shug tshal gling, but did not want to follow in his footsteps as a householder priest. He went to bSam gling (No.223) and remained there for three years. After that he stayed for two years in the area of Ri bo dpal &rsquo;bar mountain, meditating in a hermitage. After returning to the village he wanted to build a dgon pa and began to search for a place. He found a steep, rocky place, where there was a stone with a painting of sTon pa gShen rab, and some rocks that resembled a stupa. He believed that this was a sacred place, connected with Me lha or Phyag gi dbang po, whose handprint is to be seen on one of the first rocks encountered on the circuit around Mt. Ri bo dPal dbar. </p> <p>Encouraged by all these auspicious signs, he started to build the first part of Brag dgon temple while living in a cave on the mountain. About this time he was joined by a nun, who was then 21 years old. The first chapel was completed in 1962, and other sections were added subsequently. </p> <h4 id=\"b7-2-1-4\">4. Hierarchical system of gYung drung shug tshal gling and Brag dgon</h4> <p>At first there were two ordained monks, but this lineage ended and has been followed by householder priests (sngags pa). gTsug phud rgyal mtshan was an exception, since he had taken monastic vows. Bla chung lhag pa, his brother&rsquo;s son, is a householder priest who maintains gYung drung shug tshal gling. </p> <p>The lineage of gTsug phud rgyal mtshan and Bla chung lhag pa is called dMu tsha. </p> <h4 id=\"b7-2-1-5\">5. Number of monks/ priests</h4> <h5 id=\"b7-2-1-5-1\">5.1. gYung drung shug tshal gling</h5> <p>Bla chung lhag pa is the main householder bla ma. An old man is taking care of the prayer-wheel house. His son is currently undergoing training in sMan ri Monastery (No.231) in Dolanji. There are no children receiving religious education here at the moment. </p> <p>In Bar sle there are altogether eleven householder priests. </p> <h5 id=\"b7-2-1-5-2\">5.2. Brag dgon hermitage</h5> <p>Only gTsug phud rgyal mtshan and the nun were in residence when the present fieldwork was carried out in 1998. There were no children being educated. </p> <h4 id=\"b7-2-1-6\">6.

Brag dgon hermitage</h5> <p>gTsug phud rgyal mtshan himself travelled a great deal in his youth. He lived in bSam gling for three years and later received initiations from Slob dpon bsTan &rsquo;dzin rnam dag in Kathmandu and from Sangs rgyas bstan &rsquo;dzin in Dolanji. He moved to Klu brag in the latter years of his life to take up residence in the restored dGon phug dgon pa.</p> <h4 id=\"b7-2-1-8\">8.
