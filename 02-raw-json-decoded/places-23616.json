Name</h4> <p>The monastery&rsquo;s full name is gTso tshang sMin grol bstan rgyas gling and was named after its founder, gTso &rsquo;phags Zla ba rgyal mtshan.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-16-12-2\">2. Location</h4> <p>The monastery is located 17 km north of Songpan, the seat of Zung chu county.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-16-12-3\">3. History</h4> <p>According to Hor btsun bsTan &rsquo;dzin blo gros, gTso &rsquo;phags Zla ba rgyal mtshan, was born in the Earth-Rat Year of the 2nd rab byung (1168). His successor was gTso &rsquo;phags Nyi ma rgyal mtshan. After several generations the gTso tshang lineage was interrupted, but was reestablished with gYung drung bstan &rsquo;dzin who rebuilt the assembly hall (&rsquo;du khang) in 1862. The monastery was then looked after by a series of religious practitioners: bSod nams bstan rgyal, Shes rab bstan &rsquo;dzin, A khu &rsquo;Brug yag, gYung drung phun tshogs and Kun dga&rsquo; rgyal mtshan. The monastery was closed down during the Cultural Revolution and was reopened in 1995, later than most monasteries which, for the most part, were rebuilt in the 1980s. Prior to its reopening, its monks lived in Rin spungs Monastery (No.200), since, according to oral tradition, Rin spungs was originally a branch of gTso tshang. </p> <p>The reconstruction of gTso tshang was part of the Development Project of the One Hundred Townships of Sichuan Province launched in 1991 which included gTso tshang township. The monks of gTso tshang Monastery living in Rin spungs moved to the new gTso tshang Monastery after 1995, but, since it is new and small, Rin spungs Monastery still supports it and sends teachers whenever needed and the monastery has in fact become a branch of Rin spungs. The two monasteries perform their annual rituals together.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-16-12-4\">4. Hierarchical system</h4> <ul xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" class=\"bullet-blue\"> <li>dgon bdag, first hereditary</li> </ul> <p>Rin spungs and gTso tshang have two common dge skos: the senior dge skos from Rin spungs and the junior one from gTso tshang. They are both replaced every two years. There are two dbu mdzad both from Rin spungs since the two monasteries perform all their rituals together. The monasteries have two common spyi ba (or gnyer pa) and two mchod dpon who are replaced every two years.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-16-12-5\">6 and 7. Current education and educational exchange</h4> <p>For the reasons mentioned above the monastery maintains close ties with Rin spungs and the monks go there to study. </p> <h4 id=\"b6-16-12-6\">8 / 9. Rituals</h4> <p>The monks go to Rin spungs Monastery (No.200) for major rituals.</p> <p>The monks of Rin spungs also come to gTso tshang Monastery for certain rituals such as the recitation ceremony of the Ma tri from the 23rd day of the 4th month to the 1st day of the 5th month with a &rsquo;cham dance on the last day.
