Due to access problems and he destruction of most remains, it is difficult to assess the importance and architectural composition of these strongholds. Local residents deny that these castles have any association with the <span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span>, but no oral tradition save that they were ancient castles seems to have been preserved. The agrarian character of the settlement, the lack of Buddhist constructions, the fortress attribution of the site, the general geographic pattern of early citadels in the region, and the presence of cobble wall structures may suggest that at least parts of <span class=\"popular\">Khar Tak</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mkhar ltag</span> and <span class=\"popular\">Lukhar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Klu mkhar</span> date to the archaic cultural horizon. A cluster of no less than 14 <span class=\"popular emph\">Ch&ouml;rten</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mchod rten</span> called <span class=\"popular\">Dumdum Ch&ouml;rten</span><span class=\"scholar\">Zlum zlum mchod rten</span> is found on a shelf on the opposite side of the valley. The siting of this Buddhist monument well away from the castles also raises questions about their cultural orientation. </p> <h4 id=\"b1-1-65-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>According to local villagers, <span class=\"popular\">Khar Tak</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mkhar ltag</span> and <span class=\"popular\">Lukhar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Klu mkhar</span> were twin ancient castles. </p> <h4 id=\"b1-1-65-4\">Site elements</h4> <h5 id=\"b1-1-65-4-1\">Summit complex of mkhar ltag</h5> <p>Although a good trail comes within tens of meters, the summit complex of <span class=\"popular\">Khar Tak</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mkhar ltag</span> has not been reachable in living memory. The summit is approximately 45 m in length and very narrow, as confirmed by a 6.5-m long cave about 15 m below it, which opens on both sides of the formation. There are around one dozen caves on the east face of the formation, 10 m to 15 m below the summit. Some small bits of cobble fronts are still in place but most forward sections of the caves have collapsed and have been swept away by the failure of the slopes.</p> <p>Higher ground is found to the west of the <span class=\"popular\">Khar Tak</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mkhar ltag</span> summit, but 15-m high vertical walls of the formation protect the high point of the castle. Small cobble wall segments are visible on the east side of the summit, yet most of these walls have disappeared along with parts of the summit. It appears that the summit hosted a single line of diminutive fortifications. Below the summit, the west face of the escarpment is lined with a cobble and block wall (10 m long). This must have once been part of a rampart, because there does not seem to be any other reason for wall remnants to be suspended in a vertical face some meters below the summit. </p> <h5 id=\"b1-1-65-4-2\">Cave complex of mkhar ltag </h5> <p>On a wide shelf below the cave complex of <span class=\"popular\">Khar Tak</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mkhar ltag</span>there are scattered cobbles, the detritus of past structures. According to a local account, a small <span class=\"popular emph\">Ch&ouml;rten</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mchod rten</span> was found in one of the caves until being destroyed in the Chinese Cultural Revolution.</p> <h5 id=\"b1-1-65-4-3\">Klu mkhar</h5> <p> <span class=\"popular\">Lukhar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Klu mkhar</span> is situated directly above the village of <span class=\"popular\">Rakkha Shak</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rag kha shag</span>. A gully separates it from <span class=\"popular\">Khar Tak</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mkhar ltag</span>, which lies to the north. The summit of <span class=\"popular\">Lukhar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Klu mkhar</span> rises some 40 m above he village. Only the west portion of the summit is still accessible. On the summit there are earthen wall fragments of fairly minor proportions, which appear to date to after 1000 CE. Below the summit on the flanks of he formation are various caves. A long cave at the eastern base of the formation is used for storage. No cobble walls were spotted at <span class=\"popular\">Lukhar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Klu mkhar</span>.</p> <table cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\" class=\"navarrows\"> <tbody> <tr> <td class=\"leftcell\"> <a class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-left.gif\" title=\"Previous Section\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"midcell\"> <a class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-up.gif\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"rightcell\"> <a class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-right.gif\" title=\"Next Section\"/> </a> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div id=\"chap-id\">/bellezza/b1-1-65/</div> <div style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\" class=\"jqmWindow\" id=\"chapRefWindow\"> <div class=\"closebtn\"> <a href=\"#\">Close</a> </div> <div style=\"height: 280px;\" class=\"conx-content\"> <h3>Note Citation for Page <span class=\"pgnm\"/> </h3> <p class=\"biblref\">John Vincent Bellezza, Antiquities of Zhang Zhung: A Comprehensive Inventory of Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Monuments on he Tibetan Upland (Charlottesville, VA 22904:Tibetan &amp; Himalayan Library, 2010), <span class=\"pgnm\"/>. </p> <h3>Bibliographic Citation</h3> <p>John Vincent Bellezza.
