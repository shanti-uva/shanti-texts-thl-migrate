The site, which is elevated 100 m above the village of <span class=\"popular\">Gobuk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mgo sbug</span>, is in direct view of <span class=\"popular\">Namtso</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gnam mtsho</span> situated 10 km to the south. Small springs are found in the vicinity of this lone residential structure. The well-built granite edifice (4.8 m x 7.5 m) has been largely reduced to fragmentary footings. It appears to have been split between two elevations (there is a 30 cm vertical difference between them). There may have been only one room in each of the two tiers. No standing walls remain at <span class=\"popular\">Khangp&eacute; Ky&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Khang pa&rsquo;i skyed</span>. The rear wall was built 60 cm into the slope. To the southeast of the structure there are the remains of footings, suggesting hat a walled courtyard once stood here. It appears to have been 7.5 m long and the width of the building itself. The courtyard was set about 70 cm below the lower tier of rooms. Foundation walls are of a random-rubble texture and contain large stones (30 cm to 1 m long). The ground plan of the edifice, its heavy wall traces and the presence of granite members up to 1.4 m in length on the site suggest that it was of all-stone construction. Next o the ruined edifice there is a <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma &#7751;i</span> wall with highly worn inscribed plaques that are likely to date to the time of the early <span class=\"popular emph\">Kagy&uuml;pa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">bka&rsquo; brgyud pa</span> masters. The impression received is that some of the archaic cultural ruin was dismantled o build this Buddhist monument, probably in order to pacify and requisition the site. An archaic cultural identity is best in keeping with the morphological and locational characteristics of <span class=\"popular\">Khangp&eacute; Ky&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Khang pa&rsquo;i skyed</span>. </p> <h4 id=\"b1-2-47-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>None appears to exist in nearby <span class=\"popular\">Gobuk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mgo sbug</span> village. If <span class=\"popular\">Khangp&eacute; Ky&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Khang pa&rsquo;i skyed</span> was indeed a Buddhist site, some recognition of its religious status is likely to have been preserved. </p> <table cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\" class=\"navarrows\"> <tbody> <tr> <td class=\"leftcell\"> <a class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-left.gif\" title=\"Previous Section\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"midcell\"> <a class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-up.gif\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"rightcell\"> <a class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-right.gif\" title=\"Next Section\"/> </a> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div id=\"chap-id\">/bellezza/b1-2-47/</div> <div style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\" class=\"jqmWindow\" id=\"chapRefWindow\"> <div class=\"closebtn\"> <a href=\"#\">Close</a> </div> <div style=\"height: 280px;\" class=\"conx-content\"> <h3>Note Citation for Page <span class=\"pgnm\"/> </h3> <p class=\"biblref\">John Vincent Bellezza, Antiquities of Zhang Zhung: A Comprehensive Inventory of Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Monuments on he Tibetan Upland (Charlottesville, VA 22904:Tibetan &amp; Himalayan Library, 2010), <span class=\"pgnm\"/>. </p> <h3>Bibliographic Citation</h3> <p>John Vincent Bellezza.
