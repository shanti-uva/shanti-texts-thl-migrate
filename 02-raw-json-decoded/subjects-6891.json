Gradually, many well-established families sold or rented out their residence in town and moved permanently to the new 'suburbs'. Located in a large garden, the original summerhouse has a generous south-facing window front, a separate kitchen and servant buildings. A monastery often has a summerhouse for the abbot in an adjacent garden\" (p. 61).\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eSource:\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eLarsen, Knud and Amund Sinding-Larsen. \u003cem\u003eThe Lhasa Atlas: Traditional Tibetan Architecture and Townscape\u003c/em\u003e.
