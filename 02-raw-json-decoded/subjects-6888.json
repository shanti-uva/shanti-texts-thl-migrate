In the \"Historical buildings in Lhasa\" table at the back of the book (pp. 165-172), buildings of the \"Streethouse\" type are designated with the letter \"H\" in the building type column. In the THL Place Dictionary, when a building has this feature type and the \u003cem\u003eLhasa Atlas\u003c/em\u003e is given as the source, it means that the building was designated with a \"H\" in the \u003cem\u003eLhasa Atlas\u003c/em\u003e table.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThis building type is described as follows:\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\"\u003cem\u003eH.

The streethouse is lit only from the street, and is often located on corners to increase the number of windows. Adjoining buildings behind it allow little space for the normal facilities of an independent building, and therefore the streethouse normally lacks its own latrine-tower. The streethouse type most likely developed as the town grew denser and as more marginal sites were used for commercial and residential construction. The streethouse always has shops on the ground floor.\" (p. 61).\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eSource:\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eLarsen, Knud and Amund Sinding-Larsen. \u003cem\u003eThe Lhasa Atlas: Traditional Tibetan Architecture and Townscape\u003c/em\u003e.
