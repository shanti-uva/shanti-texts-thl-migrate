The long stone rectangular base (9.4 m x 3.3 m x 2.4 m maximum) sits on a masonry plinth 70 cm in height. Upon the base are five cubic structures, four of which are capped by one or two graduated tabular structures.

Only desultory bits of what was probably more than one building have endured. A rear wall segment (6.6 m long) is built 1.3 m into he slope. This wall segment exhibits two buttresses, rounded corners and some overlapping among the upper courses of masonry, unmistakable \u003cspan class=\"popular emph\"\u003edo khang\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"scholar emph\"\u003erdo khang\u003c/span\u003e features.

On a wall fragment on the forward side of the RS1 dispersion there appears to be faint traces of two or three vertical courses of adobe blocks. The building of a now abandoned corral in the proximity may have played a part in the dissolution of the structures but slope failure is likely a bigger cause. To the west of RS1 there are he remains of a residential structure (3.1 m x 4.1 m) set on the tip of rock spur (47.190\u0026#900; / 11.114\u0026#900;). The seams of the slab walls of this structure (up to 1.1 m in height) contain copious amounts of a mud mortar. Running past this rock spur, at the edge of the slope between RS1 and RS2, there are what appear to be the remains of a retaining wall (around 80 cm in height). \u003c/p\u003e \u003ch5 id=\"b1-2-54-4-4\"\u003eResidential Structure RS2 \u003c/h5\u003e \u003cp\u003eResidential structure RS2 is a multi-roomed edifice sheltering at the base of a ridge (47.210\u0026#900; / 11.083\u0026#900;).

The integral entranceway (60 cm x 40 cm) accesses an interior space that is only 1.2 m deep and 85 cm high. The roof is made of corbels and slabs and is partially obscured by rubble.

Seven or 8 sizable buildings must have once stood here. This dispersion has forward freestanding wall segments up to 2 m in height. These were built without very substantial underlying revetments. Stone slabs of various lengths were used in construction (10 cm to 80 cm). These walls were heavily mud mortared, much of which has oozed out of the seams to cover sections of the stonework. In the remains of an upper edifice, a forward wall segment reaches 2.8 m in height on the exterior side and 2 m high on the interior, the difference being accounted for by a revetment. There is a window in this forward wall (35 cm x 40 cm) with a 70-cm long lintel. The rear wall of the same edifice is set 1.8 m below the upper slope. In the bottom of the rear wall there are wo deep recesses (east: 45 cm x 35 cm x 1.2 m, west: 55 cm x 35 cm x 1 m). This rear wall was part of a large irregularly shaped room (4.9 m x 3.8 m) and has one buttress partly intact as well. Such large sequestered rooms may possibly have had a ceremonial function, with the recesses representing sacred spaces of some kind (we might speculate that chthonic forces were propitiated here). \u003c/p\u003e \u003ch5 id=\"b1-2-54-4-9\"\u003eResidential Structure RS7\u003c/h5\u003e \u003cp\u003eResidential structure RS7 (38.5 m x 18.5 m) is situated northeast of RS6 at the same elevation.

This is also indicated by the relative state of preservation of the ceremonial and residential juxtapositions. In the valley bottom between RS9 and RS10 there is slab wall (11.7 m long) embedded in the ground. It is aligned to the slope gradient above, not to the cardinal directions. Such structures are commonly associated with Upper Tibetan funerary sites. \u003c/p\u003e \u003ch5 id=\"b1-2-54-4-12\"\u003eResidential Structure RS10\u003c/h5\u003e \u003cp\u003eResidential structure RS10 (50 m x 15 m) is another multi-roomed dispersion at the base of the slope (47.283\u0026#900; / 10.970\u0026#900;). A number of buildings were established here but little is left.

The base (4.2 m x 2.4 m x 2 m) supports two cubic structures upon which there is a single unit of five graduated tiers.

Three walls remain standing in this structure, which are between 1 m and 1.6 m in height. It appears that adobe blocks were sandwiched between the stone slabs of these walls. Above hese ruins there is a masonry platform with a rudimentary prayer flag mast (47.313\u0026#900; / 10.892\u0026#900; / 4320 m).

Having collected more information on the moumental assemblage of Upper Tibet since that time, I am now of the opinion that they have a non-Buddhist identity. This is indicated by their unsual design characteristics and their placement exclusively among archaic cultural mouments. At this juncture, the age of these ceremonial structures cannot be pinpointed. Given the evidence an early historic period origin must be entertained. \u003c/div\u003e \u003ctable cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\" class=\"navarrows\"\u003e \u003ctbody\u003e \u003ctr\u003e \u003ctd class=\"leftcell\"\u003e \u003ca class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"\u003e \u003cimg src=\"/global/images/arrow-left.gif\" title=\"Previous Section\"/\u003e \u003c/a\u003e \u003c/td\u003e \u003ctd class=\"midcell\"\u003e \u003ca class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"\u003e \u003cimg src=\"/global/images/arrow-up.gif\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"/\u003e \u003c/a\u003e \u003c/td\u003e \u003ctd class=\"rightcell\"\u003e \u003ca class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"\u003e \u003cimg src=\"/global/images/arrow-right.gif\" title=\"Next Section\"/\u003e \u003c/a\u003e \u003c/td\u003e \u003c/tr\u003e \u003c/tbody\u003e \u003c/table\u003e \u003c/div\u003e \u003cdiv id=\"chap-id\"\u003e/bellezza/b1-2-54/\u003c/div\u003e \u003cdiv style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\" class=\"jqmWindow\" id=\"chapRefWindow\"\u003e \u003cdiv class=\"closebtn\"\u003e \u003ca href=\"#\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/div\u003e \u003cdiv style=\"height: 280px;\" class=\"conx-content\"\u003e \u003ch3\u003eNote Citation for Page \u003cspan class=\"pgnm\"/\u003e \u003c/h3\u003e \u003cp class=\"biblref\"\u003eJohn Vincent Bellezza, Antiquities of Zhang Zhung: A Comprehensive Inventory of Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Monuments on he Tibetan Upland (Charlottesville, VA 22904:Tibetan \u0026amp; Himalayan Library, 2010), \u003cspan class=\"pgnm\"/\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e \u003ch3\u003eBibliographic Citation\u003c/h3\u003e \u003cp\u003eJohn Vincent Bellezza.
