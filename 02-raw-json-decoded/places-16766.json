Bounding the village to the northeast is a range with a rock outcrop also called <span class=\"popular\">Nyenmar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gnyan dmar</span>. This is the local territorial deity (<span class=\"popular\">y&uuml;llha</span><span class=\"scholar\">Yul lha</span>), who is considered a bodyguard (<span class=\"popular emph\">kusung</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">sku srung</span>) in the circle of the <span class=\"popular\">Tago</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rta rgo</span> mountain gods. At <span class=\"popular\">Nyenmar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gnyan dmar</span> there are at least seven funerary structures spread out across the sandy plain on the outskirts of the village. This mortuary site is divided by a gully into south and north sectors. </p> <h4 id=\"b2-2-14-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>On the shores of <span class=\"popular\">Dangra Gyutso</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dang ra g.yu mtsho</span>, structures such as those found at <span class=\"popular\">Nyenmar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gnyan dmar</span> are considered the tombs of the ancient <span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span>. Funerary structure FS5, the largest funerary structure at <span class=\"popular\">Nyenmar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gnyan dmar</span>, is locally known as <span class=\"popular\">Tso Deugo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gtso rde&rsquo;u mgo</span> (Chieftain&rsquo;s Head Hill). It is thought to be the burial mound of an ancient <span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span> chieftain.</p> <h4 id=\"b2-2-14-4\">Site elements</h4> <h5 id=\"b2-2-14-4-1\">South sector</h5> <h6 class=\"essay\">Funerary Structure FS1</h6> <p>Funerary structure FS1 (8 m x 8 m) is a square tumulus raised 80 cm above the surrounding terrain (30&deg; 53.628&#900; N. lat. / 86&deg; 37.605&#900; E. long. / 4650 m). There are no coherent wall segments left in this rock and earthen mound. FS1 seems to have been aligned in the cardinal directions. Stones up to 50 cm in length went into its construction.</p> <h6 class=\"essay\">Funerary Structure FS2</h6> <p>Funerary structure FS2 (14.5 m x 5.5 m minimum) is situated 3 m east of FS1. The fragmentary walls of this double-course enclosure are flush with the ground surface. The width of FS2 is uncertain because many stones have been removed in order to build walls in the settlement of <span class=\"popular\">Nyenmar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gnyan dmar</span>. Stones up to 50 cm in length went into building FS2.</p> <h6 class=\"essay\">Funerary Structure FS3</h6> <p>Funerary structure FS3 (6 m across) is a highly deteriorated enclosure situated 25 m north of FS2. The remaining wall segments are around 90 cm thick and contain variable length (up to 60 cm long) stones flush with the ground surface.</p> <h6 class=\"essay\">Funerary Structure FS4</h6> <p>Funerary structure FS4 (9 m across) is another highly dissolute funerary structure situated 25 m north of FS3. </p> <h6 class=\"essay\">Funerary Structure FS5</h6> <p>Funerary structure FS5 (18 m x 18 m), the largest funerary structure at <span class=\"popular\">Nyenmar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gnyan dmar</span>, is situated 98 m north of FS4. This square tumulus (<span class=\"popular emph\">bangso</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">bang so</span>) is elevated about 1.7 m above the surrounding plain. Only tiny wall sections are still extant along the flanks of this rock and earthen mound. The random-rubble double-course fragments that have survived are composed of smaller stones. Reportedly, in the 1980s, stones were extracted from FS5 in order to build adjacent houses. Interestingly, several years after being built, hese houses were abandoned, probably because of the perceived negative effects associated with using stones from a so-called <span class=\"popular emph\">m&ouml;n dur</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mon dur</span>. Roughly 70 m northwest of FS5 here is a small rocky tumulus (under 50 cm high) on which old <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma &#7751;i</span> plaques rest. This may be another funerary structure.</p> <h5 id=\"b2-2-14-4-2\">North sector</h5> <h6 class=\"essay\">Funerary Structure FS6</h6> <p>Funerary structure FS6 (11.5 m x 12.5) is situated on the north side of a gully that cuts through the benches of <span class=\"popular\">Nyenmar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gnyan dmar</span> (53.934&#900; / 37.492&#900; / 4640 m). Although all four walls of this enclosure are intact, there is no discernable coherence to these structures. The walls are flush with the ground surface and their corners are rounded. Stone piled inside the enclosure were probably removed from the perimeter walls affecting the integrity of FS6.</p> <h6 class=\"essay\">Funerary Structure FS7</h6> <p>Funerary structure FS7 (6.5 m) is a highly dissolute structure situated immediately north of FS6. FS7 appears o be identical in construction to FS6. </p> <table cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\" class=\"navarrows\"> <tbody> <tr> <td class=\"leftcell\"> <a class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-left.gif\" title=\"Previous Section\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"midcell\"> <a class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-up.gif\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"rightcell\"> <a class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-right.gif\" title=\"Next Section\"/> </a> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div id=\"chap-id\">/bellezza2/b2-2-14/</div> <div style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\" class=\"jqmWindow\" id=\"chapRefWindow\"> <div class=\"closebtn\"> <a href=\"#\">Close</a> </div> <div style=\"height: 280px;\" class=\"conx-content\"> <h3>Note Citation for Page <span class=\"pgnm\"/> </h3> <p class=\"biblref\">John Vincent Bellezza, Antiquities of Zhang Zhung: A Comprehensive Inventory of Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Monuments on he Tibetan Upland (Charlottesville, VA 22904:Tibetan &amp; Himalayan Library, 2010), <span class=\"pgnm\"/>. </p> <h3>Bibliographic Citation</h3> <p>John Vincent Bellezza.
