From the site there are wide views in all directions. The terrain is sandy and rocky, well drained and slightly inclined to the west. A link road runs right past the site and there are several <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma ṇi</span> walls in the vicinity. <span class=\"popular\">Khyiu Durtr&ouml;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Khyi&rsquo;u dur khrod</span> is the most westerly example of the pillars enclosed within an enclosure (II.1b) typology surveyed to day.</p> <h4 id=\"b2-1-53-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>The less than flattering name <span class=\"popular\">Khyiu Durtr&ouml;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Khyi&rsquo;u dur khrod</span> hints at an archaic funerary function for the site. No other information was forthcoming.</p> <h4 id=\"b2-1-53-4\">Site elements</h4> <h5 id=\"b2-1-53-4-1\">Enclosure</h5> <p>The enclosure is generally aligned in the cardinal directions and measures 10.5 m (north-south) x 6 m (east-west). This enclosure is designed in the extreme western Tibet regional fashion with longer north-south dimensions. The enclosure is somewhat elevated above the surrounding plain. Parts of all four double-course walls (50 cm to 70 cm thick) have survived. These walls are primarily built of igneous cobbles 20 cm to 30 cm in length. These stones are even with the ground surface or project above it to a maximum height of 10 cm. There is a possible funerary superstructure (8 m across) located 14 m southeast of the enclosure. However, no coherent wall fragments have endured in this structure.</p> <h5 id=\"b2-1-53-4-2\">Pillars</h5> <p>It is reported by villagers of nearby <span class=\"popular\">Trashi Gang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bkra shis sgang</span> that two pillars stood on the west end of the enclosure until the Chinese Cultural Revolution. One was broken but its base was left anchored in the substrate. This pillar base is situated next to he inner edge of the west wall, 4 m from the southwest corner of the enclosure. The broken top of this highly weathered four-sided pillar still lies on the site. It is 65 cm long and has a girth of 85 cm. It is reported hat the other pillar stood near the northwest corner of the enclosure. This specimen had a total length of around 1.5 m. It was ripped out of the ground and used in the construction of a water channel feeding a grinding mill.</p> <table class=\"navarrows\" cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\"> <tbody> <tr> <td class=\"leftcell\"><a class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"> <img title=\"Previous Section\" src=\"../../../../../global/images/arrow-left.gif\" alt=\"\" /> </a></td> <td class=\"midcell\"><a class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"> <img title=\"Beginning of Article\" src=\"../../../../../global/images/arrow-up.gif\" alt=\"\" /> </a></td> <td class=\"rightcell\"><a class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"> <img title=\"Next Section\" src=\"../../../../../global/images/arrow-right.gif\" alt=\"\" /> </a></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div id=\"chap-id\">/bellezza2/b2-1-53/</div> <div id=\"chapRefWindow\" class=\"jqmWindow\" style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\"> <div class=\"closebtn\"><a href=\"#\">Close</a></div> <div class=\"conx-content\" style=\"height: 280px;\"> <h3>Note Citation for Page <span class=\"pgnm\"> </span></h3> <p class=\"biblref\">John Vincent Bellezza, Antiquities of Zhang Zhung: A Comprehensive Inventory of Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Monuments on he Tibetan Upland (Charlottesville, VA 22904:Tibetan &amp; Himalayan Library, 2010), <span class=\"pgnm\">. </span></p> <h3>Bibliographic Citation</h3> <p>John Vincent Bellezza.
