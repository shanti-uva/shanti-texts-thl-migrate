However, instead of an intervening esplanade, the slope it sits upon is directly connected to the eastern range of badlands. The site has a very good defensive posture and was virtually invulnerable from attack arising in any direction. Very little structural evidence has survived, probably in part, because the earthen formation it sits upon has been subject to rapid erosion and the periodic catastrophic failure of the slopes. The lower site, set directly below the upper site, consists of rubble-strewn surfaces and depressions extending over an area of 200 m x 60 m. The structures on this moderate slope have been heavily impacted by the construction of a masonry wall that runs along the entire length of the site near its lower reaches. </p> <h4 id=\"b1-1-62-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>According to local villagers, <span class=\"popular\">Dosham M&ouml;n Gi Y&uuml;l</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mdo gsham mon gyi yul</span> was a castle and village of the ancient <span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span>. This site is considered inauspicious and cries are said to emanate from it. Local residents allege that gold, banded agates (<span class=\"popular emph\">zi</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">gzi</span>), turquoise, and other valuables were at one time recovered here. It is also reported that ceramic vessels full of bones were discovered in the vicinity. Urn burials are sometimes reported from other parts of Upper Tibet as well.</p> <h4 id=\"b1-1-62-4\">Site elements</h4> <h5 id=\"b1-1-62-4-1\">Upper site </h5> <p>On a 34-m long 8-m to 10-m wide ridge-crest there are small fragments of cobble- and block- wall footings. Below the sheer walls of the summit are structural vestiges that resemble ramparts. On the lower or west end of he ridge-crest there is a 15-m long bluff in which masonry and adobe blocks are embedded. These wall remnants are up to 4 m in height. The masonry walls exhibit a texture of alternating courses of stone blocks and cobbles (up to 50 cm in length). The presence of these tall well-designed structures may suggest that significant buildings once stood here. Below the bluff there is a ridge-prow (23 m x 21 m) that hosts highly obscured traces of wall-footings. These also appear to have been building foundations of some kind.</p> <h5 id=\"b1-1-62-4-2\">Lower Site</h5> <p>The lower site is elevated 5 m to 20 m above the valley floor. It appears that much of the detritus of the original structures was exploited to make the large wall that now dominates the site. This wall, built before living memory, has the design characteristics of a <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma &#7751;i</span> wall, but no inscribed plaques are found on it. It may have been constructed to subdue the inauspicious (non-Buddhist) aura of the site and to modify its archaic architectural character. Perhaps he resources to furnish it with religious plaques were never realized. On the south end of the lower site of <span class=\"popular\">Dosham M&ouml;n Gi Y&uuml;l</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mdo gsham mon gyi yul</span>there is indeed a <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma &#7751;i</span> wall with plaques of varying ages. The highly eroded specimens of the six-syllable mantra in <span class=\"popular emph\">lentsa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">lan tsha</span> script may well date to the second diffusion of Buddhism (<span class=\"popular emph\">tenpa chidar</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">bstan pa phyi dar</span>). Particularly at the northern end of the site, there are a series of shallow depressions that appear to be consistent with residential foundations. If so, this would corroborate local claims that this was once a (<span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span>) village. Only one integral wall on the edge of a depression was detected. This 4.5-m long double-course wall segment is around 60 cm wide and appears to have formed part of the corner of a foundation. A wall fragment of he same general type and length is found clinging to a slope above the south end of the lower site. In the middle of the site there is yet another in situ wall, built into the edge of a 4-m high bluff. This wall is 5.6 m long and less than 50 cm in elevation.</p> <h4 id=\"b1-1-62-5\">Affiliated sites</h4> <h5 id=\"b1-1-62-5-1\">mdo gsham mug mkhar dgon</h5> <p>The current village of <span class=\"popular\">Dosham</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mdo gsham</span> is situated on the west side of the valley opposite <span class=\"popular\">Dosham M&ouml;n Gi Y&uuml;l</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mdo gsham mon gyi yul</span>. Reportedly, it has 16 households and a population of around 80. Further downstream, where the <span class=\"popular\">Dosham</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mdo gsham</span> valley enters a defile, there are the remains of the impressive Buddhist monastic complex of <span class=\"popular\">Dosham Mukkhar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mdo gsham mug mkhar</span>. This sprawling installation clearly indicates that a much larger population once inhabited the valley. It is said to have received its name from the many pigeons found here (in the <span class=\"popular\">Ngari</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mnga&rsquo; ris</span> dialect <span class=\"popular emph\">mukgu</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mug gu </span>means pigeon). Situated on he right or east side of the valley, large mud-brick and rammed-earth buildings line the summit and sides of a large formation. The mesa-like formation blanketed in ruins is reminiscent of nearby <span class=\"popular\">Tsarang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rtsa rang</span> (A-62), although <span class=\"popular\">Dosham Mukkhar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mdo gsham mug mkhar</span> is somewhat smaller. It is said that a functioning monastery, a branch facility of <span class=\"popular\">Toding</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mtho lding</span>, existed at the site until the Chinese Cultural Revolution. Only one <span class=\"popular emph\">Ch&ouml;rten</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mchod rten</span> in <span class=\"popular\">Khadampa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Kha dam pa</span> style is still maintained at <span class=\"popular\">Dosham Mukkhar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mdo gsham mug mkhar</span>. Interestingly, local villagers also refer to the summit complex as <span class=\"popular\">Mukhar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Smu mkhar</span>; <span class=\"popular emph\">mu</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">smu</span> being a kind of mythical monster of ancient times. The <span class=\"popular emph\">mu</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">smu</span> is widely encountered in the mythology of <span class=\"popular\">Gug&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ge lho smad</span>. This myth may preserve a historical memory of the archaic occupation of the <span class=\"popular\">Dosham Mukkhar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mdo gsham mug mkhar</span> site. This view is given weight by the fact that the site, with its extensive summit and strategic position above a defile, is probably the most desirable spot for habitation in the <span class=\"popular\">Dosham</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mdo gsham</span> valley. We must, therefore, consider the possibility that, in the archaic cultural horizon, the two so-called <span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span> sites of the valley (A-110, A-111) were subsidiary to this location in terms of population and cultural significance. In keeping with this hypothesis, it would appear that the two minor &lsquo;<span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span>&rsquo; sites were not the object of Buddhist resettlement, while the chief archaic site of <span class=\"popular\">Dosham</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mdo gsham</span> was thoroughly redeveloped. </p> <table cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\" class=\"navarrows\"> <tbody> <tr> <td class=\"leftcell\"> <a class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-left.gif\" title=\"Previous Section\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"midcell\"> <a class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-up.gif\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"rightcell\"> <a class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-right.gif\" title=\"Next Section\"/> </a> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div id=\"chap-id\">/bellezza/b1-1-62/</div> <div style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\" class=\"jqmWindow\" id=\"chapRefWindow\"> <div class=\"closebtn\"> <a href=\"#\">Close</a> </div> <div style=\"height: 280px;\" class=\"conx-content\"> <h3>Note Citation for Page <span class=\"pgnm\"/> </h3> <p class=\"biblref\">John Vincent Bellezza, Antiquities of Zhang Zhung: A Comprehensive Inventory of Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Monuments on he Tibetan Upland (Charlottesville, VA 22904:Tibetan &amp; Himalayan Library, 2010), <span class=\"pgnm\"/>. </p> <h3>Bibliographic Citation</h3> <p>John Vincent Bellezza.
