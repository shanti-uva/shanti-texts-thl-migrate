The site is situated on a prominence overlooking the southern edge of a small plateau. The view east of <span class=\"popular\">Gyaplung Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rgyab lung rdo ring</span> is closely hemmed in by a ridge, an unusual geographic orientation for Upper Tibetan funerary sites. The terrain is moderately sloping and sandy. Although rocks are scattered around the proximity, there are no definite signs that the pillars of <span class=\"popular\">Doring Gyablung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo ring rgyab lung</span> were enclosed. The quite severe gradient of the site is not in conformance with the customary topographical placement of this monument typology. The 11 in situ pillars of the site are gray to red color. The pillars, standing on high ground, overlook the five funerary enclosures of the site. The uncut menhirs are tilted at various angles, heavily worn and discolored. While the broad faces of the tabular specimens tend to face north and south, there are considerable variations (probably, at least in part, due to geomorphologic changes). </p> <h4 id=\"b2-1-43-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>According to local sources, a primordial monument.</p> <h4 id=\"b2-1-43-4\">Site elements</h4> <h5 id=\"b2-1-43-4-1\">Pillars</h5> <p>From south to north, the pillars of <span class=\"popular\">Doring Gyablung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo ring rgyab lung</span> have the following dimensions and forms:</p> <ol> <li>Long-stone DR1: tabular (90 cm [height] x 1 m [basal girth]). This is an outlying specimen.</li> <li>Long-stone DR2: irregularly shaped (50 cm x 60 cm). This is also an outlying specimen.</li> <li>Long-stones DR3 to DR8 form an uneven line of pillars:</li> <li>Long-stone DR3: four-sided (80 cm x 50 cm). To the south of DR3 there is an uprooted pillar (1.1 m x 60 cm [girth]).</li> <li>Long-stone DR4: tabular (1.1 m x 70 cm).</li> <li>Long-stone DR5: tabular (1.2 m x 90 cm).</li> <li>Long-stone DR6: four-sided (1 m x 70 cm).</li> <li>Long-stone DR7: probably broken (30 cm x 40 cm). </li> <li>Long-stone DR8: probably broken (20 cm x 40 cm).</li> <li>Long-stones DR9 to DR11 form another grouping.</li> <li>Long-stone DR9: tabular (1.4 m x 90 cm).</li> <li>Long-stone DR10: tabular (65 cm x 1 m).</li> <li>Long-stone DR11: tabular (90 cm x 1 m).</li> </ol> <p>Immediately north of the pillars there is an incomplete enclosure (18 m across) that was built on a broad slope. The north wall is missing in this structure. The perimeter walls are of an indeterminate construction ype. They are composed of both slabs and blocks that average 30 cm to 40 cm in length. This structure is likely o be funerary in function.</p> <h5 id=\"b2-1-43-4-2\">Funerary superstructures</h5> <p>The five double-course enclosures of <span class=\"popular\">Doring Gyablung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo ring rgyab lung</span> are found on a gently inclined broad slope. The terrain is gravel strewn and almost devoid of vegetation. These five structures are equidistant from the group of pillars, forming an arc around hem. They appear to have been quadrate and possibly ovoid in form, and were constructed primarily with blocky stones. </p> <h6 class=\"essay\">Funerary Structure FS1</h6> <p>Funerary structure FS1 (5.6 m x 6.3 m) is situated 60 m west of the pillars at approximately 10 m lower elevation (29&deg; 52.372&#900; N. lat. / 84&deg; 10.302&#900; E. long). Most stones in the perimeter walls of this poorly preserved enclosure are even with the ground surface, but a few rise slightly above it.</p> <h6 class=\"essay\">Funerary Structure FS2</h6> <p>Funerary structure FS2 (7.7 m x 8 m) is situated 10 m north/upslope of FS1. The walls (50 cm to 70 cm thick) of this quadrate double-course enclosure are relatively intact, and are composed of upright blocks and slabs (primarily 30 cm to 50 cm long). These stones protrude as much as 20 cm above the ground surface.</p> <h6 class=\"essay\">Funerary Structure FS3</h6> <p>Funerary structure FS3 (6 m across) is situated 23 m northeast of FS2 and somewhat upslope (52.394&#900; / 10.321&#900;). FS3 is a poorly preserved specimen.</p> <h6 class=\"essay\">Funerary Structure FS4</h6> <p>Funerary structure FS4 is situated 12 m east of FS3 and slightly upslope (52.396&#900; / 10.328&#900;). Little remains of this structure.</p> <h6 class=\"essay\">Funerary Structure FS5</h6> <p>Funerary structure FS5, the highest elevation funerary superstructure at the site, is situated 58 m north of he pillars (52.395&#900; / 10.337&#900;). About 50 percent of its double-course upright block walls (40 cm thick) are intact. These stones (average length around 30 cm) are flush with the ground level or elevated, up to 15 cm higher. </p> <table cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\" class=\"navarrows\"> <tbody> <tr> <td class=\"leftcell\"> <a class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-left.gif\" title=\"Previous Section\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"midcell\"> <a class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-up.gif\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"rightcell\"> <a class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-right.gif\" title=\"Next Section\"/> </a> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div id=\"chap-id\">/bellezza2/b2-1-43/</div> <div style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\" class=\"jqmWindow\" id=\"chapRefWindow\"> <div class=\"closebtn\"> <a href=\"#\">Close</a> </div> <div style=\"height: 280px;\" class=\"conx-content\"> <h3>Note Citation for Page <span class=\"pgnm\"/> </h3> <p class=\"biblref\">John Vincent Bellezza, Antiquities of Zhang Zhung: A Comprehensive Inventory of Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Monuments on he Tibetan Upland (Charlottesville, VA 22904:Tibetan &amp; Himalayan Library, 2010), <span class=\"pgnm\"/>. </p> <h3>Bibliographic Citation</h3> <p>John Vincent Bellezza.
