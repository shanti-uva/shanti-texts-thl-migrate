To the west, the site is closely bound by the ridge hat encloses the basin. There are wide views in all other directions. The well-drained terrain is nearly level, sandy and gravelly. <span class=\"popular\">Doring Barma</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo ring bar ma</span> consists of a large funerary mound (<span class=\"popular emph\">bangso</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">bang so</span>) and at least one other funerary structure. In close proximity there is a shepherd&rsquo;s camp with a few small corrals, which is occupied in the springtime. Many of the walls of the funerary structures were dismantled in order to build this camp. Uncut beige and reddish volcanic (?) stones of variable length (15 cm to 60 cm long) were used to construct he archaeological structures. Stones are scattered all around the site, detritus from the funerary monuments. There is a spring in the vicinity, a fairly unusual occurrence at ancient funerary sites. The name suggests that at one time there was one or more standing stones at <span class=\"popular\">Doring Barma</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo ring bar ma</span>, but evidence of their existence was not discovered. Another seasonal <span class=\"popular emph\">drok pa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">&rsquo;brog pa</span> camp in the area known as<span class=\"popular\">Doring Lhoma</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo ring lho ma</span> may also have had menhirs, but no archaeological remains were detected there. On the other hand, at <span class=\"popular\">Doring Jangma</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo ring byang ma</span> (C-5), another locale in the area, there are two isolated pillars.<a href=\"#n76\" name=\"nb76\" class=\"note\">76</a> </p> <h4 id=\"b2-2-80-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>Although the structures of <span class=\"popular\">Doring Barma</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo ring bar ma</span> are called &lsquo;<span class=\"popular\">m&ouml;n dur</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon dur</span>&rsquo; by local residents, their function is no longer clear to them.</p> <h4 id=\"b2-2-80-4\">Site elements</h4> <h5 id=\"b2-2-80-4-1\">Funerary Structure FS1</h5> <p>Funerary structure FS1 is a large quadrate mound aligned in the cardinal directions. It measures 14 m (north-south) x 15.5 m (east-west), and is elevated 1.5 m to 2 m above the surrounding terrain. In the middle of he top of the tumulus there is a stone-filled depression. This shows that, at some time in the past, FS1 was opened by vandals. Just below the rim of the mound there are double-course wall fragments (around 40 cm thick). Such walls must have lined each side of the structure. The longest of these double-course wall fragments (2.3 m) runs along the west rim of the structure. There is also a small fragment of a herringbone wall course on one flank of the mound, indicating that it once boasted extensive and elaborate stonework. Below the north and west sides of the mound are remnants of slab and block walls. These constitute ancillary funerary structures whose configuration is no longer discernable. The longest of these outlying wall segments (3 m long, 40 cm thick) is found to the north of the mound. This north-south oriented, double-course wall is composed of blocks laid flat on the ground. A few old plaques inscribed with the <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma &#7751;i</span> mantra have been placed on the mound. Fortunately, FS1 no longer appears to be mined for stones. </p> <h5 id=\"b2-2-80-4-2\">Funerary Structure FS2</h5> <p>Funerary structure FS2 (3.8 m x 3.7 m) is situated 43 m west of FS1 at a slightly higher elevation. This quadrate, double-course enclosure is also aligned in the compass points. Some parts of FS2 are level with the ground surface while other parts are elevated as much as 50 cm above the adjacent ground. Only small fragments of the double-course perimeter walls have survived.</p> <hr class=\"footnote-divider\"/> <h2>Notes</h2> <div class=\"footnote\"> <a name=\"n76\"/> <a href=\"#nb76\" class=\"note\"> [76] </a> Bellezza, <em>Antiquities of Northern Tibet</em>, 162. </div> <table cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\" class=\"navarrows\"> <tbody> <tr> <td class=\"leftcell\"> <a class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-left.gif\" title=\"Previous Section\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"midcell\"> <a class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-up.gif\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"rightcell\"> <a class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-right.gif\" title=\"Next Section\"/> </a> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div id=\"chap-id\">/bellezza2/b2-2-80/</div> <div style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\" class=\"jqmWindow\" id=\"chapRefWindow\"> <div class=\"closebtn\"> <a href=\"#\">Close</a> </div> <div style=\"height: 280px;\" class=\"conx-content\"> <h3>Note Citation for Page <span class=\"pgnm\"/> </h3> <p class=\"biblref\">John Vincent Bellezza, Antiquities of Zhang Zhung: A Comprehensive Inventory of Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Monuments on he Tibetan Upland (Charlottesville, VA 22904:Tibetan &amp; Himalayan Library, 2010), <span class=\"pgnm\"/>. </p> <h3>Bibliographic Citation</h3> <p>John Vincent Bellezza.
