FS1 is not aligned in he cardinal directions. It has unusually designed perimeter walls composed of small pieces of white limestone and a brown sedimentary rock (8 cm to 15 cm long), which were set in the ground edgewise. The perimeter walls are of the multiple-course variety and still exhibit quite a bit of structural coherence. Most of the stones in he perimeter walls are even with the ground surface, while some project above it as much as 10 cm. The two shorter walls of the enclosure appear to consist of four parallel rows of stones, while the two long sides have as many as seven rows of parallel stones. The central portions of the two long walls bulge out. </p> <p>Funerary structures FS2 and FS3 are situated under twin rocky mounts. These two enclosures are mostly built of light-colored limestone. </p> <h5 id=\"b2-2-68-4-2\">Funerary Structure FS2</h5> <p>Funerary structure FS2 (5.4 m x 5.4 m) is a partly intact quadrate enclosure whose perimeter walls are composed of larger uncut stones (up to 90 cm long) (58.172&#900; / 01.640&#900; / 4560 m). Virtually no coherent wall fragments are left. The remaining in situ stones are even with the ground surface or project above it to a maximum height of 25 cm. </p> <h5 id=\"b2-2-68-4-3\">Funerary Structure FS3</h5> <p>Funerary structure FS3 (3.2 m x 3.6 m) is a double-course quadrate enclosure aligned in the cardinal directions (58.054&#900; / 01.818&#900; / 4530 m). Most of the stones in the outer courses of the perimeter walls have disappeared, while the inner courses are largely intact. Variable-length (20 cm to 75 cm long) stones were used to construct he enclosure walls. These stones are even with the ground surface or project above it to a maximum height of 20 cm. </p> <table cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\" class=\"navarrows\"> <tbody> <tr> <td class=\"leftcell\"> <a class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-left.gif\" title=\"Previous Section\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"midcell\"> <a class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-up.gif\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"rightcell\"> <a class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-right.gif\" title=\"Next Section\"/> </a> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div id=\"chap-id\">/bellezza2/b2-2-68/</div> <div style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\" class=\"jqmWindow\" id=\"chapRefWindow\"> <div class=\"closebtn\"> <a href=\"#\">Close</a> </div> <div style=\"height: 280px;\" class=\"conx-content\"> <h3>Note Citation for Page <span class=\"pgnm\"/> </h3> <p class=\"biblref\">John Vincent Bellezza, Antiquities of Zhang Zhung: A Comprehensive Inventory of Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Monuments on he Tibetan Upland (Charlottesville, VA 22904:Tibetan &amp; Himalayan Library, 2010), <span class=\"pgnm\"/>. </p> <h3>Bibliographic Citation</h3> <p>John Vincent Bellezza.
