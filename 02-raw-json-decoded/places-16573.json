The important <span class=\"popular\">Gug&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ge</span> agricultural enclave of <span class=\"popular\">Shangts&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Shang rtse</span> still boasts a relatively high volume perennial stream. On the op of the formation there is a rammed-earth and adobe block carcass (approximately 14 m x 8 m), which faces southeast towards the <span class=\"popular\">Shangts&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Shang rtse</span> valley. The severe gradient of the slope suggests that this single edifice was split between three different elevations. Most of the structure, however, has disappeared down the slopes. <span class=\"popular\">Shangts&eacute; B&ouml;n Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Shang rtse bon mkhar</span> commands an excellent position over the north side of the broad <span class=\"popular\">Shangts&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Shang rtse</span> valley, supporting its stronghold attribution in the oral tradition. Arrayed below the summit are 12 to 15 shallow caves that were once inhabited. The scant structural evidence remaining is insufficient to positively identify <span class=\"popular\">Shangts&eacute; B&ouml;n Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Shang rtse bon mkhar</span> as an archaic facility. </p> <h4 id=\"b1-1-91-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>According to <span class=\"popular\">Shangts&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Shang rtse</span> township elders, <span class=\"popular\">Shangts&eacute; B&ouml;n Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Shang rtse bon mkhar</span> was an ancient Bon castle. This is verified in a manuscript entitled <span class=\"popular emph\">T&ouml; Ngari Shangts&eacute; G&ouml;n Gi Logy&uuml; Dord&uuml;</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">Stod mnga&rsquo; ris shang rtse dgon gi lo rgyus mdor sdus</span>, by <span class=\"popular\">S&ouml;nam Dorj&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bsod nams rdo rje</span>. The information pertaining to <span class=\"popular\">Shangts&eacute; B&ouml;n Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Shang rtse bon mkhar</span> in this eight page manuscript came from the <span class=\"popular\">Gug&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ge</span> physician, <span class=\"popular\">Penden Yesh&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dpal ldan ye shes</span> (a disciple of <span class=\"popular\">Kyungtr&uuml;l Namkha Jikm&eacute; Dorj&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Khyung sprul nam mkha&rsquo; &rsquo;jigs med rdo rje</span> (died 1956)). It records that the Bonpo of prehistoric <span class=\"popular\">Zhang Zhung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Zhang zhung</span> had their <span class=\"popular emph\">khar</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mkhar</span> built on a square knob to the west of the main shang rtse mkhar. It is stated that many Bon folios were buried in the caves at <span class=\"popular\">Shangts&eacute; B&ouml;n Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Shang rtse bon mkhar</span>, among which was a Bon divination text. </p> <h4 id=\"b1-1-91-4\">Site elements</h4> <h5 id=\"b1-1-91-4-1\">Castle</h5> <p>The little of the carcass that remains has undergone quite a bit of erosion, but the earthen walls have retained much of their mass (they are around 50 cm thick). The uppermost portion of the outer wall of the structure (the bulk of what still exists) appears to be primarily composed of rammed-earth. The orifices for the shuttering pins are regularly distributed across this wall segment (maximum height: 2.5m). Each orifice has a small stone header. There are also a few unbaked mud-brick wall fragments that formed interior wall partitions, but they are too heavily degraded to yield information on the ground plan of the facility. In several of the caves there are Buddhist <span class=\"popular emph\">Tsatsa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">tshwa tshwa </span> (votive clay plaques) with impressions of <span class=\"popular emph\">Ch&ouml;rten</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mchod rten</span>, <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma &#7751;i</span> mantras, the god phyag na rdo rje, and a sitting lokesvara (?). These <span class=\"popular emph\">Tsatsa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">tshwa tshwa</span> appear to mark the symbolic occupation of the site by the Buddhists. No Buddhist monuments, however, appear to have been founded here. </p> <h4 id=\"b1-1-91-5\">Affiliated sites</h4> <h5 id=\"b1-1-91-5-1\">Shang rtse mkhar</h5> <p>On a hill above the north side of the <span class=\"popular\">Shangts&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Shang rtse</span> township headquarters there is a large cave complex and the extensive remains of a monastery known as <span class=\"popular\">Shangrap Tenjampa Ling</span><span class=\"scholar\">Shang rab brtan byams pa gling</span>. Reportedly, a fortress occupied the summit (25 m x 11 m). The ruins here consist of substantial adobe walls built upon cobble foundations set at various levels. The fortress site is situated approximately 2 km east of <span class=\"popular\">Shangts&eacute; B&ouml;n Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Shang rtse bon mkhar</span>. Dating to after 1000 CE, shang rtse mkhar appears to have been well integrated into the Buddhist infrastructure of the site. <span class=\"popular\">Guge Tsering Gyelpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ge tshe ring rgyal po</span> reports that the kings of <span class=\"popular\">Gug&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ge</span> spent their summers at shang rtse mkhar (a cooler location than <span class=\"popular\">Tsarang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rtsa rang</span>).<a href=\"#n68\" name=\"nb68\" class=\"note\">68</a> The entire monastic complex was destroyed in the Chinese Cultural Revolution and no attempt has been made to rebuild any of it. A new Buddhist temple has been established in the valley bottom. With over 100 caves, the troglodytic settlement of <span class=\"popular\">Shangts&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Shang rtse</span> must have constituted the heart of residency in the <span class=\"popular\">Shangts&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Shang rtse</span> valley. This locale is rich in arable land, much of which is still under cultivation. Given its natural endowments, the shang rtse mkhar site may also have been an important habitational center in the archaic cultural horizon. There is no obvious reason why the early inhabitants of the region would have chosen to ignore this prime location for the far less valuable site to the west. The much smaller and more marginal site of <span class=\"popular\">Shangts&eacute; B&ouml;n Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Shang rtse bon mkhar</span> may be where the Bonpo (either physically or symbolically) were shunted to after the <span class=\"popular emph\">tenpa chidar</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">bstan pa phyi dar</span> and the Buddhist domination of <span class=\"popular\">Gug&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ge</span>. </p> <hr class=\"footnote-divider\"/> <h2>Notes</h2> <div class=\"footnote\"> <a name=\"n68\"/> <a href=\"#nb68\" class=\"note\"> [68] </a> <span class=\"popular\">Guge Tsering Gyelpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ge tshe ring rgyal po</span>, <span class=\"popular emph\">nga ri ch&ouml; jung</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">Mnga&rsquo; ris chos &rsquo;byung</span>, 235. </div> <table cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\" class=\"navarrows\"> <tbody> <tr> <td class=\"leftcell\"> <a class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-left.gif\" title=\"Previous Section\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"midcell\"> <a class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-up.gif\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"rightcell\"> <a class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-right.gif\" title=\"Next Section\"/> </a> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div id=\"chap-id\">/bellezza/b1-1-91/</div> <div style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\" class=\"jqmWindow\" id=\"chapRefWindow\"> <div class=\"closebtn\"> <a href=\"#\">Close</a> </div> <div style=\"height: 280px;\" class=\"conx-content\"> <h3>Note Citation for Page <span class=\"pgnm\"/> </h3> <p class=\"biblref\">John Vincent Bellezza, Antiquities of Zhang Zhung: A Comprehensive Inventory of Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Monuments on he Tibetan Upland (Charlottesville, VA 22904:Tibetan &amp; Himalayan Library, 2010), <span class=\"pgnm\"/>. </p> <h3>Bibliographic Citation</h3> <p>John Vincent Bellezza.
