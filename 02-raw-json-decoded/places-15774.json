History</h4> <p>The bo township of mDzod dge county is geographically and traditionally part of The bo county in present day Kan lho Prefecture, Kansu Province. In the 13th Rab yung (1747-1806), at the time of gZa&rsquo; ru Khro rgyal, the chief of the gZa&rsquo; ru tribe, there was a village called Bon sde stod ma near gTso tshang Monastery (No.91), whose religious gathering place was a temple of A skyid sKyang tshang Monastery (No.194) in Ma ru village of gZa&rsquo; ru tribe where a few monks lived, known as Bon sde stod ma. But as the religious practitioners did not live according to monastic vows, it was decided that the monastery should be moved to a more isolated spot. Thus A tshogs tshang of A skyid sKyang tshang Monastery bought the present site of the monastery in exchange for a white cow and other goods. The new monastery was named Nyos zhing, literally &ldquo;field that was bought&rdquo;. After the monastery was completed, the monasteries of sKyang tshang, gTso tshang and the local lay community decided that since it was A tshogs tshang who built the monastery, it would remain a branch of sKyang tshang Monastery, but that since it was located nearer gTso tshang, the latter would take charge of the monastery and the chief of the local gZa&rsquo; ru tribe would be the monastery&rsquo;s patron. The agreement was committed to writing and signed by all parties. Thus rGyal ba g-yung drung phun tshogs of sKyang tshang and gYung drung bstan &rsquo;dzin of gTso tshang are counted as the first of its patriarchs.</p> <ol type=\"1\"> <li>rGyal ba g-yung drung phun tshogs and gYung drung bstan &rsquo;dzin</li> <li>gTso bla bSod nams phun tshogs alias A bsod tshang </li> <li>gTso bla bDe chen dbang &rsquo;dus </li> <li>gTso bla bSod nams dbang grags </li> <li>gTso dbon bsTan &rsquo;dzin dbang rgyal alias A khu bsTan rgyal tshang, also known as gTso dbon rgan </li> <li>gTso dbon Zla ba rgyal mtshan, a nephew of the 5th </li> <li>gTso dGra &rsquo;dul mgon po (1932-1971) was recognized as the rebirth of A khu bsTan rgyal tshang by gTso dbon Zla ba rgyal mtshan.

It is also spelt dGu ba, because the monastery faces a range of nine mountains collectively known as Go tshang spun dgu, the &ldquo;nine brothers of Go tshang mountain&rdquo; (which is also the name of nine local tribes).</p> <h4 id=\"b6-15-6-2\">2. Location</h4> <p>The monastery is located 61 km east of county town of mDzod dge.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-15-6-3\">3. History</h4> <p>A few years before the introduction of the Rab byung chronology that begins with the year 1027, a Bonpo called sKyang rtse Nyi ma grags pa opened a hermitage near Sa ral village, west of rTsub ma&rsquo;i la dmar on the flank of Mount Go tshang in mDzod dge. Later, in the 1st Rab byung (1027-1086), his son &rsquo;Bum skyabs, who was also called sKyang rtse tshang, built a temple at the hermitage which attracted an increasing number of practitioners. </p> <p>A brother of &rsquo;Bum skyabs known as sKyang rtse &rsquo;Phags pa skyabs was regarded as a great saint. He is often called simply sKyang &rsquo;phags (DzNGL p.52). He was one of the Three Bonpo Saints of Amdo and founded Thang zhing gYung drung gling Monastery above Thang zhing village in the 2nd Rab byung (1087-1146). This monastery was also known as Nyin ka Monastery.</p> <p>bSod nams &rsquo;bum, the chief of sGur ba valley, built a residence for sKyang &rsquo;phags and his family, to ensure his family&rsquo;s descent and gave him seven families to serve him. For this reason, sKyang &rsquo;phags is regarded as the first master of all the monasteries belonging to the sKyang tshang lineage. In order to establish a real monastery, sKyang &rsquo;phags chose a site known as Gling &rsquo;og, but it was not built in his lifetime. </p> <p>Following is a list of the masters in the sKyang &rsquo;phags lineage:</p> <ol type=\"1\"> <li>sKyang &rsquo;phags</li> <li>Thog rgod nam mkha&rsquo; rgyal mtshan, one of three sons of sKyang &rsquo;phags, moved the temple of Sa ral to Gling &rsquo;og and renamed it rNam rgyal lha khang.
