This is the site of extremely important Bon pictographs (J-16). The south-facing cave consists of one large chamber, 48 m long and 4.5 m to 9 m in width. The mouth of the cave is roughly 10 m in height and above the entrance there is a natural skylight. The floor gradually rises towards the rear of the cave and the ceiling tapers downwards but this grotto remains spacious in all places. The structural remnants found in and around <span class=\"popular\">Gars&ouml;l Drakpuk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sgar gsol brag phug</span> appear to be just a small portion of what once stood in this cave. These various walls and footings seem to have had both residential and ceremonial functions. The large size of the cave and its substantial anthropogenic modification point to the existence of a significant archaic cultural installation. Most of the rock paintings are found on the right wall of the cave. The lofty location and the presence of Bon pictographs probably identify <span class=\"popular\">Gars&ouml;l Drakpuk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sgar gsol brag phug</span> as an early Bon religious center. </p> <h4 id=\"b1-2-39-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>Some local <span class=\"popular emph\">drok pa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">&rsquo;brog pa</span> maintain that <span class=\"popular\">Guru Rinpoch&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ru rin po che</span> visited<span class=\"popular\">Gars&ouml;l Drakpuk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sgar gsol brag phug</span>.</p> <h4 id=\"b1-2-39-4\">Site elements</h4> <h5 id=\"b1-2-39-4-1\">Fa&ccedil;ade </h5> <p>Outside the mouth of the cave grotto there are the remains of stone steps flanked by masonry walls, which line each side of the entrance. These walls extend for 8 m and join the vestiges of an elaborate fa&ccedil;ade that spanned he mouth of the cave. The 50-cm to 70-cm thick cave fa&ccedil;ade that barricaded the mouth of the grotto is partially intact along its east and west extremities. The fa&ccedil;ade was skillfully built with a random-rubble texture, and contains stones that average 20 cm to 30 cm in length (full range: 15 cm to 50 cm long). Copious amounts of mud-mortar were applied to the wall joints. The east segment of the fa&ccedil;ade is 5.5 m in length and up to 5 m in height. The west fragment of the fa&ccedil;ade is 7.5 m in length and a maximum of 4 m in height. The base of a room (2.1 m x 1.5 m) elevated above the cave floor is ensconced in the west portion of the fa&ccedil;ade. </p> <h5 id=\"b1-2-39-4-2\">Internal cave structures</h5> <p>Behind the cave front, wall-footings line each side of the narrowest portion of <span class=\"popular\">Gars&ouml;l Drakpuk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sgar gsol brag phug</span>. These walls are 5 m in length, a maximum of 1.5 m in width and 30 cm to 40 cm in height. What kind of structure they contributed towards is not known. Farther back, on the right side of the cave, there is an enclosure (13 m x 5 m), which is also composed of masonry footings. These wall remains are about 60 cm wide and elevated around 50 cm above the floor of the cave. </p> <hr class=\"footnote-divider\"/> <h2>Notes</h2> <div class=\"footnote\"> <a name=\"n90\"/> <a href=\"#nb90\" class=\"note\"> [90] </a> This site was documented by <span class=\"popular\">Pel Riwa Lozang Tashi</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dpal ri ba blo bzang bkra shis</span> in 2001. </div> <table cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\" class=\"navarrows\"> <tbody> <tr> <td class=\"leftcell\"> <a class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-left.gif\" title=\"Previous Section\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"midcell\"> <a class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-up.gif\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"rightcell\"> <a class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-right.gif\" title=\"Next Section\"/> </a> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div id=\"chap-id\">/bellezza/b1-2-39/</div> <div style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\" class=\"jqmWindow\" id=\"chapRefWindow\"> <div class=\"closebtn\"> <a href=\"#\">Close</a> </div> <div style=\"height: 280px;\" class=\"conx-content\"> <h3>Note Citation for Page <span class=\"pgnm\"/> </h3> <p class=\"biblref\">John Vincent Bellezza, Antiquities of Zhang Zhung: A Comprehensive Inventory of Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Monuments on he Tibetan Upland (Charlottesville, VA 22904:Tibetan &amp; Himalayan Library, 2010), <span class=\"pgnm\"/>. </p> <h3>Bibliographic Citation</h3> <p>John Vincent Bellezza.
