The matter was settled through offers of compensation: firstly, by offering the lady Kong bza\u0026rsquo; khri lcam to sTon pa gShen rab as his wife; secondly, by offering bushels of gold and turquoise; and thirdly, Kong rje, the king of the demons, offered himself and his subjects, who then became sTon pa gShen rab\u0026rsquo;s attendants.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003esTon pa gShen rab then buried many treasures, including the gold and turquoise he received, at the foot of the craggy hills that looked like scattered jewels, so that they would be the essence of the soil of the four quarters of Tibet. Saying prayers to the nectar-producing bough of Kong btsun De mo, he thrust it into the ground there as a sign of eternity.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOn top of Mount gNyan, he also planted a juniper tree as tall as himself, where handprints of his four distinguished disciples still remain. The tree is called sKu tshad sku shug ldem drug. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHe preached the Bon of the Nine Vehicles and he, himself being the lord of the dMu lineage, identified a mountain and gave it the name dMu ri smug po. This is the central peak of Mount Bon ri. The summit is also called lHa ri gyang tho. He entrusted the local deities who reside on various peaks to guard the treasures he had concealed: gYung drung lha gnyan rtsal as the guardian of treasure in the centre, Gangs gnyan stag rtse as the king of the east, Nyang lha btsan drug as the king of the north, bDud nag rngams sgra sgrogs as the king of the west and gYu \u0026rsquo;od sman btsun as the goddess of the south. Kong btsun De mo is the overall protectress of the place and rDzu \u0026rsquo;phrul klu dbang is the special protector of treasures.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe sacred mountain Bon ri and its surroundings became a centre of the teachings of Bon. gNya\u0026rsquo; khri btsan po is said to have descended from the sky onto the summit lHa ri Gyang tho. He was the first king of Tibet. Co\u0026rsquo;u and \u0026rsquo;Tshe mi were the first religious attendants of the king; between them and the king there was the \u0026ldquo;priest-patron\u0026rdquo; relationship. The king and his religious attendants resided at the foot of Mount dMu ri smug po and inspired the spreading of the Bon teachings.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSince then a number of the \u003cspan xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"\u003egshen\u003c/span\u003e religious practitioners have come up to this holy place and established places for religious practice. dMu ri smug po, the main peak of Mount Bon ri, is the very highest among the peaks, which include lHa ri Gyang tho, Nor bu ri and gShen ri bde ldan. On the slopes and in the valleys of Mount Bon ri, there were the following religious sites: Srid rgyal, sTag bro sa, dGyes ri, dGon rnying, Srin mo phug, dBus phug, Yang dben, Bya de phug, lHa ri Gyang tho, gSang gling, Phug gu, Nyi ma phug, sNang ngog, Thugs dkar brag, Brag dkar zhabs rjes, rDzong chung steng, Shel sku sbug and the cemetery Mi yul skyid mthing. Mount Bon ri is, therefore, not only a special place for the Bonpo, but Buddhists as well, who join in its veneration.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMount Bon ri still receives a stream of pilgrims who accumulate merit by making circumambulations and many prostrations. Mount Bon ri and its surroundings present unearthly scenery, with the beautiful high mountains filled with pine trees, bamboo, medicinal herbs, flowers, herbivores and various kinds of birds.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThere were periods of great celebration in the vicinity of the mountain. One of the major festivities in a cycle of twelve years was an event called Nyang po lha gsol, held in the tiger year, from the 1st to the 8th day of the eighth month. During this period, people got together in the seven Bonpo monasteries, including sNang ngog, and went through the ceremonies, true to the time-honoured tradition, of initiation, the fortune-call ritual and religious dances. The lay folk also performed dances, horse-racing, horseback archery and the fortune-call parade.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn the mouse year, on the 8th day of the eighth month, there was the performance of the fortune-call ceremony by the religious practitioners, and dances and songs by the lay folk, as in the case of the tiger year. The origin of this festival goes back to a Bonpo hermit:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn the Sixth Rab byung (1327-1386) a lama of Shel zhig from the Khams province rediscovered a crystal image of sTon pa gShen rab called Dri med shel sku, in the place called Shel sku sbug, and took it back to Khams. Similarly, three text-rediscoverers from Khyung po found, in Thugs dkar brag, a conch believed to be self-grown from the teeth of sTon pa gShen rab and took it back to Khyung po. Following that, in Kong po, a mountain crumbled, rainfall became rare, fields produced little harvest, disease spread among people and cattle, famine struck and many other disasters ensued, which reduced the people to a state of helplessness. During this time, the hermit dPon gsas Ri pa \u0026rsquo;brug gsas was in meditation at the cave Thod g-yu phug in Nying khri. The hermit understood the reason for the disasters and said, \u0026ldquo;The fertility of the soil had been weakened because of the excavation of the treasures, the image Dri med shel sku and the tooth conch.\u0026rdquo; He therefore made the people perform the ritual of propitiation dedicated to the local deities and the fortune-call ceremony. When these ceremonies ended, rain began to fall, people had a good harvest and the epidemic abated.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe local people propitiated the goddess Srid pa rgyal mo in her various aspects: at Srid rgyal Monastery, it was dKar mo Srid rgyal; at rDzong chung steng Monastery, sMug mo Srid rgyal; and at sTag bro sa, Srid rgyal drel nag. The people of the three villages of Nya mgor propitiated the goddess A ma Yu mo. They also kept the tradition of performing the \u003cspan xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"\u003ebsang\u003c/span\u003e ritual on the 15th and 30th of every month at different sacred sites of Mount Bon ri where there were special signs, such as footprints of early sages on rocks. This holy mountain, to which all devotees pay homage and make pilgrimages, is one of the most important religious sites in the world and, as such, it is well known.\u003c/p\u003e \u003ch4 id=\"b5-2-6-2\"\u003e(88) Srid rgyal Monastery\u003c/h4\u003e \u003cp\u003eSrid rgyal dgon chen is situated close to Nying khri rdzong, halfway up the holy mountain Bon ri. Cars can reach the foot of the mountain.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOne of the thirty-seven centres of Bon was rKong yul Se mo thang. These centres were established during the time of Mu khri btsan po, a son of gNya\u0026rsquo; khri btsan po. It is at Se mo thang in Kong po that Srid rgyal Monastery is located.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe lineage of lamas of this monastery goes back to Ri pa \u0026rsquo;Brug gsas. He is said to have been the emanation of the tutelary deity sTag la med \u0026rsquo;bar. A historical document states:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;In the land called Bon ri\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThere will be a hermit named \u0026rsquo;Brug gsas\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWho will possess a \u0026lsquo;magic-stone\u0026rsquo;,\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWill be courageous and avert wars,\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAnd guide 300,000 people to salvation.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAnyone who contacts him will be rewarded.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThis hermit was born in 1270 in rDza rong into the clan of sMa ra. sMa ra is a subdivision of the clan Rang bya. He was the second son of dKon cog dge, the father, and A lcam U gu, the mother. Having been in religious service until the age of thirteen years, he was given the name \u0026rsquo;Brug gsas rgyal. From the time he was fourteen until he was nineteen years of age, he practised meditation. He then listened to various masters in China, \u0026rsquo;Jang and Mi nyag. He then became conscious of the impermanence of life. He therefore travelled to Central Tibet and began to practise more meditation, as well as to perform circumambulation around sacred sites such as Ti se, Ma pang, Bye ma g-yung drung and sPos ri ngad ldan. He then travelled down to Kong po in accordance with a prophecy of Srid pa rgyal mo. In 1330, he \u0026ldquo;opened the door of Bon ri\u0026rdquo; (that is to say, he identified the mountain), because people had forgotten the fact that the place was one of the thirty-seven religious centres of Bon. This was due to the long period of time that passed since sTon pa gShen rab\u0026rsquo;s visit to the place and also due to the chequered history of the Bon religion.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u0026rsquo;Brug gsas took up residence in the cave gYu phug, near which the three streams of Nyang meet. He remained there in meditation for three years and countenanced deities of tranquil and wrathful aspects from whom he received more prophecies. He was able to make the eight kinds of demons serve him. While devoting himself to retreat-practice of Khro bo and Phur pa on the mountain, he received signs from the goddess dKar mo Srid rgyal for founding a monastery at this place. He therefore founded Srid rgyal Monastery there. The interior and exterior of the monastic buildings were of good design and their religious contents were rich. More than one hundred monks from all directions gathered together there.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHe left traces of his body and footprints on rocks around the site of the monastery and passed away at the age of eighty. He promised that he would come back in the form of a bird to see the monastery every year on the 13th day of the fourth Tibetan month. A festival called dGon chen Bya mjal was, thereafter, held on this day and it was the occasion when people went to see the bird.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe line of the heads of the monastery was as follows:\u003c/p\u003e \u003col type=\"1\"\u003e \u003cli\u003e Ri pa \u0026rsquo;Brug gsas\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003e Rag shi Nyi ma rgyal mtshan\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003e Bru ston Nyi ma rgyal mtshan\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003e La tri hri rda (Zhang zhung language: Dam pa blo gros)\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003e sDong sgom bsTan pa lhun grub\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003e rNal \u0026rsquo;byor Nam mkha\u0026rsquo; lhun grub\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003e Tshe dbang lhun grub\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003e bsTan pa rgyal mtshan\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003e gYung drung rnam rgyal\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003e Rin chen tshul khrims\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003e Kun bzang lhun grub\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003e rGyal ba gtsug phud\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003e Tshe dbang legs mchog\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003e gYung drung rgyal mtshan\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003e rGyal ba blo gros\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003e Mi \u0026rsquo;gyur rgyal mtshan\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003e lHun grub dbang rgyal\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003e gYung drung dbang rgyal\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003e Tshe dbang \u0026rsquo;od zer\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003e Khyung sprul gYung drung phun tshogs\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003e Zla ba don \u0026rsquo;grub\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003e Tshul khrims blo gros\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003e mTha\u0026rsquo; yas rgya mtsho\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003e Nor skyabs Rinpoche\u003c/li\u003e \u003c/ol\u003e \u003cp\u003eDam pa blo gros, the fourth in the line, founded the monastery called rDzong chung kha. gDong sgom bsTan pa lhun grub, the fifth, founded sTag rtse Monastery (No.89) in his later life. bsTan pa rgyal mthan, the eighth, carried out all the duties delegated to him by sPyan gsal Kun \u0026rsquo;phel gling, an official serving under the Fifth Dalai Lama (1617-1682).
