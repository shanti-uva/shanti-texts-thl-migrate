In the \"Historical buildings in Lhasa\" table at the back of the book (pp. 165-172), buildings of the \"Clustered housing\" type are designated with the letter \"J\" in the building type column. In the THL Place Dictionary, when a building has this feature type and the <em>Lhasa Atlas</em> is given as the source, it means that the building was designated with a \"J\" in the <em>Lhasa Atlas</em> table.<br /><br />This building type is described as follows:<br /><br />\"<em>J. Clustered housing</em>. Example: Sh&ouml;l East cluster (301-303).<br /><br />\"Lower social strata in Lhasa lived in simpler single-storey, mud brick buildings, often clustered with animal pens and outbuildings. Very few of this building type remain, with some examples in Sh&ouml;l. They are in many respects similar to the traditional rural housing cluster\" (p. 61).<br /><br />Source:<br /><br />Larsen, Knud and Amund Sinding-Larsen. <em>The Lhasa Atlas: Traditional Tibetan Architecture and Townscape</em>.
