In the \"Historical buildings in Lhasa\" table at the back of the book (pp. 165-172), buildings of the \"Clustered housing\" type are designated with the letter \"J\" in the building type column. In the THL Place Dictionary, when a building has this feature type and the \u003cem\u003eLhasa Atlas\u003c/em\u003e is given as the source, it means that the building was designated with a \"J\" in the \u003cem\u003eLhasa Atlas\u003c/em\u003e table.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThis building type is described as follows:\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\"\u003cem\u003eJ.
