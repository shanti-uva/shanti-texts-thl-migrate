The site has long views to the east. Most other views from this sheltered location are constrained by the local topography. <span class=\"popular\">Nakgyam</span><span class=\"scholar\">Nag gyam</span> consists of not less than six funerary structures built of unshaped light-colored metamorphic rocks (?), which are generally 20 cm to 80 cm in length. In addition to more minor structural traces, major structures may have been overlooked during the survey because of the large and diffuse nature of the <span class=\"popular\">Nakgyam</span><span class=\"scholar\">Nag gyam</span> site. Also, these superficial funerary structures are not so easy to recognize among the naturally occurring rocky convolutions of the site. <span class=\"popular\">Nakgyam</span><span class=\"scholar\">Nag gyam</span> was well suited to funerary activities, as this location is not particularly conducive to pastoral, agricultural or settlement activities. </p> <h4 id=\"b2-2-77-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>According to local sources, <span class=\"popular\">Nakgyam</span><span class=\"scholar\">Nag gyam</span> is associated with the ancient <span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span>.</p> <h4 id=\"b2-2-77-4\">Site elements</h4> <h5 id=\"b2-2-77-4-1\">Funerary Structure FS1</h5> <p>Funerary structure FS1 (3 m x 1.5 m) is situated on a wide bench above the valley floor (30&deg; 15.234&#900; N. lat. / 84&deg; 28.957&#900; E. long.). It is the most southerly specimen at <span class=\"popular\">Nakgyam</span><span class=\"scholar\">Nag gyam</span>. FS1 is a fragmentary single-course rectangular enclosure whose perimeter walls are flush with the surface or which rise above it to a height of 20 cm. Small stones are scattered over he enclosure, many of which are partially submerged. </p> <h5 id=\"b2-2-77-4-2\">Funerary Structure FS2</h5> <p>Funerary structure FS2 (12 m x 13 m) is a highly dissolute round enclosure (15.395&#900; / 28.873&#900;). It is not clear whether the perimeter had orderly wall courses, heaped-stone walls or a combination thereof. The interior is free of structural elements save for a small pile of stones in the middle. </p> <h5 id=\"b2-2-77-4-3\">Funerary Structure FS3</h5> <p>Funerary structure FS3 (12 m x 13 m) is situated 10.5 m northwest of FS2 in the same small hollow. This highly deteriorated, sub-rectangular enclosure appears to have had a heaped-stone wall perimeter. A few stones are strewn around the interior of the enclosure. </p> <h5 id=\"b2-2-77-4-4\">Funerary Structure FS4</h5> <p>Funerary structure FS4 (17 m x 14 m) is situated immediately north of FS2 and FS3 in another hollow (15.526&#900; / 28.787&#900;). FS4 appears to have consisted of two interconnected irregularly shaped cells. Most of this highly fragmentary enclosure exhibits a heaped-stone wall perimeter. There is also a double-course wall segment (8 m long, 1 m thick) of upright stones on the east side of the structure. </p> <h5 id=\"b2-2-77-4-5\">Funerary Structure FS5</h5> <p>Funerary structure FS5 (17 m x 13 m) is an ovoid enclosure with both double-course and heaped-stone walls (15.526&#900; / 28.845&#900;). On the uphill side of the structure, the perimeter is comprised of a random-rubble dry-mortar wall (60 cm high) that was built into the side of the hollow. The interior of FS5 is free of structural elements. Mostly larger stones were used to construct FS5.</p> <h5 id=\"b2-2-77-4-6\">Funerary Structure FS6</h5> <p>Funerary structure FS6 occupies another hollow (15.631&#900; / 28.729&#900;). This structure is elevated about 50 cm above ground level. Its perimeter consists of double-course walls (around 60 cm thick). The south wall of FS6 is he most intact. The interior of this structure is almost completely sheathed in stones with no ordered stonework discernable. FS6 (6 m x 6.3 m) has two sides that are indented to create a modified L-shaped plan. These indentations in the walls are 1.7 m and 2.6 m in length. </p> <h5 id=\"b2-2-77-4-7\">Funerary Structure FS7</h5> <p>Funerary structure FS7 (15 m x 9 m), a sub-rectangular enclosure, is situated 11 m north of FS6. This hard to recognize heaped-stone wall structure was built with rocks up to 1 m in length. The perimeter walls are 50 cm to 1.2 m in height. The interior of the enclosure is somewhat depressed. </p> <h5 id=\"b2-2-77-4-8\">Funerary Structure FS8</h5> <p>Funerary structure FS8 is a sub-rectangular enclosure from which many stones have been extracted (15.703&#900; / 28.685&#900;). A contemporary charnel ground (<span class=\"popular emph\">durtr&ouml;</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">&rsquo;dur khrod</span>) is located in the vicinity, and the removal of stones from FS8 may be related to this cultural feature. </p> <table cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\" class=\"navarrows\"> <tbody> <tr> <td class=\"leftcell\"> <a class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-left.gif\" title=\"Previous Section\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"midcell\"> <a class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-up.gif\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"rightcell\"> <a class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-right.gif\" title=\"Next Section\"/> </a> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div id=\"chap-id\">/bellezza2/b2-2-77/</div> <div style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\" class=\"jqmWindow\" id=\"chapRefWindow\"> <div class=\"closebtn\"> <a href=\"#\">Close</a> </div> <div style=\"height: 280px;\" class=\"conx-content\"> <h3>Note Citation for Page <span class=\"pgnm\"/> </h3> <p class=\"biblref\">John Vincent Bellezza, Antiquities of Zhang Zhung: A Comprehensive Inventory of Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Monuments on he Tibetan Upland (Charlottesville, VA 22904:Tibetan &amp; Himalayan Library, 2010), <span class=\"pgnm\"/>. </p> <h3>Bibliographic Citation</h3> <p>John Vincent Bellezza.
