Name</h4> <p>sGur skyang is the abbreviation of sGur ba sKyang tshang; the monastery&rsquo;s full name is sGur ba sKyang tshang dgon rnam rgyal kun grags gling. sGur ba is the name of the valley where the monastery is located. It is also spelt dGu ba, because the monastery faces a range of nine mountains collectively known as Go tshang spun dgu, the &ldquo;nine brothers of Go tshang mountain&rdquo; (which is also the name of nine local tribes).</p> <h4 id=\"b6-15-6-2\">2. Location</h4> <p>The monastery is located 61 km east of county town of mDzod dge.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-15-6-3\">3. History</h4> <p>A few years before the introduction of the Rab byung chronology that begins with the year 1027, a Bonpo called sKyang rtse Nyi ma grags pa opened a hermitage near Sa ral village, west of rTsub ma&rsquo;i la dmar on the flank of Mount Go tshang in mDzod dge. Later, in the 1st Rab byung (1027-1086), his son &rsquo;Bum skyabs, who was also called sKyang rtse tshang, built a temple at the hermitage which attracted an increasing number of practitioners. </p> <p>A brother of &rsquo;Bum skyabs known as sKyang rtse &rsquo;Phags pa skyabs was regarded as a great saint. He is often called simply sKyang &rsquo;phags (DzNGL p.52). He was one of the Three Bonpo Saints of Amdo and founded Thang zhing gYung drung gling Monastery above Thang zhing village in the 2nd Rab byung (1087-1146). This monastery was also known as Nyin ka Monastery.</p> <p>bSod nams &rsquo;bum, the chief of sGur ba valley, built a residence for sKyang &rsquo;phags and his family, to ensure his family&rsquo;s descent and gave him seven families to serve him. For this reason, sKyang &rsquo;phags is regarded as the first master of all the monasteries belonging to the sKyang tshang lineage. In order to establish a real monastery, sKyang &rsquo;phags chose a site known as Gling &rsquo;og, but it was not built in his lifetime. </p> <p>Following is a list of the masters in the sKyang &rsquo;phags lineage:</p> <ol type=\"1\"> <li>sKyang &rsquo;phags</li> <li>Thog rgod nam mkha&rsquo; rgyal mtshan, one of three sons of sKyang &rsquo;phags, moved the temple of Sa ral to Gling &rsquo;og and renamed it rNam rgyal lha khang. The new complex became known as rNam rgyal kun grags gling or more commonly as dGu ba sKyang tshang Monastery. He remained there as head of the monastery, while Thogs med, his brother, married to continue the hereditary succession. </li> <li>Grags pa dbang rgyal (b.1148), founder of bSam &rsquo;grub Monastery (No.197) </li> <li>gYung drung thos grol, moved rNam rgyal lha khang of Nyin ka and the temple of Ra sngon &rsquo;bri sde from sTag ra to Gling &rsquo;og </li> <li>bSod nams bzang po alias rGyal ba rgya mtsho, founder a monastery in Shar khog (Zung chu) in the Iron-Tiger year of the 15th Rab byung (1290)</li> <li>Rin chen blo gros, built a temple dedicated to the Eighty Saints in the monastery and also supervised sKyang tshang Monastery (No.202) in Shar khog</li> <li>bDud &rsquo;dul dbang grags </li> <li>gYung drung bstan rgyal </li> <li>dKon mchog yon tan </li> <li>rNam rgyal thogs med</li> <li>The last four (7-10) masters also looked after sKyang tshang monastery in Shar khog.</li> <li>rNam rgyal bstan &rsquo;dzin, also active in Chu nag valley (which now belongs to the Nine Villages of gZi tsha) </li> <li>gTsug phud tshul khrims, founder a small monastery called mGon po near Tshal rang village in the rTa ra dri ri area in the lower reaches of The chu river </li> <li>Nyi ma &rsquo;bum. He wanted the practitioners in the monastery to observe strict monastic discipline but was unable to impose it in his lifetime. </li> <li>Shes rab rgyal mtshan, went to sMan ri Monastery (No.1) in gTsang with several companions to order to receive ordination and when he returned to the monastery, he imposed strict monastic discipline following his predeccesor&rsquo;s wishes. He also built a temple called Dri med khang bzang in Thang zhing for those practitioners who did not wish to take monastic vows immediately. </li> <li>Seng ge gling grags, built a residence for the sKyang &rsquo;phags lineage at dGa&rsquo; ldan hermitage in Bab bzo, founded by sKyang &rsquo;phags and initiated the tradition of sending a master from sGur skyang to the hermitage. </li> <li>gYung drung bstan pa&rsquo;i rgyal mtshan, travelled to Central Tibet for several years and reinforced monastic discipline in the monastery. He helped dBang ldan grags pa of A skyid sKyang tshang monastery (No.194) to move Dar rgyas lha rtse, Phag rgod establishments to gYung drung bstan rgyas gling and developed close ties between A skyid and sGur skyang monasteries.</li> <li>Nam mkha&rsquo; ye shes built a temple in each of the following places: &rsquo;A zha, sTag ra and Nyag ra, with the intention of founding monasteries there. </li> <li>Kun bzang lhun grub, built a temple at the monastery dedicated to Kun bzang rgyal ba &rsquo;dus pa </li> <li>gYung drung lhun grub, built a temple in lDong ti and also founded sTag skyong Monastery (No.211) in rTsub ma which now belongs to the Nine Villages of gZi tsha county </li> <li>Ngag dbang bstan &rsquo;dzin </li> <li>Rin chen rgyal mtshan, born in the17th century.
