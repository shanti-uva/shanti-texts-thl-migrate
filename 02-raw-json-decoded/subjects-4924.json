This also covers clans, religious lineages, and other such corporate entities.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eObviously there are category differences here between a discrete physical item like a bridge - its building, repair, destruction, rebuilding, and so forth - and a more abstract entity like monastic corporation or a province, and even more so a clan. We have tried in the subcategories to use flexible nomenclature\u0026nbsp; that can cover the full spectrum. One reason is that organizations and buildings often go hand in hand - the beginning of a monastery is generally identified with the building of an initial set of physical structures. Another reason is that by using the same categories for the full spectrum, it is easy to see the coincidence of like events - what types of things are created, for example, in a given time period?\u003c/p\u003e","source_url":null,"is_primary":true,"created_at":"2013-09-15 04:14:36 UTC","updated_at":"2013-09-15 04:14:36 UTC","authors":[{"id":"2","fullname":"David Germano"}]}]}
