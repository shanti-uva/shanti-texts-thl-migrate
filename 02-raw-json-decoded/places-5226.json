It is first and foremost located on the vast and mountainous \u003cspan class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\"\u003eTibetan plateau\u003c/span\u003e located north of the famed Himalayan mountain range to the south. However, it actually extends also to areas to the south and west of the plateau, and also far to the north, to areas quite distant from the Himalayas themselves. Dating back to the seventh century with the rise of the great Tibetan empire, the Tibetan people are characterized as those who share a literary language with a huge corpus, who speak a family of closely connected languages (sometimes called \"dialects\"), who are mostly Buddhist or B\u0026ouml;npo in religious affiliation, and who adhere to a dense web of shared cultural conceptions, identity, practices, and narratives of origins and history. Tibet has been famous since at least the twelfth century as a citadel of Buddhist spirituality, learning, and monasticism, and in particular for being home to the fullest expression of tantric Buddhism. An extension of this religious fame has been the establishment of an even larger zone of cultural influence that extends to Mongolia in the far north west, Bhutan to the south, southern areas of Russia, and also to other areas. In addition to its religious fame, Tibet of course is also home to some of the highest mountain peaks and most mountainous terrain on the planet, with ecologies that dramatically vary from a lunar landscape in the west to lush forests in the east. Most Tibetans continue to be farmers or nomadic pastoralists.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn modern times, the traditional homelands of Tibetan people are carved up between four different modern nation states: China, Nepal, India, and Pakistan. The vast bulk of Tibetan areas are now incorporated into five Chinese provinces: the Tibet Autonomous Region, Qinghai, Sichuan, Gansu, and Yunnan. In addition there is a modern diaspora of Tibetans, especially in Nepal and India, but also throughout the world, which is centered around Dharmasala, India, where His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama resides with his government-in-exile. Tibetans also have strong regional identity, with the most famous cultural regions being \u003cspan class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\"\u003e\u0026Uuml;tsang\u003c/span\u003e (central, \u003cem\u003e\u003cspan class=\"place\" title=\"F15355\"\u003edbus\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"place\" title=\"F15354\"\u003egtsang\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e), \u003cspan class=\"place\" title=\"F5225\"\u003eKham\u003c/span\u003e (east, \u003cem\u003e\u003cspan class=\"place\" title=\"F5225\"\u003ekhams\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e), and \u003cspan class=\"place\" title=\"F15348\"\u003eAmdo\u003c/span\u003e (northeast, \u003cem\u003e\u003cspan class=\"place\" title=\"F15348\"\u003ea mdo\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e). However, in fact there are far more localized regional identities, and many Tibetans have multiple regional identities as well - with the most local being the most pronounced. Each identity usually relates to a distinctive language, history, geographical territory, and often many more cultural traits such as architecture, clothing, and other factors.\u003c/p\u003e \u003ch1\u003eHistory\u003c/h1\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe origins of Tibet as a place and a people date back to the early seventh century when a local king named \u003cspan class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\"\u003eSongtsen Gampo\u003c/span\u003e (\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\"\u003esrong btsan sgam po\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e) led an astonishingly military expansion to create a major empire that controlled the vast plateau to the north of the Himalayan Mountain range.\u0026nbsp; The Tibetan Empire continued as one of Asia's major political and military powers right into the middle of the ninth century, after which it rapidly disintegrated. During the imperial period of Tibetan history, Tibet as a people emerged gradually with the creation of a common literary language, the establishment of a network of linked spoken languages, the importation of Buddhism as a common religious and cultural vehicle, and the creation of a shared history and sense of identity.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAfter a century of chaos and political decentralization, by the end of the tenth century a renaissance of Tibetan culture and religion had begun. This came to be called the \"later dissemination\" of religion, with the imperial period retroactively understood as the \"earlier dissemination\". The great translation project of classical Buddhist literature from India took place in both periods, such that by the fourteenth century the Buddhist canon and major sects had taken form - the \u003cspan class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\"\u003eB\u0026ouml;n\u003c/span\u003e (\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\"\u003ebon\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e), \u003cspan class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\"\u003eNyingma\u003c/span\u003e (\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\"\u003ernying ma\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e), \u003cspan class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\"\u003eKagy\u0026uuml;\u003c/span\u003e (\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\"\u003ebka' brgyud\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e), \u003cspan class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\"\u003eSakya\u003c/span\u003e (\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\"\u003esa skya\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e), and \u003cspan class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\"\u003eGeluk\u003c/span\u003e (\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\"\u003edge lugs\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e).\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTibet was never again to achieve the political centralization of the imperial period after the ninth century, and the plateau was dominated by a lengthy series of polities, large and small, right into the twentieth century.

The Chinese cultural revolution in particular caused huge devestation and suffering in Tibet from the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s, while the 1980s were the site of a remarkable renaissance of Tibetan\u0026nbsp; culture\u0026nbsp; across the plateau. Religious institutions were rebuilt, a large publishing industry for old and new Tibetan writings was established, and Tibetans reestablished traditional practices.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSince the late 1980s, Tibet has been marked by rapid transformation in terms of infrastructure development, Chinese immigration, and recurrent periods of social unrest in response to government oscillation between relative liberalization and martial law in its policies toward Tibetans.

That strong sense of unity thus exists hand-in-hand with an exceptionally strong sense of regional and local identity, and the cultural diversity found amongst these communities is every bit as striking and remarkable as the environmental diversity of the plateau, which ranges from high altitude grasslands to almost sub-tropical jungle.\u003c/p\u003e \u003ch1\u003eCultural Diversity in Tibet \u0026amp; the Problem of Names\u003c/h1\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe English word \"Tibet\", and the corresponding ancient Tibetan word \"\u003cspan class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\"\u003eb\u0026ouml;\u003c/span\u003e\" (\u003cspan class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\"\u003e\u003cem\u003ebod\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/span\u003e), are well-known rubrics with complex patterns of historical use. This short discussion is quite inadequate, but attempts to offer at least a starting point for thinking about a difficult and contentious issue that demands extensive research, discussion, and debate. In addition, it is not merely a scholarly issue, but also one with political implications and can thus easily provoke\u0026nbsp; emotional responses. Non-Tibetans, as well as some contemporary Tibetans (especially those from the diaspora), often now assume that \"Tibet\" and \"Tibetan\" reflect an unproblematic means of referring to a unitary people in the Tibetan language as grounded in the words \"\u003cspan class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\"\u003eb\u0026ouml;\u003c/span\u003e\" and \"\u003cspan class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\"\u003eb\u0026ouml;pa\u003c/span\u003e\" (\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\"\u003ebod pa\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e). Unfortunately, this is not the case. My interest is in examining the adequacy or inadequacy of Tibetan-language terms that have expressed in historical times, and/or in contemporary times, the strong sense of people living on the \u003cspan class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\"\u003eTibetan plateau\u003c/span\u003e, and in some areas immediately south of it, that they belong to a common people with shared past, destiny, origin narratives, language (or language family), literary language, values, and practices, despite the extreme diversity that divides them and can also localize their identity to a single village or valley. In one way or another, and to varying degrees, this has been true ever since the early seventh century founding of the Tibetan Empire.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThis broad cultural region, regardless of its political fate or divisions in any given century, for better or worse is usually\u0026nbsp; labeled\u0026nbsp; as \"Tibet\" or \"\u003cspan class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\"\u003eb\u0026ouml;\u003c/span\u003e\". The difficulties of this name begin with the fact that \"Tibet\" in English is not used in the same ways that its Tibetan equivalent, \u003cspan class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\"\u003eb\u0026ouml;\u003c/span\u003e, is used - and yet we typically assume that they are completely equivalent.\u0026nbsp; In addition, regardless of language, we tend to use the term in shifting ways without full acknowledgment of the changing terms of reference.\u0026nbsp; Firstly, there is a confusion between political and cultural references, a frequent problem when people assume that the clarity of modern nation state divisions applies to the complexities of political and cultural divisions prior to the twenty-first century. Secondly,\u0026nbsp; within Tibetan communities, the words \"\u003cspan class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\"\u003eb\u0026ouml;\u003c/span\u003e\", \"\u003cspan class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\"\u003eb\u0026ouml;pa\u003c/span\u003e\", and various permutations are used with various degrees of narrowness and breadth of scope depending on the context. In English, at least, this problem has often been addressed by attempts to add a qualifier to the term, leading to the expression \"Cultural Tibet\" or \"Greater Tibet\", the latter of which is also well known to many contemporary Tibetans as \"\u003cspan class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\"\u003eb\u0026ouml; chenpo\u003c/span\u003e\" (\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\"\u003ebod chen po\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e). In addition, there are such terms as the \"Tibetan people\" (\u003cspan class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\"\u003eb\u0026ouml; mi\u003c/span\u003e, \u003cem\u003e\u003cspan class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\"\u003ebod mi\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e), or \"Tibetan subjects\" (\u003cspan class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\"\u003eb\u0026ouml; bangmi\u003c/span\u003e, \u003cem\u003e\u003cspan class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\"\u003ebod 'bangs mi\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e), which can in some contexts be attempts to produce a rubric which anyone who feels they belong to that felt sense of cultural communality might embrace.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn terms of confusion between the political and the cultural, the Tibetan people as a communal or cultural identity originated in the seventh century with the political rise of the Tibetan empire. The Empire began in Central Tibet, south of \u003cspan class=\"place\" title=\"F637\"\u003eLhasa\u003c/span\u003e (\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan class=\"place\" title=\"F637\"\u003elha sa\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e), but rapidly expanded all across the plateau to become one of the great empires of the world at the time.\u0026nbsp; It then gradually disintegrated in the ninth century, leaving behind a huge region of people with a common language family, literary language, and sense of unified practices, descent, and destiny, though their original imperial political unity was never again to be recaptured.\u0026nbsp; The \"\u003cspan class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\"\u003eGanden Palace\u003c/span\u003e\" (\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\"\u003edga' ldan pho brang\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e) polity nominally led by the Dalai Lama emanations from the seventeenth century onwards was the most successful and extensive attempt to establish a broad political unity, but even it was far smaller than the extent of culturally Tibetan regions that was the persisting legacy of those ancient imperial achievements. In contemporary times, Tibetan communities\u0026nbsp; - not even considering the new disapora that has so remarkably established itself around the world since the 1950s - can be found in significant numbers not simply in China, which has incorporated the vast majority of contemporary Tibet since 1959, but also in northern Nepal, eastern Pakistan, and parts of Northern India. In addition, Bhutan, which has successfully emerged as a vibrant modern nation state of its own, is also part of a historical continuity with the Tibetan plateau, though it has successfully transited into its own autonomous national and hence cultural identity, much as European peoples long ago emerged with distinctive unified political and cultural identities.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn terms of confusion about internal cultural regions within the broader area of Cultural Tibet, Tibetans have very strong regional identities that go hand in hand with their unique local languages, architecture, clothing, histories, and many other traditions. A simple way that Tibetans talk about their internal cultural regions is to refer to three great regions - \u003cspan class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\"\u003eUtsang\u003c/span\u003e (\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\"\u003edbus gtsang\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e) in the West, \u003cspan class=\"place\" title=\"F5225\"\u003eKham\u003c/span\u003e (\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan class=\"place\" title=\"F5225\"\u003ekhams\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e) in the East, and \u003cspan class=\"place\" title=\"F15348\"\u003eAmdo\u003c/span\u003e (\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan class=\"place\" title=\"F15348\"\u003ea mdo\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e) in the Northeast - though in fact the situation is far more complex than that.\u0026nbsp; Yet even in those larger regions, putting aside the issue of the artificial nature of these categories, people are far more likely to refer to themselves in terms of that local identity over their general Tibetaness in conversation - thus residents of \u003cspan class=\"place\" title=\"F5225\"\u003eKham\u003c/span\u003e will now refer to themselves as \"\u003cspan class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\"\u003ekhampa\u003c/span\u003e\" (\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\"\u003ekhams pa\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e) rather\u0026nbsp; than \"\u003cspan class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\"\u003eb\u0026ouml;pa\u003c/span\u003e\", while residents of \u003cspan class=\"place\" title=\"F15348\"\u003eAmdo\u003c/span\u003e refer to themselves as \"\u003cspan class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\"\u003eAmdowa\u003c/span\u003e\" (\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\"\u003ea mdo ba\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e). \u0026nbsp; \u003cspan class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\"\u003eB\u0026ouml;pa\u003c/span\u003e,\u0026nbsp; or \"Tibetan\" (though the switch from Tibetan to English is far from unproblematic here, since English speaking Tibetans would not use the word \"Tibetan\" at all as other Tibetans might use the word \u003cspan class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\"\u003eb\u0026ouml;pa\u003c/span\u003e) is a term then used in turn more generally to signify Tibetans to their west, namely in \u0026Uuml;tsang. Despite this, in a context in which the comparison is with themselves to other ethnic groups, they may very well use the term \u003cspan class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\"\u003eb\u0026ouml;pa\u003c/span\u003e to refer to themselves in a more embracing manner, or might use another form of the word, such as \u003cspan class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\"\u003eb\u0026ouml;mi\u003c/span\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIt also is essential to not disregard the literary context, and the many ways in which literary texts from across the plateau written in literary Tibetan refer to the common identity of the peoples and communities living throughout these regions. We need to examine the profuse ways that Tibetan literature evokes and labels this felt communality, and the much less problematic use of such terms as \"\u003cspan class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\"\u003eb\u0026ouml;\u003c/span\u003e\" or \"\u003cspan class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\"\u003eb\u0026ouml;mi\u003c/span\u003e\" therein to refer to peoples and communities across the plateau, regardless of other cultural divisions.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIt should also be noted that China divides the Tibetan communities that it administers into five administrative regions, or provinces: \u003cspan class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\"\u003eTibet Autonomous Region\u003c/span\u003e (TAR), \u003cspan class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\"\u003eQinghai\u003c/span\u003e, \u003cspan class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\"\u003eSichuan\u003c/span\u003e, \u003cspan class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\"\u003eGansu\u003c/span\u003e and \u003cspan class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\"\u003eYunnan\u003c/span\u003e.\u0026nbsp; As such, Tibetans from other regions will generally refer to the TAR as \"\u003cspan class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\"\u003eb\u0026ouml;\u003c/span\u003e\", although within the TAR, one will often find Tibetans referring to Tibetans in \u003cspan class=\"place\" title=\"F637\"\u003eLhasa\u003c/span\u003e or the surrounding regions as \"\u003cspan class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\"\u003eb\u0026ouml;pa\u003c/span\u003e\" in contrast to themselves, based upon cultural perceptions. The complexity of usage of these terms is thus endless. That said, this complexity should in no way be understood as indicating that Tibetans lack a strong sense of unity across the plateau, but rather they point to the exceptional internal cultural diversity of Tibet, and the equally exceptional strong regional sense of identity. This pattern can go right down to individual valleys or even villages, where the same pattern of the oscillating use of terms for self-identification is often repeated not for \u003cspan class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\"\u003eb\u0026ouml;pa\u003c/span\u003e, but for the regional rubrics in contrast to much more local terms of identity. While this might be seen as the fault lines of weakness in Tibetan culture, it also points to strength for those who believe cultural diversity and healthy local traditions are a better source of a more profound and vital unity than homogeneity.\u003c/p\u003e \u003ch1\u003eCaveat\u003c/h1\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe preceding comments are offered as provisional thoughts, not for citation.
