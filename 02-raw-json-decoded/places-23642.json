Dolpa) District</h2> <h3 id=\"b7-2-12\">(231) sMan ri Monastery in Dolanji</h3> <h4 id=\"b7-2-12-1\">1. Name </h4> <p>dPal gshen bstan sMan ri&rsquo;i gling</p> <h4 id=\"b7-2-12-2\">2. Location</h4> <p>The monastery is located in Dolanji. It can be reached from the town called Solan in Himachal Pradesh. From Solan one can take either a bus or a taxi to go to the monastery. The route passes through a small village called Ochgat and Dolanji is a few kilometers away to the south of this village. In Dolanji the monastery is situated on a hill above a Tibetan refugee settlement called Thob rgyal gsar pa.</p> <h4 id=\"b7-2-12-3\">3. History</h4> <p>In 1968, Shes rab bstan pa&rsquo;i rgyal mtshan (1912-1962), the abbot of gYung drung gling Monastery (No.2) performed a ceremony in order to find a successor of Shes rab blo gros (1935-1962), the 32nd abbot of sMan ri Monastery (No.1). Sangs rgyas bstan &rsquo;dzin (b.1929) was elected by secret lot as the 33rd abbot of sMan ri. He was elected without knowing while he was doing research in the University of Oslo. He therefore soon returned to India. His name was then changed to Lung rtogs bstan pa&rsquo;i nyi ma when he was enthroned as the abbot as the tradition requires. In 1969, he began to have an assembly hall built. Since then he devoted all his time to the monastic establishment. Over the years, the monastery developed enormously. In this he was supported by dPon slob Sangs rgyas bstan &rsquo;dzin (1912-1978), the senior teacher of sMan ri Monastery in Tibet and dPon slob bsTan &rsquo;dzin rnam dag (b.1926), the junior teacher of the same monastery. The latter then became the senior teacher in the monastery at Dolanji while dGe bshes gYung drung rnam rgyal was appointed as the junior teacher when the studies of philosophy and logic were established. Later dPon slob bsTan &rsquo;dzin rnam dag was succeeded by dPon slob &rsquo;Phrin las nyi ma as the senior teacher. </p> <p>The monastery consists of an assembly hall (&rsquo;du khang), the abbot&rsquo;s residence (bla brang), the library (dpe mdzod), residences of the monks, buildings with rooms for lectures and conferences. There is a dispensary, a house for the orphans that the monastery keeps as well as cells for meditation retreats, a guest house and a building for computer work. There is also an institute called Mu khri btsad po&rsquo;i zhang bod rig gzhung zhib &rsquo;jug khang. The monastery publishes annually a periodical called Bon sgo. </p> <h4 id=\"b7-2-12-4\">4. Hierarchical system</h4> <ul xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" class=\"bullet-blue\"> <li>khri &rsquo;dzin</li> <li>yongs &rsquo;dzin</li> <li>dpon slob</li> <li>dbu mdzad </li> <li>dge skos</li> <li>spyi gnyer</li> <li>gnyer pa</li> </ul> <h4 id=\"b7-2-12-5\">5. Number of monks</h4> <p>The monastery has about 250 monks mainly coming from Dolpo and other areas in Nepal; from Khams, Amdo, Nag chu kha regions, Central Tibet as well as mNga&rsquo; ris, Western Tibet.</p> <p>There are also European and American monks who follow the courses of meditation as well as study. Scholars from various countries come and stay in the monastery for doing research. </p> <h4 id=\"b7-2-12-6\">6. Current education</h4> <p>In 1978 courses in various traditional learning were established. They are concerned with such sujects as the classic texts on philosophy and logic particularly by mNyam med Shes rab rgyal mtshan and other masters. They also read Tantras and rDzogs chen texts as well as taking up studies in poetry, astrology, Sanskrit, traditional medicine, metrology connected with making stupas and mandalas as well as the thangka painting. After 8 years of study students can sit for examination mainly by debate and finally obtain the dge bshes degree. From 1986 to 2002 about 57 students obtained the dge bshes degree.</p> <h4 id=\"b7-2-12-7\">7. Educational exchange</h4> <p>Students are often sent to other religious schools, especially Triten Norbutse (No.230) and the dGe lugs pa colleges in India on short periods. After obtaining the dge bshes degree, the majority is either encouraged or voluntarily leave the monastery. These monks go back to their own countries, such as Dolpo in Nepal and Tibet where they try to re-establish either the monastic tradition or just help revive cultural traditions that were lost or discouraged. Some of these monks also go to Western countries where they establish Bonpo centres of learning and meditation practice.</p> <h4 id=\"b7-2-12-8\">8 / 9.
