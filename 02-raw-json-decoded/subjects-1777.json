Thus the following sentence may have two meanings:</p> <ul> <li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">སློབ་གྲྭ་ལ་དེབ་འདུག</span> &ldquo;There are books at the school.&rdquo; Or, &ldquo;The school has books.&rdquo; </li> </ul> <p class=\"Paragraph\"><em>Note</em>: Be careful not to confuse this construction with the genitive:</p> <p><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">སློབ་གྲྭའི་དེབ་འདུག</span> &ldquo;There are (some of) the school&rsquo;s books.&rdquo;</p>","created_at":"2013-09-15 04:07:34 UTC","updated_at":"2013-09-15 04:07:34 UTC","id":348,"title":null,"is_primary":true}]}
