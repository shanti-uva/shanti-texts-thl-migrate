The terrain is gently inclined and strewn with small rocks and gravel. From the site there is a very long vista to the east and sweeping views to the north has well. The south and west directions, however, are constrained by the proximate ridge system. The site consists of a single pillar erected inside an enclosure. </p> <h4 id=\"b2-1-27-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>According to local sources in the village of <span class=\"popular\">Lhaktongpa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Lhag mthong pa</span>, <span class=\"popular\">B&uuml;ltang Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bul thang rdo ring</span> appeared with the rise of existence. </p> <h4 id=\"b2-1-27-4\">Site elements</h4> <h5 id=\"b2-1-27-4-1\">Enclosure</h5> <p>The double-course enclosure is roughly aligned in the cardinal directions. It measures 11 m (east to west) x 12.5 m (east wall) and 14.5 m (west wall). This enclosure is unusual for having longer dimensions north-south han east-west. The walls of the perimeter (around 50 cm thick) contain uncut slabs and some blockwork (20 cm to 85 cm long) inserted into the ground edgewise. A few of the slabs are as little as 2 cm in thickness. The stones of the walls protrude as much as 25 cm above ground level. Little of the enclosing walls have survived. There is a 3.3 m long south wall segment intact near the east corner of the enclosure and the west half of the north wall is largely in place. The mostly intact east wall had one or possibly even three openings, which were not evenly spaced. The most recognizable &lsquo;portal&rsquo; has a 50 cm long stone running perpendicular to the wall course making up one side of it and two stones (combined length 55 cm) on the other side. The gap this formed is 30 cm in width. </p> <h5 id=\"b2-1-27-4-2\">Pillar</h5> <p>The lone in situ pillar (1.2 m [height] x 95 cm [basal girth]) was erected near what was the inner edge of the west wall of the enclosure (this wall has been obliterated). This stele of four irregular sides has a grayish to purplish hue. Also near the west end of the enclosure there are two smaller broken pillars. One specimen is snapped off at ground level while the other one still retains 30 cm of its height. </p> <h4 id=\"b2-1-27-5\">Affiliated sites</h4> <p>In the environs of the small permanent settlement of <span class=\"popular\">Lhaktongpa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Lhag mthong pa</span> (32&deg; 23.689&#900; N. lat. / 83&deg; 36.688&#900; / 4420 m) there used to be a small ancient pillar.
