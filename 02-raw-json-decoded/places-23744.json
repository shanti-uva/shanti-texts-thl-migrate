One of the primary routes between China and Tibet passes through Litang and for this reason it has long been the focus of regional powers.

In the seventeenth century the Fifth Dalai Lama passed through the region and established several large Geluk (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">dge lugs</span></em>) monasteries. Later the Seventh Dalai Lama was born in Litang. In 1728 the leader of Litang, called the Governor of Litang(<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">li thang sde pa</span></em>) or the Governor of Litang Tongra (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">li thang stong ra sde pa</span></em>), was made a headman (土司 <em><span class=\"chinese\" title=\"Type ID here\">tusi</span></em>) and incorporated into the Qing Dynasty.
