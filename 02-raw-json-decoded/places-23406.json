Name</h3> <p>Dar sding (also lding) Ri rgyal dgon; its formal name is Khri brtan nor bu rtse.</p> <h3 id=\"b4-3-2\">2. Location </h3> <p>A six-hour drive from Shigatse brings one to the seat of bZhad mthong smon rdzong. From here it takes two hours to reach the monastery on foot. One can also go there by bus.</p> <h3 id=\"b4-3-3\">3. History </h3> <p>Initially, there was only a small temple of the gShen family. In 1360 dMu gshen Nyi ma rgyal mtshan, the fifteenth successor in the gShen lineage, not only expanded the temple but also built the assembly hall and renamed Ri rgyal Khri brtan nor bu rtse. It is situated on Mount Ri rgyal behind the village called Dar sding. The seat of the gShen family is in Dar sding village, where the temple known as gSer sgo khra mo was built in 1173 by Kun mkhyen Ye shes blo gros, who was the ninth successor after gShen chen Klu dga&rsquo; (996-1035). In the village there was the famous stupa called sKu &rsquo;bum rig byed khang. From the beginning of the 15th century, the monastery became renown for its statues, scriptures and stupas of the Bon religion. In 1966, during the Cultural Revolution, the monastery on the mountain, the temple gSer sgo khra mo and the great stupa were all completely destroyed. In 1982 the monks began to rebuild the monastery. Led by Nor bu dbang rgyal, they first restored gSer sgo khra mo in the village, then rebuilt Khri brtan nor bu rtse. It is said that there have been twenty-five abbots from Kun mkhyen Ye shes blo gros to the present Nor bu dbang rgyal.</p> <h3 id=\"b4-3-4\">4. Headship </h3> <p>Leadership was ensured by a system of abbotship, with the abbots coming mostly from the gShen family.</p> <h3 id=\"b4-3-5\">5. Current number of monks</h3> <p>Twenty monks</p> <h3 id=\"b4-3-6\">6. Current education</h3> <p>As the monastery has not organized any study classes for the monks, they have to look for private tutors for their studies.</p> <h3 id=\"b4-3-7\">7. Educational exchange</h3> <p>So far, this work has not yet begun.</p> <h3 id=\"b4-3-8\">8. Daily rituals</h3> <p>Religious services dedicated to the tutelary and protective deities are performed everyday.</p> <h3 id=\"b4-3-9\">9.
