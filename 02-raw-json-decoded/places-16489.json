The largest summit structure has been reduced to a lump of earth capping an adobe foundation/revetment. The use of earthen walls in this structure must be a response to the relative scarcity of stones at the site and the presence of ample deposits of clay. In the vicinity, on higher pinnacles, small bits of masonry are found. To the south are two major groups of caves, many with the remains of masonry fa\u0026ccedil;ades built around them.

This building carcass has a maximum height of 2.5 m (east side). South and east of this structure, on or near the ridge-top, here are the faint traces of many other structures. From the main earthen structure, a ridge-line stretches in a southerly direction for 100 m. No structural remains are visible on this summit but they may well have been obliterated by erosion and the failure of the soft slopes. Beyond this area, the main ridgeline turns in an easterly direction and gains in elevation. All along this 150 m long, 3 m to 7 m wide summit, there are the fragmentary remains of revetments (standing walls have disappeared). It appears that a fairly dense agglomeration of small buildings once stood here. The earthen formation is subject to heavy erosion and it is probable that many walls slipped down the very steep slopes over time. \u003c/p\u003e \u003ch5 id=\"b1-1-9-4-2\"\u003eNorthwest cave complex\u003c/h5\u003e \u003cp\u003eBelow the summit ridge, on the north and west sides of the formation, there are around three dozen small caves. Many of them have oblong niches in the walls and a domed recess in the rear, common architectural features of \u003cspan class=\"popular\"\u003eGug\u0026eacute;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"scholar\"\u003eGu ge\u003c/span\u003e cave complexes. Many of the caves have fire-blackened ceilings, a reliable indicator of human habitation. Most of the caves also have ruined masonry fronts. These fa\u0026ccedil;ades were constructed with small (40 cm or less in length) blocks of a local yellowish sedimentary stone, slabs of a brown stone or with cobbles. Much of the mud-mortar in the joints has washed away, giving the walls a dry-mortar appearance. In certain places there is evidence that mud plaster was used to cover he fa\u0026ccedil;ades. There is no evidence, however, that any of these highly worn walls were ochre tinted, as is found at the caves of \u003cspan class=\"popular\"\u003eY\u0026uuml;lm\u0026eacute;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"scholar\"\u003eYul smad\u003c/span\u003e, which were used by Buddhist practitioners. \u003c/p\u003e \u003ch5 id=\"b1-1-9-4-3\"\u003eSoutheast cave complex\u003c/h5\u003e \u003cp\u003eNear where the north-south oriented ridgeline of Blue Castle turns in an east-west direction, anterooms (12 m x 7 m) with walls up to 2 m in height enclose three caves. In one of these outer walls there is a window opening 20 cm in height. One 2-m section of an outer wall was presumably made of adobe blocks, but it has eroded so heavily that it is now only 15 cm thick. One of the enclosed caves has a deep square recess cut into a central chamber. Another cave has a small platform in the rear. On the south and east sides of the formation, 10 m to 15 m below the summit, there is a group of around two dozen more shallow caves. Stretching over a distance of 100 m, a significant proportion of these caves have disintegrated fa\u0026ccedil;ades as well as the remains of around one dozen anterooms. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eDirectly below the 2-m-tall walls enclosing three caves of the southeast cave complex, there is a cave with a domed recess flanked by two oblong niches. At a nearby location there are extensive anterooms bounding three other caves. The walls of these anterooms are up to 3 m in height, as is a wall shoring up the formation. These are the tallest manmade structures extant at Blue Castle. The three caves behind the anterooms have the remnants of mud plastered stone-walls built around their mouths. In one cave there is a large domed bay in the rear flanked by an oblong niche on one side and stone shelving on he other. A hearth in this cave appears to have been used fairly recently. The adjacent cave has a long, low, shallow recess in the rear. The third cave has three chambers. Farther east, at the eastern extremity of Blue Castle, are several more caves and small wall fragments. \u003c/p\u003e \u003ch4 id=\"b1-1-9-5\"\u003eAffiliated sites\u003c/h4\u003e \u003cp\u003eThere are several Buddhist archaeological sites in the vicinity of Blue Castle.\u003c/p\u003e \u003ch5 id=\"b1-1-9-5-1\"\u003emChod rten\u003c/h5\u003e \u003cp\u003eA number of Buddhist ruins are found on the south flanks of the hillside below Blue Castle. These include a hilltop a type of shrine and several proximate stone and adobe walls situated to the west of he ancient fortress.

Attaining a maximum height of 6 m, this structure represents a prominent landmark. Its ground plan consists of a large central room surrounded on all sides by a 1.5-m wide passageway. The entrance to the building was in the east. According to local elders, this was a Buddhist temple built before the Horned Eagle Valley Silver Castle monastery, located on the opposite bank of the Sutlej, in \u003cspan class=\"popular\"\u003eY\u0026uuml;lm\u0026eacute;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"scholar\"\u003eYul smad\u003c/span\u003e.

Between the Blue Castle fortress and Blue Castle monastery there are two small outcrops, each with two or three caves. On he summits of both these outcrops are the remains of masonry footings, the largest group of which measures 8.8 m x 3.8 m. It appears that buildings once stood here. Below the largest foundation is a cave with windows cut into the formation. Below the other outcrop upon which a foundation sits there is a cave with the traces of a masonry front and what appear to be the fragmentary footings of an anteroom. \u003c/p\u003e \u003ch5 id=\"b1-1-9-5-3\"\u003eJo mo \u003cspan class=\"popular emph\"\u003elhakang\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"scholar emph\"\u003elha khang\u003c/span\u003e \u003c/h5\u003e \u003cp\u003eThis Buddhist cave shrine is located in \u003cspan class=\"popular\"\u003eY\u0026uuml;lt\u0026ouml;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"scholar\"\u003eYul stod\u003c/span\u003e and contains frescos painted circa the 13th or 14th century CE.

Fortunately, the excellent artwork escaped the worst excesses of the Chinese Cultural Revolution, and around 75 % of all but the anterior wall paintings are intact.
