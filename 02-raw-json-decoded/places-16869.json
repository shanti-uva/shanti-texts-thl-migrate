This building measured no less than 6.3 m (northeast-southwest) x 3.1 m (southeast-northwest). It probably contained two chambers, at least one of which is L-shaped. The edifice has a coursed-rubble fabric and he thick seams contain copious amounts of a clay- or mud-based mortar. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe forward/southeast wall is 3 m to 4 m in height. Due to the ravages of time, the forward wall now has a V-shaped gap in the middle of it. The southwest half of the forward wall was generally built with larger stones han the northeast half. The construction and presentation of the forward wall suggests that is was not too much aller originally than its current height. About 1 m up from the base of the northeast half of the forward wall here are herringbone courses of masonry. Stones and earth are heaped up below the herringbone stonework. This is a distinctive stone working technique found in larger temple-tomb edifices appended to arrays of pillars as well as in some castles. For instance, \u003cspan class=\"popular\"\u003eRala Kharmar\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"scholar\"\u003eRa la mkhar dmar\u003c/span\u003e (see A-65) founded by the first Buddhist king of \u003cspan class=\"popular\"\u003eT\u0026ouml;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"scholar\"\u003eStod\u003c/span\u003e, \u003cspan class=\"popular\"\u003eNyma G\u0026ouml;n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"scholar\"\u003eNyi ma mgon\u003c/span\u003e (probably in the early tenth century CE) exhibits herringbone stonework.

Here we have an example of a specific stone working technique that was carried from the protohistoric period all the way down to the dawn of the great Buddhist resurgence in western Tibet. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe southwest wall is 4 m high. At the base of this wall there are either the remains of a small structural extension or a buttress. In the middle of the southwest wall there is a cavity (80 cm x 50 cm x 70 cm [deep]). This cavity came about through damage to what may have been a purposely built recess in the structure. The cavity reveals three tamarisk beams (10 cm to 15 cm diameter), which are an integral part of the construction of he southwest wall. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe southwest half of the temple-tomb is dominated by a narrow (70 cm to 80 cm wide) L-shaped chamber (each of its two sides is about 2 m long). This chamber is liable to have had both burial and funerary ritual functions. Most portions of the outer walls surrounding this chamber are 40 cm to 60 thick. The portion of the forward/southeast wall bounding the inner side of the \u0026lsquo;L\u0026rsquo;, however, is 1.8 m thick. This much thicker wall section significantly adds to the structural integrity of the chamber. There is an opening (20 cm x 25 cm) near he top of the southeast end of the southwest wall of the chamber. This opening is supported by a brown sandstone lintel, 35 cm in length. There is also an opening (20 cm x 25 cm) in the upper southeast wall of the chamber, which has a sandstone lintel, 25 cm in length. The deliberate inclusion of apertures in the L-shaped chamber, may suggest that it had habitational functions, perhaps related to the conduct of mortuary rites. These openings may also have played a role in the desiccation of the interred remains by providing ventilation to the chamber. The walls surrounding the chamber are up to 2.2 m in height. This demonstrates that the floor of the chamber was elevated as much as 1.8 m above ground level. The elevation of the chamber may possibly be related o eschatological beliefs, concerning the celestial realm, that were held by the builders. Elevated burial chambers are, of course, also characteristic of the mountaintop cubic tombs (II.3) and temple-tombs appended to arrays of pillars (II.2c). The narrow nature of the chamber, the massive forward wall buttress and comparative architectonic data from other archaic monuments, indicates that \u003cspan class=\"popular\"\u003eKhyinak Rong\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"scholar\"\u003eKhyi nag rong\u003c/span\u003e may have had an all-stone corbelled roof. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOn the exterior face of the northwest wall there are still traces of clay plaster, illustrating that \u003cspan class=\"popular\"\u003eKhyinak Rong\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"scholar\"\u003eKhyi nag rong\u003c/span\u003e was not left with raw stone walls. We might even consider that this plaster was painted and decorated with mineral pigments, as are some archaic horizon shrines found in sheltered locations and nearly all lamaist facilities of the historic epoch. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSave for the forward wall, the northeast half of the temple-tomb has been reduced to heaps of earth and stone rubble. It probably featured an L-shaped or some other type of chamber. Temple-tombs and other archaic funerary monuments of Upper Tibet usually exhibit symmetrical design features. Nevertheless, the difference in the southwest and northwest halves of the forward wall of the edifice may suggest that the chambers were of different designs. \u003c/p\u003e \u003ch5 id=\"b2-4-2-4-2\"\u003eTho\u003c/h5\u003e \u003cp\u003eTo the northwest of the edifice there is a series of small quadrate masonry structures, which are mostly grouped in two rows. These two rows are oriented southeast-northwest, having the same alignment as the two shorter walls of the temple-tomb. These superficial structures, 19 in number, consist of a layer of stones laid flat on the ground. There are two main types among them: enclosures made up of a single line of stones with open interiors, and stones tightly knit across the breadth and length of the structure. It is possible that they had minimal superstructures made up of several vertical courses of masonry, but there is no extant structural evidence of this feature. The area around the quadrate structures is covered in loose stones, which probably originated from the quadrate structures themselves. The morphological traits of the quadrate structures, their organization in rows and their presence at a funerary site, recalls the \u003cspan class=\"popular emph\"\u003eto\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"scholar emph\"\u003etho\u003c/span\u003e of he Bon tradition.

This array of upright slabs begins 2.3 m southeast of S8. The slab-wall fragments are oriented southeast-northwest and are spaced around 20 cm apart.

The three outlying walls (around 90 cm thick) are composed of stones laid flat. In some places along the perimeter there are small wall segments composed of two or three vertical courses of stones. These wall segments are around 30 cm in height, indicating that the enclosure was a substantial structure.
