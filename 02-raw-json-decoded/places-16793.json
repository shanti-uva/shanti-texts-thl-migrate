The east-facing slopes are generally grassy and have a moderate slope gradient. The small terraced funerary structures (20 m&sup2; to 60 m&sup2;) of the site appear to have sub-rectangular and ovoid forms, while the large specimens (60 m&sup2; to 120 m&sup2;) are rectangular. These structures are built in the same fashion as other examples of the typology (II.2e) in the far eastern <span class=\"popular\">Jangtang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Byang thang</span>. The forward/downhill sides of the structures are prominently elevated above the slope, while rear walls are generally flush with the slope. The two long walls of these flat-topped structures are oriented perpendicular to the axis of the slope. Stones without any discernable pattern or arrangement line the forward flank and sides of each structure. In some specimens there are also clearly delineated rear walls. Most, if not all of the terraced structures of<span class=\"popular\">Mig&ouml;n Ch&ouml;nyi</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mi mgon chos nyid</span>, are free from structural elements situated inside he outer walls. Variable-length (20 cm to 60 cm long) grayish volcanic (?) rocks were used in construction. </p> <h4 id=\"b2-2-41-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>According to villagers of <span class=\"popular\">Mig&ouml;n Ch&ouml;nyi</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mi mgon chos nyid</span>, the south sector of the site was a Buddhist nunnery and the north sector, a Buddhist monastery, both of which were destroyed by the jun gar Mongols (18th century CE). The <span class=\"popular\">Namru</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gnam ru</span> cultural luminary, <span class=\"popular\">Lozang Tenpa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Blo bzang bstan pa</span> (see fn. 188), is under the impression that <span class=\"popular\">Mig&ouml;n Ch&ouml;nyi</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mi mgon chos nyid</span> was an ancient Bon residential site destroyed by the jun gar.</p> <h4 id=\"b2-2-41-4\">Site elements</h4> <p> <span class=\"popular\">Mig&ouml;n Ch&ouml;nyi</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mi mgon chos nyid</span> is divided into south (14 funerary structures) and north (32 funerary structures) sectors, which are separated from one another by a gravelly slope, approximately 150 m in width. The south sector structures are primarily arrayed in a single row situated at the same elevation. The structures of the north sector are aggregated into several groups at varying elevations. Most of the larger structures are found in the north sector. The forward flanks of the large specimens are elevated as much as 1.5 m above the downhill slope, while the forward flanks of the smaller specimens are elevated up to a height of 1 m. The rear walls are flush with the uphill slope or slightly elevated above it in certain specimens. The largest specimen at <span class=\"popular\">Mig&ouml;n Ch&ouml;nyi</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mi mgon chos nyid</span> (13 m x 9.2 m) has a slight depression in the middle of its top. Perhaps this represents traces of an old excavation. In recent times, <span class=\"popular\">Mig&ouml;n Ch&ouml;nyi</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mi mgon chos nyid</span> does not appear to have been disturbed. </p> <table cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\" class=\"navarrows\"> <tbody> <tr> <td class=\"leftcell\"> <a class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-left.gif\" title=\"Previous Section\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"midcell\"> <a class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-up.gif\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"rightcell\"> <a class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-right.gif\" title=\"Next Section\"/> </a> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div id=\"chap-id\">/bellezza2/b2-2-41/</div> <div style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\" class=\"jqmWindow\" id=\"chapRefWindow\"> <div class=\"closebtn\"> <a href=\"#\">Close</a> </div> <div style=\"height: 280px;\" class=\"conx-content\"> <h3>Note Citation for Page <span class=\"pgnm\"/> </h3> <p class=\"biblref\">John Vincent Bellezza, Antiquities of Zhang Zhung: A Comprehensive Inventory of Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Monuments on he Tibetan Upland (Charlottesville, VA 22904:Tibetan &amp; Himalayan Library, 2010), <span class=\"pgnm\"/>. </p> <h3>Bibliographic Citation</h3> <p>John Vincent Bellezza.
