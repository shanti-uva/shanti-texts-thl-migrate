The five quadrate funerary superstructures of the site are distributed quite widely over the plain. They are built of uncut brown sandstone blocks. In addition to <span class=\"popular\">Mardep Nupma</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dmar ldebs nub ma</span>, there are funerary structures at <span class=\"popular\">Khorchen</span><span class=\"scholar\">&rsquo;Khor chen</span> and <span class=\"popular\">Riu Gyamchung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ri&rsquo;u gyam chung</span>. </p> <h4 id=\"b2-2-29-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>According to local <span class=\"popular emph\">drok pa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">&rsquo;brog pa</span>, <span class=\"popular\">Mardep Nupma</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dmar ldebs nub ma</span> and affiliated sites are tombs of the ancient <span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span>.</p> <h4 id=\"b2-2-29-4\">Site elements</h4> <h5 id=\"b2-2-29-4-1\">Funerary Structure FS1</h5> <p>Funerary structure FS1 (9 m x 9.4 m) consists of a square enclosure that is not well aligned in the cardinal directions (32&deg; 31.527&#900; N. lat. / 82&deg; 56.928&#900; E. long. / 4540 m). The entire structure is slightly raised above he surrounding plain. Three of its walls are single-course while the west wall is double-course (1 m thick). The variable-length (primarily 30 cm to 60 cm long) stones were laid flat on the ground. There are small wall races within the perimeter wall, suggesting that this was an intricately designed superstructure.</p> <h5 id=\"b2-2-29-4-2\">Funerary Structure FS2</h5> <p>Funerary structure FS2 (4.7 m x 5.8 m) is situated 13 m north of FS1. FS2 has been reduced to a highly fragmentary enclosure.</p> <h5 id=\"b2-2-29-4-3\">Funerary Structure FS3</h5> <p>Funerary structure FS3 (3.4 m x 4.3 m) is situated 75 m west of FS2. The walls of this rectangular enclosure are aligned in the cardinal directions. The walls are composed of variable length stones (primarily 40 cm to 60 cm long), which project a maximum of 20 cm above ground level. Part of the north wall of the enclosure is double-course. Other walls of the enclosure appear to be of the single-course variety. </p> <h5 id=\"b2-2-29-4-4\">Funerary Structure FS4</h5> <p>Funerary structure FS4 (4.8 m x 4.8 m) is situated 70 m west of FS3. Very little remains of this structure. There may be other specimens in the vicinity, but too little remains in place to know for certain.</p> <h5 id=\"b2-2-29-4-5\">Funerary Structure FS5</h5> <p>Funerary structure FS5 (6.7 m x 6.7 m) is situated roughly 1 km southwest of the other enclosures (32&deg; 31.241&#900; N. lat. / 82&deg; 56.283&#900; E. long. / 4520 m). The fragmentary walls of FS5 seem to be aligned in the cardinal directions. The stones of the walls appear to have been laid flat on the ground. </p> <h4 id=\"b2-2-29-5\">Affiliated sites</h4> <h5 id=\"b2-2-29-5-1\">&rsquo;Khor chen</h5> <p>On the south edge of the same plain that hosts the funerary structures of <span class=\"popular\">Mardep Nupma</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dmar ldebs nub ma</span> there are two more specimens at a place known as <span class=\"popular\">Khorchen</span><span class=\"scholar\">&rsquo;Khor chen</span> (32&deg; 29.889&#900; N. lat. / 82&deg; 54.113&#900; E. long. / 4450 m). These poorly preserved quadrate enclosures appear to have single-course walls, and measure 7.3 m x 6.4 m and 4.7 m x 5 m. The structures are built of a purplish stone, primarily 20 cm to 60 cm in length. What appears to be another funerary superstructure at <span class=\"popular\">Khorchen</span><span class=\"scholar\">&rsquo;Khor chen</span> is located some distance away (29.829&#900; / 53.940&#900; / 4450 m). In the south wall of this last enclosure there is a single line of in situ stones aligned east-west. </p> <h5 id=\"b2-2-29-5-2\">Ri&rsquo;u gyam chung</h5> <p>What may be another funerary structure was detected further west at a locale called <span class=\"popular\">Riu Gyamchung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ri&rsquo;u gyam chung</span> (32&deg; 29.965&#900; N. lat. / 82&deg; 52.906&#900; E. long. / 4450 m). This square structure is situated on the edge of high ground overlooking the large plain to the east. The site has wide open views in all directions. The structure (2.7 m x 2.9 m) is aligned in he cardinal directions, and is primarily made of smaller purplish stones (10 cm to 40 cm long). Within the partly intact, outer foundation walls there is a pile of rubble 1 m in height. Many other stones are scattered around the vicinity. The design of the wall traces and the amount of stones strewn around the site indicates hat the <span class=\"popular\">Riu Gyamchung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ri&rsquo;u gyam chung</span> monument was constructed with an elaborate superstructure of significant elevation. Rather than a funerary function, it is possible that this structure had alternative ritual functions. </p> <table cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\" class=\"navarrows\"> <tbody> <tr> <td class=\"leftcell\"> <a class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-left.gif\" title=\"Previous Section\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"midcell\"> <a class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-up.gif\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"rightcell\"> <a class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-right.gif\" title=\"Next Section\"/> </a> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div id=\"chap-id\">/bellezza2/b2-2-29/</div> <div style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\" class=\"jqmWindow\" id=\"chapRefWindow\"> <div class=\"closebtn\"> <a href=\"#\">Close</a> </div> <div style=\"height: 280px;\" class=\"conx-content\"> <h3>Note Citation for Page <span class=\"pgnm\"/> </h3> <p class=\"biblref\">John Vincent Bellezza, Antiquities of Zhang Zhung: A Comprehensive Inventory of Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Monuments on he Tibetan Upland (Charlottesville, VA 22904:Tibetan &amp; Himalayan Library, 2010), <span class=\"pgnm\"/>. </p> <h3>Bibliographic Citation</h3> <p>John Vincent Bellezza.
