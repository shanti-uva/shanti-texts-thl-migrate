The caves face south and east, the two preferred orientations of caves used for occupation in Tibet. The summit of brag mgo bzhag is surmounted by cobble structural remains. The summit complex measures 100 m x 7 m to 15 m. Most of the ruins seem to have long since slipped down the sides of the escarpment. This one ime strategic and defendable facility overlooks the confluence of the <span class=\"popular\">Sangdar Chu</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sangs dar chu</span> and the <span class=\"popular\">Langchen Tsangpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Glang chen gtsang po</span>. Just west of the site there is a highly weathered four-sided brown sandstone pillar in the valley bottom. This broken pillar has been reduced to 50 cm in height. The absence of adobe walls, he extreme degradation of the site and lack of evidence for Buddhist occupation seem to indicate an archaic cultural origin.</p> <h4 id=\"b1-1-29-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>None was obtained.</p> <h4 id=\"b1-1-29-4\">Site elements</h4> <h5 id=\"b1-1-29-4-1\">Summit complex</h5> <p>The arc-shaped summit is situated 60 m above the <span class=\"popular\">Sangdar Chu</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sangs dar chu</span>, situated to the east. Access is via a steep ravine that winds around north and east sides of the formation. There also may have once been a route up from the main group of caves but no signs of one remain. The other flanks of the formation are blocked by conglomerate outcrops. The original character and extent of the structures is not clear as very little remains of the site. On the highest part of the summit here are wall segments built against the formation approximately 6 m in length, which attain a height of 1 m to 1.5 m. These mud-mortared walls (up to 80 cm thick) were constructed of cobbles, 20 cm to 50 cm in length. There are several small caves on the summit as well.</p> <h4 id=\"b1-1-29-5\">Affiliated sites</h4> <h5 id=\"b1-1-29-5-1\">Sangs dar jo</h5> <p>On the opposite or west side of the <span class=\"popular\">Sangdar Chu</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sangs dar chu</span>, in the <span class=\"popular\">Langchen Tsangpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Glang chen gtsang po</span> valley, there are a number of ruined <span class=\"popular emph\">Ch&ouml;rten</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mchod rten</span> at<span> <span class=\"popular\">Sangdar Jo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sangs dar jo</span>. Some of these Buddhist monuments may date to the <span class=\"popular emph\">tenpa chidar</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">bstan pa phyi dar</span> (circa 980-1200 CE). This site is associated with a Buddhist god also named <span class=\"popular\">Sangdar Jo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sangs dar jo</span>. At<span> <span class=\"popular\">Sangdar Jo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sangs dar jo</span> there is a ruined settlement and long abandoned agricultural fields as well.</span></span></p> <h5 id=\"b1-1-29-5-2\">mTho lding castles</h5> <p>Rising above the plain of <span class=\"popular\">Toding</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mtho lding</span>, on the summits of the mesas bounding the south side of the <span class=\"popular\">Langchen Tsangpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Glang chen gtsang po</span> valley, are three sites called &lsquo;<span class=\"popular emph\">khar</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mkhar</span>&rsquo;. They include <span class=\"popular\">Khar Barma</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mkhar bar ma</span> (Middle Castle) located directly behind the town of <span class=\"popular\">Tsada</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rtsa mda&rsquo;</span>, <span class=\"popular\">Khar Okma</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mkhar &rsquo;og ma</span> (Lower Castle) located to the west, and <span class=\"popular\">Buri khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bu ri mkhar</span> (sp.?) further to the west. The former two sites are visible from the township headquarters while the later site is situated several kilometers to the east. Reportedly, here are no manmade ruins at <span class=\"popular\">Buri khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bu ri mkhar</span>.</p> <h5 id=\"b1-1-29-5-3\">mKhar &rsquo;og ma</h5> <p>According to the local oral tradition, <span class=\"popular\">Khar Okma</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mkhar &rsquo;og ma</span> was established by the founder of the <span class=\"popular\">Gug&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ge</span> dynasty <span class=\"popular\">Nyma G&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Nyi ma mgon</span> (tenth century CE). There are no longer clear signs of Buddhist monuments at this hilltop location (no <span class=\"popular emph\">Ch&ouml;rten</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mchod rten</span>, <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma ṇi</span> stones, fixtures for statuary, red ochre tinting, etc.). The main residential complex (34.5 m x 22 m) sits on the south summit of the <span class=\"popular\">Khar Okma</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mkhar &rsquo;og ma</span> formation (31&deg; 28.23 N. lat. / 79&deg; 47.34 E. long. / 4020m). This high point of the formation has excellent views of <span class=\"popular\">Toding</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mtho lding</span> and adjoining areas of the <span class=\"popular\">Langchen Tsangpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Glang chen gtsang po</span>valley. It is dominated by two tall mud-brick and rammed-earth edifices with massive walls. Timber fragments litter the area around one of the structures. On the lower-elevation north summit there is a single adobe and rammed-earth structure aligned in the cardinal directions containing seven rooms (31&deg; 28.34΄ N. lat. / 79&deg; 47.33΄ E. long. / 3970 m). Below the south summit, the highly eroded trail passes by various caves before entering a tunnel 23 m in length. This steeply inclined tunnel accesses the more open lower northern slopes of he formation and the monastic complex of<span class=\"popular\">Trashi G&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bkra shis mgon</span> (founded circa 1000 CE). Perennial sources of water are found in the gorges flanking both sides of the <span class=\"popular\">Khar Okma</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mkhar &rsquo;og ma</span> formation.</p> <h5 id=\"b1-1-29-5-4\">mKhar bar ma</h5> <p>The south summit complex of the smaller <span class=\"popular\">Khar Barma</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mkhar bar ma</span> is dominated by two large mud-brick and rammed-earth buildings (31&deg; 28.31΄ N. lat. / 79&deg; 47.93΄ E. long. / 4000 m). The lower structure contains a large hall with the faint remnants of <span class=\"popular emph\">tenpa chidar</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">bstan pa phyi dar</span> period frescoes at the base of the southeast corner. Four figures, three holding a baby Buddha, are visible. Below the paintings there is a band with highly damaged <span class=\"popular emph\">u m&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">dbu med</span> inscriptions. In close proximity there is a cave with an adobe block cubicle in front of it. On the rear wall of this cubicle there was a large fresco, which has been defaced by paint applications and by Chinese characters gouged into the surface. Below the south summit there are around wo dozen caves enroute to a prayer flag mast and ruined <span class=\"popular emph\">Ch&ouml;rten</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mchod rten</span>. A tunnel below the north summit accesses the northern flanks of the formation. On these flanks are the remains of an adobe block monastic facility (31&deg; 28.54 N. lat. / 79&deg; 48.01΄ E. long. / 3830 m).</p> <p>Roughly 60 m to the east of the Buddhist center, on the edge of a steep east-facing slope, here are the remains of a building (22 m x 14 m) built of sandstone. It was constructed with three distinct elevations. Revetments and freestanding wall segments reach a maximum height of 1.5 m. There is a subterranean room (7 m x 4 m x 1.7 m) below the second tier of the structure. Its east-facing entrance is accessed from the lower tier of the structure. This is the only edifice of its architectural type surveyed in the environs of <span class=\"popular\">Toding</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mtho lding</span>. Its age and function are enigmatic. The architectonic qualities of this edifice may suggest an early foundation date.</p> <table class=\"navarrows\" cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\"> <tbody> <tr> <td class=\"leftcell\"><a class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"> <img title=\"Previous Section\" src=\"../../../../../global/images/arrow-left.gif\" alt=\"\" /> </a></td> <td class=\"midcell\"><a class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"> <img title=\"Beginning of Article\" src=\"../../../../../global/images/arrow-up.gif\" alt=\"\" /> </a></td> <td class=\"rightcell\"><a class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"> <img title=\"Next Section\" src=\"../../../../../global/images/arrow-right.gif\" alt=\"\" /> </a></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div id=\"chap-id\">/bellezza/b1-1-29/</div> <div id=\"chapRefWindow\" class=\"jqmWindow\" style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\"> <div class=\"closebtn\"><a href=\"#\">Close</a></div> <div class=\"conx-content\" style=\"height: 280px;\"> <h3>Note Citation for Page <span class=\"pgnm\"> </span></h3> <p class=\"biblref\">John Vincent Bellezza, Antiquities of Zhang Zhung: A Comprehensive Inventory of Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Monuments on he Tibetan Upland (Charlottesville, VA 22904:Tibetan &amp; Himalayan Library, 2010), <span class=\"pgnm\">. </span></p> <h3>Bibliographic Citation</h3> <p>John Vincent Bellezza.
