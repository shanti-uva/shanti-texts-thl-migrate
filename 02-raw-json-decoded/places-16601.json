Below the site, a spring issues forth to join the valley\u0026rsquo;s watercourse. There are three ruined stone residential complexes on the steep hillside, constructed at different elevations, which exhibit archaic architectural traits. These three complexes have analogous constructional features and degradation characteristics, suggesting that they formed an integral site in terms of function and chronology. Walls are of the mud-mortared, random-rubble variety. The brown stones used in construction were mostly unworked, and tend to be smaller (10 cm to 40 cm in length), but longer examples are also found in the wall fabric.

The rear wall of the south building was built into the slope to a depth of 1 m. It appears to have contained a single room as there are no partition walls visible. The south building has the long, straight walls of a structure built with a timber roof. \u003c/p\u003e \u003ch5 id=\"b1-2-26-4-2\"\u003eMiddle complex\u003c/h5\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe middle complex is situated 7 m directly below the upper complex. It is comprised of two buildings. \u003c/p\u003e \u003ch6 class=\"essay\"\u003eSouth building\u003c/h6\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe south building (5.7 m x 4.5 m) appears to have contained just one room. The rear or west wall is built 3 m into the slope, giving the south building a strong semi-subterranean aspect. The forward or east wall is up o 4 m in height, half of this elevation being made up by a revetment. In the rear wall of the south building, about 1.9 m above the floor level, there are sockets that must have accommodated stone corbels or wooden beams. This architectural feature probably indicates that the south building was two stories tall. Similar sockets are encountered at \u003cspan class=\"popular\"\u003eWangchuk G\u0026ouml;npo Khar\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"scholar\"\u003eDbang phyug mgon po mkhar\u003c/span\u003e (A-51). Near the upper extent of the forward wall there are the remains of a 55-cm wide window. In the north wall at floor level there is an opening (40 cm x 45 cm), the function of which is unclear. There is also a small opening in the north wall that may have been designed for ventilation. Small remnants of mud plaster are found affixed to the interior walls of the south building. \u003c/p\u003e \u003ch6 class=\"essay\"\u003eNorth building\u003c/h6\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe north building stands 2.8 m north of the south building at the same elevation. The north building (9 m x 4.7 m) appears to have been partitioned into a single row of three rooms. In the south wall, which reaches a height of 2.7 m, there is a window opening (25 cm x 25 cm). The forward wall has been reduced to the revetment and freestanding fragments (a maximum of 50 cm in height). The forward wall has a total maximum height of 2 m. In the south room there are two small niches in the rear wall and in the rear wall of the middle room there is a larger niche. The south room is only 1.5 m in width and between it and the middle room there is an intervening 60-cm- to 80-cm-thick curved partition wall. There is a 90 cm gap between the south and middle rooms. The total length of the south and middle rooms is 5.5 m (north-south). The middle room is 3 m in width. At the foot of the revetment, below the middle room, there is a cavity (40 cm x 45 cm x 40 cm). The design features (heavy wall buttressing, room alignments and ground plan) of the south and middle rooms of the north building indicate that they were built with a stone roof. The north room of the north building is now little more than a section of revetment against the forward slope. The north room was narrower than the adjoining rooms.\u003c/p\u003e \u003ch5 id=\"b1-2-26-4-3\"\u003eLower complex\u003c/h5\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe lower complex consists of a single building divided into two rooms, which measures 8.4 m (north-south) x 3.8 m (east-west). The forward wall is over 2 m in height and is comprised mainly of a revetment. Freestanding walls have been mostly obliterated. From the available structural evidence, it could not be determined whether his structure had a stone or timber roof. \u003c/p\u003e \u003ch5 id=\"b1-2-26-4-4\"\u003eShrine \u003c/h5\u003e \u003cp\u003eAt the northwest or upper end of \u003cspan class=\"popular\"\u003eKhangpa Mar Gok\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"scholar\"\u003eKhang pa dmar gog\u003c/span\u003e there is a cubic structure (1.3 m x 1.3 m). It is situated 44 m north of the upper complex at 7 m higher elevation. On its downhill flank, this structure is 70 cm in height while its uphill side is flush with the slope. Such semi-subterranean aspect shrines are fairly common at the archaic residential centers of Upper Tibet, and are likely to have been used in the worship of elemental deities. On the top of the ruined ceremonial structure there is an old carved plaque. \u003c/p\u003e \u003ctable cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\" class=\"navarrows\"\u003e \u003ctbody\u003e \u003ctr\u003e \u003ctd class=\"leftcell\"\u003e \u003ca class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"\u003e \u003cimg src=\"/global/images/arrow-left.gif\" title=\"Previous Section\"/\u003e \u003c/a\u003e \u003c/td\u003e \u003ctd class=\"midcell\"\u003e \u003ca class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"\u003e \u003cimg src=\"/global/images/arrow-up.gif\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"/\u003e \u003c/a\u003e \u003c/td\u003e \u003ctd class=\"rightcell\"\u003e \u003ca class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"\u003e \u003cimg src=\"/global/images/arrow-right.gif\" title=\"Next Section\"/\u003e \u003c/a\u003e \u003c/td\u003e \u003c/tr\u003e \u003c/tbody\u003e \u003c/table\u003e \u003c/div\u003e \u003cdiv id=\"chap-id\"\u003e/bellezza/b1-2-26/\u003c/div\u003e \u003cdiv style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\" class=\"jqmWindow\" id=\"chapRefWindow\"\u003e \u003cdiv class=\"closebtn\"\u003e \u003ca href=\"#\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/div\u003e \u003cdiv style=\"height: 280px;\" class=\"conx-content\"\u003e \u003ch3\u003eNote Citation for Page \u003cspan class=\"pgnm\"/\u003e \u003c/h3\u003e \u003cp class=\"biblref\"\u003eJohn Vincent Bellezza, Antiquities of Zhang Zhung: A Comprehensive Inventory of Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Monuments on he Tibetan Upland (Charlottesville, VA 22904:Tibetan \u0026amp; Himalayan Library, 2010), \u003cspan class=\"pgnm\"/\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e \u003ch3\u003eBibliographic Citation\u003c/h3\u003e \u003cp\u003eJohn Vincent Bellezza.
