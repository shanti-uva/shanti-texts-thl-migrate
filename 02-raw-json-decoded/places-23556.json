Name</h4> <p>The monastery&rsquo;s full name is bShad sgrub bstan rgyas bkra shis g-yung drung gling; it was also known as Ye shes spos mdud dgon or Ye shes bshad sgrub gling.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-8-1-2\">2. Location</h4> <p>The monastery is located on the south bank of a stream in Gong shod valley, 5 km east of Ri snang, the seat of Nyag rong county. Gong shod valley is one of the &ldquo;eighteen large valleys&rdquo; (Shod chen bco brgyad) of Nyag rong county. The site of the monastery is called Brag dmar mdo rtsa (literally &ldquo;foot of the red rock&rdquo;), because it is located at the foot of a red rock (Brag dmar). </p> <h4 id=\"b6-8-1-3\">3. History</h4> <p>According to oral tradition, during the persecution of Bon under the reign of King Khri srong lde btsan, many Bonpo masters fled from central Tibet, and thus a master called sTag gsas came to Me nyag, and became known as Me nyag sTag gsas. The Bonpo scholar and historian Shar rdza bKra shis rgyal mtshan (1858-1934) also mentions this personage in his historical work.<a href=\"#n13\" name=\"nb13\" class=\"note\">13</a> It is also said that Me nyag sTag gsas and rMa lHa rgod of Nyag rong are in fact one and the same. There is a prayer text entitled Lo rgyus gsol &rsquo;debs (MS) in Ye shes Monastery mentioning that &ldquo;the great and powerful hero Me nyag sTag gsas came to Me nyag under the name of rMa gsas lHa rgod&rdquo;.<a href=\"#n14\" name=\"nb14\" class=\"note\">14</a> </p> <p>The son of rMa lHa rgod was called Nam mkha&rsquo; ye shes. He received teachings from his father and then travelled extensively to propagate the Bon religion. He won the esteem and support of Klu rgyal, the chief of Nyag rong who helped him build a monastery at Brag dmar mdo rtsa in his honour. The monastery was named Ye shes Monastery after him. Since the monastery consisted of temples (lha khang), the place became known as Lha khang thang, the &ldquo;plain of temples&rdquo;.</p> <p>Three generations of Nyag rong chiefs acted as patrons of Nam mkha&rsquo; ye shes: Klu rgyal, his son Klu mgon and his grandson Klu skyabs.<a href=\"#n15\" name=\"nb15\" class=\"note\">15</a> Nam mkha&rsquo; ye shes was succeeded by Cang mkhar spo sByin pa rgyal mtshan<a href=\"#n16\" name=\"nb16\" class=\"note\">16</a> who spent the first half of his life in Ye shes Monastery, and then left the monastery to live in a hermitage which he founded on a hill called Dar ri, which is why he is also locally known as Dar ri sByin pa rgyal mtshan. Although Rig &rsquo;dzin nyi ma does give precise dates in his historical work with regard to the masters mentioned above, I am not sure they are accurate and prefer not to use them here.<a href=\"#n17\" name=\"nb17\" class=\"note\">17</a> </p> <p>Because Klu thar had no male heirs, the lineage of local chiefs was discontinued. </p> <p>There was also a master called rTogs ldan bKra shis rgyal mtshan who became a famous ascetic in the area; he is also known as Nub rTogs ldan bKra shis rgyal mtshan. His brother, Mo the<a href=\"#n18\" name=\"nb18\" class=\"note\">18</a> Tshul khrims rgyal mtshan, was a lay tantric practictioner and founded sKya thu li temple at La rked stod and gShel lo temple at La rked smad in Nyag rong; because he was very active in La sked, he was also known as Nyag sked tshang, and it is said that his lineage continued to be active in the area for seventeen generations. </p> <p>During the time of mGon po rnam rgyal, a chief of Nyag rong, gSang mchog, a descendent of Khod spungs sGrub gshen snang ldan, Zla ba grags pa, a descendent of Mo the lineage, gYung drung rgyal mtshan, a son of &rsquo;Od zer gling pa, and Nyag stod sTong ldan mgon po, agreed to rebuild Ye shes Monastery in which three small monasteries were merged as one monastery.</p> <p>Later Nyag stod sTong ldan mgon po acted as a patron of the monastery and renamed it Ye shes bshad sgrub gling. According to Rig &rsquo;dzin nyi ma this took place in 1848.<a href=\"#n19\" name=\"nb19\" class=\"note\">19</a> In 1908, Shar rdza bKra shis rgyal mtshan visited the monastery. In 1909, Khyung po Nyi ma rgyal mtshan and Tshul khrims mchog rgyal added an assembly hall (&rsquo;du khang) with twelve columns. Both were disciples of Shar rdza bKra shis rgyal mtshan. Nyi ma rgyal mtshan had two sons, gYung drung bdud &rsquo;dul and Ri kho alias Thugs rje gling pa. The former succeeded him after his death. The latter discovered numerous gter ma texts in several places in Khams and taught them throughout the area. </p> <p>During the Cultural Revolution the monastery was destroyed, but its reconstruction was undertaken in 1983 with the help of A yung, alias gYung drung bstan pa&rsquo;i rgyal mtshan (1922-1996). In his youth, he was recognized as the reincarnation of a master called Dri med &rsquo;od zer, and the abbot of the monastery,Tshul khrims mchog rgyal, kept him in the monastery. In fact the abbot was a brother of his grandfather. He studied under the abbot, gTer ston Tshe dbang &rsquo;gyur med, dBra ston bsKal bzang bstan pa&rsquo;i rgyal mtshan (1897-1959)<a href=\"#n20\" name=\"nb20\" class=\"note\">20</a> (10) and rGyal tshab Blo gros rgyal mtsho. </p> <p>Later A yung became vice-president of the Political Consultative Conference of dKar mdzes Prefecture, and it was in this capacity he was able to help to rebuild Ye shes Monastery and other local Bonpo monasteries. He worked hard to promote education in Bonpo monasteries in dKar mdzes Prefecture. When I visited dKar mdzes Prefecture in 1997, I saw his photograph in almost every monastery. I then realized how popular he was among the Bonpo community. </p> <p>In the 1980s, a manuscript copy the Bonpo Kanjur was brought out at dBal khyung Monastery. It was hidden away during the turbulent history. As it turned out, it was the only complete extant copy of the Bonpo Canon. Its publication, owing to the strenuous efforts of A yung and his friend Shug sdong sKal bzang phun tshogs, represents a major contribution to Tibetan cultural heritage, although the published version is not an exact replica of the dBal khyung manuscript. Alongside A yung, another important figure of the monastery was the master gYung drung bdud &rsquo;dul (?-1995). </p> <p>In 1983, the authorities granted the monastery permission to reopen. Thanks to A yung and gYung drung bdud &rsquo;dul, and the financial support and labour provided by the local lay community, the monastery was rebuilt and is now one of the most important centres in the region. A rgyal or sKal bzang rgya mtsho, a brother of A yung and &rsquo;Khrin las kun khyab, the son of gYung drung bdud &rsquo;dul, are the present leaders of the monastery.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-8-1-4\">4.

Local festivals</h4> <p>There is a mountain called sKyobs &rsquo;byin seng nag surrounded by twelve peaks about 25 km south of the county town of Nyag rong rdzong. The local deity (yul lha), believed to be residing on it, is propitiated by the local people of the villages mentioned above, but the date of the propitiation is not fixed. It may fall any time between the beginning of the 5th month to the beginning of the 8th month. </p> <p>There is also a &ldquo;sacred mountain&rdquo; (gnas ri) called Brag dkar lhang lhang nor bu yang rtse located about 40 km west of Nyag rong rdzong county town. It was a &ldquo;site of hidden treasures&rdquo; (gter gnas) where Sangs rgyas gling pa discovered many concealed texts (gter ma) and consequently he converted the site what is known as &ldquo;to open doors of the site&rdquo; (gnas sgo phyed pa) i.e. revealed the site as a sacred place. The date of its veneration is not fixed and may fall any time between the beginning of the 5th month to the beginning of the 8th month of every Dragon Year. In the past, both Bonpo and Buddhist people circumambulated the mountain in the Bonpo way, that is, keeping the mountain on the left as one follows the path of the circuit, but after Nyag bla Pad ma bdud &rsquo;dul, a rNying ma pa master, said that both ways were appropriate and had the same religious efficacy, Buddhists began to circumambulate the mountain in the clockwise direction.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-8-1-13\">14.
