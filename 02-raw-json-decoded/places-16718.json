It is generally aligned in the cardinal directions and measures 19 m x 19 m. This elaborately built square enclosure is elevated about 50 cm above the surrounding terrain. The enclosure, located near the western extremity of the enclosed pillar typology territorial range, represents a unique variant of the monument. It is bisected into two sections by an east-west running wall. The north section is 12.5 m in width and the south section is 6.5 m wide. The north section is further subdivided by a north-south aligned wall (7.6 m long) that joins the central bisecting wall and an east-west aligned wall (6 m long) that joins the east perimeter wall to form an inner enclosure. The double-course and multiple-course cobble perimeter and subdividing walls (50 cm to 80 cm thick) are composed of different colored (tan, red, gray, and beige) variable-length cobbles (10 cm to 35 cm long). The coherent wall sections are mostly level with the ground surface. There are also disintegrated portions of the perimeter walls composed of stones, which are piled up to a maximum height of 50 cm. These elevated wall sections may have been composed of several vertical courses of cobbles.\u003c/p\u003e \u003ch5 id=\"b2-1-76-4-2\"\u003ePillars\u003c/h5\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn the north section of the enclosure there is a single highly weathered pillar (Long-stone DR1), which is centered between the north and south walls. This four-sided grayish pillar (1.3 m [height] x 80 cm [basal girth]) stands next to the inner edge of the west wall. In the south section of the enclosure there is a not well centered highly weathered tan tabular pillar (1.2 m x 1 m) (Long-stone DR2). It was erected next to the inner edge of the west wall. There are two smaller gray pillars (Long-stones DR3, DR4) 60 cm in height, which were planted against the inner edge of the south wall, near the west end of the enclosure. There are also three broken pillars (Long-stones DR5, DR6, DR7) that were erected within the cobble courses of the south wall. Another broken pillar (Long-stone DR8) was raised inside the south wall near the east end of the enclosure. It appears that yet another small specimen was erected within the courses of the central bisecting wall of the enclosure. The erection of standing stones inside the wall courses is a highly unusual morphological feature of he \u003cspan class=\"popular\"\u003eChunak\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"scholar\"\u003eChu nag\u003c/span\u003e site. By virtue of their presence among scores of superficial enclosures, the walled pillars must have fulfilled an extremely important funerary ritual role at \u003cspan class=\"popular\"\u003eChunak\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"scholar\"\u003eChu nag\u003c/span\u003e. The location of the walled pillars at the eastern extremity of the site is also liable to have significant ritual and cognitive undertones. \u003c/p\u003e \u003ch5 id=\"b2-1-76-4-3\"\u003eTumulus\u003c/h5\u003e \u003cp\u003eApproximately 50 m west of the walled pillars there is large quadrate tumulus (\u003cspan class=\"popular emph\"\u003ebangso\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"scholar emph\"\u003ebang so\u003c/span\u003e) (09.796\u0026#900; / 39.008\u0026#900;). This tumulus is roughly aligned in the cardinal directions, and measures 17.8 m (north-south) x 15 m (east-west). This flat-topped structure varies between 2 m and 3 m in height. The surface of the mound is covered in loose cobbles; whatever coherent walls here were have completely disintegrated. On the top of the tumulus there are three cobble-filled depressions up o 1 m in depth. They appear to be the result of excavations carried out long ago. The looting of the contents is likely to be the only motive for such excavations in pre-modern times. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOn the east side of the tumulus, at its base, there is a large interconnected rectangular enclosure that measures 22 m (north-south) x 8 m (east-west). It is elevated about 50 cm above the surrounding plain. This enclosure is comprised of walls such as are found in other enclosures of \u003cspan class=\"popular\"\u003eChunak\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"scholar\"\u003eChu nag\u003c/span\u003e.

These two umuli more or less circumscribe the eastern and western margins of the core Upper Tibetan paleocultural entity; hat region in which walled pillars (II.1b) and pillar arrays appended to edifices (II.1c) are distributed. The umulus of \u003cspan class=\"popular\"\u003eChunak\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"scholar\"\u003eChu nag\u003c/span\u003e appears to have been a central monumental feature of the site. In sites where there is a large \u003cspan class=\"popular emph\"\u003ebangso\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"scholar emph\"\u003ebang so\u003c/span\u003e it often is found amid smaller and more superficial funerary structures. These large \u003cspan class=\"popular emph\"\u003ebangso\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"scholar emph\"\u003ebang so\u003c/span\u003e are probably the burial sites of very high status individuals and/or where collective mortuary rites took place. In any case, it would appear that they constituted the ritual and monumental heart of many necropoli. \u003c/p\u003e \u003ch5 id=\"b2-1-76-4-4\"\u003eClusters of enclosures\u003c/h5\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe superficial enclosures are mainly square and rectangular in form but there are also some sub-rectangular examples among them. They range between 3 m x 5 m to 15 m x 16 m in size. The perimeter walls (50 cm to 1 m hick) are composed of different colored (tan, red, gray, and beige) cobbles, which are between 10 cm and 35 cm in length. Many of the extant walls are generally aligned in the cardinal directions. The cobble perimeter walls are double-course or multiple-course in make-up. These walls are typically flush with the ground surface. There are also what appear to be heaped-stone walls 20 cm to 50 in height. In a few enclosures, these elevated wall sections reach 1 m in height. Rather than an inherent design feature, this piling of stones is probably due to he disintegration of neatly built walls, which were more than 1 vertical course in height. In all but a few cases, the area inside the perimeter walls of each enclosure is free of structural elements. There are also a few outlying structures of smaller proportions that are fully covered in stones embedded in the ground surface. The enclosures are interconnected to form clusters or networks of structures. The design and construction of hese enclosures most resembles those of \u003cspan class=\"popular\"\u003eDrak Tsangpo\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"scholar\"\u003eBrag gtsang po\u003c/span\u003e (D-41), a site not too far away from \u003cspan class=\"popular\"\u003eChunak\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"scholar\"\u003eChu nag\u003c/span\u003e. Many of the walls of the enclosures have been destroyed and many have depressions inside. These depressions are probably the result of excavations carried out long ago and possibly due to subsidence as well. \u003c/p\u003e \u003ch6 class=\"essay\"\u003eMain cluster of enclosures\u003c/h6\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe main cluster of enclosures begins 24 m west of the large tumulus. This long swathe of interconnected enclosures has two obvious breaks, creating three different sectors. Small amounts of white quartz are scattered around the main cluster of enclosures. These pieces of stones may have embellished the structures but in what form is unknown. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe north sector (63 m x 23 m) has a north-south axis. It contains around 30 enclosures, measuring between 2 m x 5 m and 7 m x 10 m. The north end of the north sector is at 09.963\u0026#900; / 38.931\u0026#900;. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe central sector of enclosures begins 40 m south of the north sector. It measures 380 m x 40 m to 60 m and covers some 13,000 m\u0026sup2;. The central sector contains about 200 enclosures ranging in size up to 16 m x 15 m. In a few places there are small gaps between the groups of enclosures. The northern half of the central sector has a north-west axis, but further south the axis bends to the east. At the northwest corner of the central sector, a large enclosure (16 m x 15 m) contains a smaller enclosure (6 m x 7 m) inside its perimeter walls. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThere is a gap of 8 m between the central and south sectors. The south sector measures 88 m x 25 m and erminates near the \u003cspan class=\"popular\"\u003eChunak\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"scholar\"\u003eChu nag\u003c/span\u003e stream (09.669\u0026#900; / 39.035\u0026#900;). This cluster has an east-west axis. The south sector contains perhaps 25 enclosures. In proximity to he south sector there are approximately 15 smaller enclosures aggregated in little groupings. Beginning about 200 m west of the south sector there is another cluster containing about 23 enclosures distributed over a fairly large area. \u003c/p\u003e \u003ch6 class=\"essay\"\u003eUpper cluster of enclosures\u003c/h6\u003e \u003cp\u003eTo the west of the flat in which the main cluster of enclosures is located there is a bench about 30 m higher in elevation. On this bench is the upper cluster of enclosures (09.938\u0026#900; / 38.708\u0026#900;). The principal upper cluster measures 67 m (north-south) x 30 m (east-west), and contains about 20 enclosures of the kind found elsewhere at \u003cspan class=\"popular\"\u003eChunak\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"scholar\"\u003eChu nag\u003c/span\u003e. Many of the perimeter walls have been destroyed and depressions, up to 1.5 m in depth, pockmark the interiors of quite a few enclosures.
