Name </h4> <p>The monastery is usually known as Brag steng gYung drung dar rgyas gling. </p> <h4 id=\"b6-11-4-2\">2. Location</h4> <p>The monastery is located on the bank of Yongtze river 27 km south of the county town of Rong brag. </p> <h4 id=\"b6-11-4-3\">3. History</h4> <p>A precise date of foundation of the monastery is not known, but it is said to have been founded by Sangs rgyas gling pa acccording to gNyags Chos nyid rdo rje (gYung drung dar rgyas gling, MS p.1).

The same Sources also suggests that the monastery was founded prior to the destruction of gYung drung lta steng Monastery (No. 187). The monastery had the Brag steng king as its benefactor and the king was an ardent supporter of gYung drung lta steng which was destroyed by Qianlong in 1776.<a href=\"#n49\" name=\"nb49\" class=\"note\">49</a> Because of this reason, monks of the monastery were forced to leave the monastery and live in the villages. They had later several monasteries built, for example, Shan co,<a href=\"#n50\" name=\"nb50\" class=\"note\">50</a> Zhi ba sa le<a href=\"#n51\" name=\"nb51\" class=\"note\">51</a> and Mu chu la rgod.<a href=\"#n52\" name=\"nb52\" class=\"note\">52</a> </p> <p>The monastery produced several famous masters, such as Tu phyag Phyogs las rnam rgyal who was born in rJe lung valley which is five kilometers northeast of the monastery and mTshams pa dge bshes (his real name is unknown) was born in She co valley, but there is very little information about theses masters. </p> <p>In 1940 the monastery was moved and rebuilt by rGyal sprul, a master from Brag &rsquo;go and Nyi ma dbang ldan, the king of Brag steng at the present site. It was active until the middle of the twentieth century.
