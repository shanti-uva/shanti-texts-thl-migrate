The site consists of two pillar installations spaced roughly 300 m apart. While <span class=\"popular\">Jangde Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Byang sde rdo ring</span> has no contemporary religious function, pieces of milky quartz scattered around both enclosures suggest an earlier ritual usage of the site. </p> <h4 id=\"b2-1-4-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p> <span class=\"popular\">Jangde Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Byang sde rdo ring</span> and other <span class=\"popular emph\">Doring</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rdo ring</span> sites in the same general area (upper <span class=\"popular\">Yarlung Tsangpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Yar lung gtsang po</span> drainage basin) are considered he haunts of elemental spirits such as the btsan. These pillar complexes are thought to have appeared with the emergence of the universe. According to one local source, they were built by he <span class=\"popular\">dr&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">&rsquo;Dre</span> demons.

The soil is thin and rocky and partially covered in tundra. The complex is endowed with wide views to east and west. </p> <h6 class=\"essay\">Enclosure</h6> <p>The well-preserved square enclosure is not well aligned in the cardinal directions. It measures 13 m to 13.5 m on each of its four sides. The robustly built superficial walls of the enclosure are 60 cm to 70 cm thick and are composed of stones up to 70 cm in length. Upright stones in the enclosure protrude as much as 25 cm above the ground surface. In the center of the east wall there is a small opening formed by large stones that lie perpendicular to the wall course. </p> <h6 class=\"essay\">Pillars</h6> <p>Ten in situ standing stones form an 8-m long row situated about 1 m from the inner edge of the west wall (the least well preserved wall of the enclosure). The tall thin pillars were roughly hewn from the same blue-gray stone used to build the enclosure. The pillars host some orange climax lichen. From north to south, the dimensions and characteristics of these menhirs are as follows:</p> <ol> <li>Long-stone DR1: irregularly shaped (1.3 m [height] x 1 m [basal girth]).</li> <li>Long-stone DR2: tabular (80 cm x 1 m).</li> <li>Long-stone DR3: four-sided (80 cm x 75 cm).</li> <li>Long-stone DR4: tabular, inclined (1.7 m x 1.1 m).</li> <li>Long-stone DR5: tabular, severely inclined (2 m x 1.2 m).</li> <li>Long-stone DR6: four-sided, severely inclined (2 m x 1 m).</li> <li>Long-stone DR7: three-sided (1.9 m x 1.1 m). </li> <li>Long-stone DR8: four-sided (1.8 m x 1 m).</li> <li>Long-stone DR9: irregularly shaped, inclined (1 m x 1 m).</li> <li>Long-stone DR10: four-sided, severely inclined (1.7 m x 1 m).</li> </ol> <p>In addition to the ten in situ pillars there are six more specimens in the same row that are broken near ground level. About 10 m west of the west wall of the enclosure there is a structure (2.5 m x 2.5 m) that is nearly flush with the ground surface. Its construction indicates that it is an integral part of the pillar complex. This structure appears to be a funerary superstructure of some kind.</p> <h5 id=\"b2-1-4-4-2\">Byang sde rdo ring West</h5> <p> <span class=\"popular\">Jangde Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Byang sde rdo ring</span> West was built on ground that gently rises to the west (30&deg; 02.466 N. lat. / 83&deg; 47.313&#900; E. long.). The soil cover is poor and the views to the east are not as expansive as those from <span class=\"popular\">Jangde Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Byang sde rdo ring</span> East. </p> <h6 class=\"essay\">Enclosure</h6> <p>The enclosure is not well aligned in the cardinal directions. It measures 11 m (east-west) x 5.5 m (north-south). A good portion of all four walls of the enclosure have survived. These less robustly constructed superficial walls are around 50 cm thick and composed of stones 40 cm or less in length. The stones protrude up to 10 cm above the ground surface. </p> <h6 class=\"essay\">Pillars</h6> <p>Four undressed pillars stand near the inner edge of the west wall of the enclosure, forming a row 2 m in length. These standing stones sport some orange climax lichen. From south to north, the dimensions and characteristics of the pillars are as follows:</p> <ol> <li>Long-stone DR1: four-sided (90 cm x 1 m).</li> <li>Long-stone DR2: tabular (90 cm x 1.2 m).</li> <li>Long-stone DR3: four-sided (80 cm x 70 cm).</li> <li>Long-stone DR4: irregularly shaped (90 cm x 80 cm). </li> </ol> <table cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\" class=\"navarrows\"> <tbody> <tr> <td class=\"leftcell\"> <a class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-left.gif\" title=\"Previous Section\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"midcell\"> <a class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-up.gif\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"rightcell\"> <a class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-right.gif\" title=\"Next Section\"/> </a> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div id=\"chap-id\">/bellezza2/b2-1-4/</div> <div style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\" class=\"jqmWindow\" id=\"chapRefWindow\"> <div class=\"closebtn\"> <a href=\"#\">Close</a> </div> <div style=\"height: 280px;\" class=\"conx-content\"> <h3>Note Citation for Page <span class=\"pgnm\"/> </h3> <p class=\"biblref\">John Vincent Bellezza, Antiquities of Zhang Zhung: A Comprehensive Inventory of Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Monuments on he Tibetan Upland (Charlottesville, VA 22904:Tibetan &amp; Himalayan Library, 2010), <span class=\"pgnm\"/>. </p> <h3>Bibliographic Citation</h3> <p>John Vincent Bellezza.
