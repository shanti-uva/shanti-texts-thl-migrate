Location </h4> <p>The monastery is located on the bank of the Yangtze river, 5 km southeast of Rong brag, the county seat.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-11-2-3\">3. History </h4> <p>The original site of the monastery is in Sha ba mtsho near Sog po ri rtse in the same county and the ruins of the former monastery are still visible. The monastery was moved to its present site by a master called gDan khri for an unknown reason. According to a legend recorded by gNyags Chos nyid rdo rje (gYung drung bde ldan gling, MS., p.1), in the thirteenth Rab byung (1747-1806), dGongs rtse gYung drung tshul khrims, who had studied at sMan ri, occupied the monastery&rsquo;s throne. One night, one of his boots disappeared and was found on a dune on the bank of the Yangtze river. dGongs rtse gYung drung tshul khrims took this as a prophecy and thus moved the monastery to the place where the boot was rediscovered, which is the present site of the monastery. The monastery was therefore called Bye &rsquo;bur dgon pa, &ldquo;the dune monastery&rdquo;. The monastery was demolished during the Cultural Revolution and rebuilt in the 1980s.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-11-2-4\">4.
