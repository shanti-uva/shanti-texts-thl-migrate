The <span class=\"popular\">Drlung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo ring lung</span> valley is very narrow, and approximately 20 m east of the pillars there is the gully that drains the valley during heavy downpours and the melting of stone. <span class=\"popular\">Langa Tso</span><span class=\"scholar\">La lnga mtsho</span> to the east is partly visible from the site. The views to the west are cut by the slopes at the head of the <span class=\"popular\">Drlung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo ring lung</span> valley. The terrain is grassy, gravelly and gently sloping. There are 12 in situ gray and tan standing pillars of significant stature at <span class=\"popular\">Doring Lung Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo ring lung rdo ring</span>. They are heavily eroded, inclined at various angles and are host to orange climax lichen. The standing stones of <span class=\"popular\">Doring Lung Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo ring lung rdo ring</span> tend to have four uneven sides of more or less the same width. Stones lying about the site as well as the slightly elevated position of the pillars above he surrounding slope may possibly indicate that an enclosure or other structures once accompanied the pillars. </p> <h4 id=\"b2-1-50-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>None was collected.</p> <h4 id=\"b2-1-50-4\">Site elements</h4> <p>The pillars have the following dimensions and characteristics:</p> <ol> <li>Long-stone DR1: situated south of the main row of pillars and to the east of its axis (90 cm [height] x 1 m [basal girth]).</li> <li>Long-stone DR2: situated south of the main row of pillars and to the west of its axis (1.7 m height).
