The site is situated on the left side of the valley not far upstream from where it joins with the right fork of the <span class=\"popular\">Rama</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ra ma</span> valley. <span class=\"popular\">Trandra M&ouml;ndur</span><span class=\"scholar\">Khra &rsquo;dra mon dur</span> is one of three funerary sites in the <span class=\"popular\">Rama</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ra ma</span> valley (see D-94 and D-96). On a sandy bench, there are four funerary enclosures of two or three different constructions. They were built of uncut variable-length pieces of a blue-gray rock and a harder speckled gray rock.</p> <h4 id=\"b2-2-55-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>In <span class=\"popular\">Reco</span><span class=\"scholar\">Re co</span>, structures such as those found at <span class=\"popular\">Trandra</span><span class=\"scholar\">Khra &rsquo;dra</span> are generally attributed to the ancient <span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span>.</p> <h4 id=\"b2-2-55-4\">Site elements</h4> <h5 id=\"b2-2-55-4-1\">Funerary Structure FS1</h5> <p>Funerary structure FS1 (2.2 m x 3 m) appears to have had a superstructure consisting of high upright slab outer walls inside of which is stone paving (33&deg; 20.992&#900; N. lat. / 79&deg; 17.322&#900; E. long. / 4540 m). FS1 constitutes a distinctively designed funerary structure. Its surface is completely covered in stones embedded in the ground. The upright stones of the single-course rectangular perimeter walls project as much as 30 cm to 40 cm above the ground surface. The four walls of FS1 are generally aligned in the cardinal directions. The entire structure is elevated around 50 cm above the surrounding terrain. A cairn was recently raised on one corner of FS1.</p> <h5 id=\"b2-2-55-4-2\">Funerary Structure FS2</h5> <p>Funerary structure FS2 (3.6 m x 2.6 m) is situated 2.3 m down valley of FS1. The single-course perimeter walls are in poor condition. The enclosure is aligned in the cardinal directions, and is elevated about 80 above the surrounding terrain. Embedded stones completely cover the area within the perimeter walls. FS2 is likely to be of the same design as FS1. </p> <h5 id=\"b2-2-55-4-3\">Funerary Structure FS3</h5> <p>Funerary structure FS3 (3.6 m x 3.4 m) is situated further down valley near the foot of a rocky spur (21.270&#900; / 17.804&#900; / 4530 m). This structure is in very poor condition.</p> <h5 id=\"b2-2-55-4-4\">Funerary Structure FS4</h5> <p>Funerary structure FS4 (14 m x 6.5 m) is situated 6.5 m north of FS3. This enclosure is not aligned in the cardinal directions and is level with the ground surface. It is divided into three east-west cells. The west cell has been partly destroyed. The central and east cells are largely intact but do not have coherent walls. Approximately 100 m farther down valley are other enclosures of uncertain typology. These merge with the erraces of defunct agricultural fields.</p> <table cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\" class=\"navarrows\"> <tbody> <tr> <td class=\"leftcell\"> <a class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-left.gif\" title=\"Previous Section\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"midcell\"> <a class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-up.gif\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"rightcell\"> <a class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-right.gif\" title=\"Next Section\"/> </a> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div id=\"chap-id\">/bellezza2/b2-2-55/</div> <div style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\" class=\"jqmWindow\" id=\"chapRefWindow\"> <div class=\"closebtn\"> <a href=\"#\">Close</a> </div> <div style=\"height: 280px;\" class=\"conx-content\"> <h3>Note Citation for Page <span class=\"pgnm\"/> </h3> <p class=\"biblref\">John Vincent Bellezza, Antiquities of Zhang Zhung: A Comprehensive Inventory of Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Monuments on he Tibetan Upland (Charlottesville, VA 22904:Tibetan &amp; Himalayan Library, 2010), <span class=\"pgnm\"/>. </p> <h3>Bibliographic Citation</h3> <p>John Vincent Bellezza.
