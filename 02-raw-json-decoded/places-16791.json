It is in view of the sacred mountains, <span class=\"popular\">Namra</span><span class=\"scholar\">Nam ra</span> and <span class=\"popular\">kyungka</span><span class=\"scholar\">Skyung ka</span>. The six terraced funerary structures of the site form two rows spread out laterally over a broad, turf-covered slope with around a 15&deg; gradient. There are three terraced funerary structures in each row. These consist of quadrate structures built in the manner common in the far eastern <span class=\"popular\">Jangtang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Byang thang</span> (flat top, high forward flank, flush or inset rear flank. etc.). With few exceptions, integral wall segments have not persisted at <span class=\"popular\">Marrong</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dmar rong</span>. The superstructures are constructed of variable-length (20 cm to 90 cm) stones. The exterior faces of a few of these stones may have been cut flat. <span class=\"popular\">Marrong</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dmar rong</span> does not appear to have been disturbed in recent times. </p> <h4 id=\"b2-2-39-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>According to local <span class=\"popular emph\">drok pa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">&rsquo;brog pa</span>, <span class=\"popular\">Marrong</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dmar rong</span> consists of ancient remains.</p> <h4 id=\"b2-2-39-4\">Site elements</h4> <h5 id=\"b2-2-39-4-1\">East group</h5> <p>The three east group structures form a row 28 m long. These structures are not aligned in the cardinal directions. They are made of a white calcareous rock and a grayish volcanic (?) rock. All three funerary structures of the east group are overgrown with nettles. </p> <h6 class=\"essay\">Funerary Structure FS1</h6> <p>Funerary structure FS1 (4.2 m x 4 m) has parts of its four walls intact (31&deg; 34.979&#900; N. lat. / 90&deg; 56.932&#900;). The forward flank is elevated to a height of around 1.2 m above the downhill slope. The rear wall is either even with the uphill slope or set below it as much as 20 cm. </p> <h6 class=\"essay\">Funerary Structure FS2</h6> <p>Funerary structure FS2 (5.1 m x 4.2 m) has a forward flank elevated about 1.2 m above the downhill slope (34.977&#900; / 56.925&#900;). Small portions of coherently built side walls are extant. These double-course walls (70 cm thick) consist of three layers of stones and attain a height of 30 cm.</p> <h6 class=\"essay\">Funerary Structure FS3</h6> <p>Funerary structure FS3 (5.6 m x 4.4 m) has a forward flank 1.5 m in height and a rear wall flush with the slope (34.975&#900; / 56.922&#900;). The double-course side wall (around 70 cm thick) fragments are composed of four layers of stones and reach 35 cm in height. </p> <h5 id=\"b2-2-39-4-2\">West group</h5> <p>The west group of funerary structures is situated 17.5 m west of the east group. These structures are mostly made of a different type of rock (igneous?).</p> <h6 class=\"essay\">Funerary Structure FS4</h6> <p>Funerary structure FS4 (5.2 m x 4.3 m) has small portions of all four walls intact (34.951&#900; / 56.832&#900;). The forward flank has a height of about 1.5 m. </p> <h6 class=\"essay\">Funerary Structure FS5</h6> <p>Funerary structure FS5 (6.2 m x 5.3 m) has parts of all four walls intact (34.951 / 56.831). The forward flank has a height of about 1.5 m, while the rear wall is set 20 cm below the slope. One double-course side wall segment is approximately 1 m thick. </p> <h6 class=\"essay\">Funerary Structure FS6</h6> <p>Funerary structure FS6 (7.3 m x 4.7 m) appears to be aligned in the cardinal directions. Despite changes to he slope having damaged the upper portion of the structure, its lower part is the best preserved structure at <span class=\"popular\">Marrong</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dmar rong</span>. The corner where the south and west walls are joined is intact, showing that FS6 was a neatly built quadrate structure. This corner is made up of three vertical courses of masonry and has a height of 30 cm. Small fragments of blue and red slate are found on the structure, which possibly may have been part of its subsurface architecture. </p> <table cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\" class=\"navarrows\"> <tbody> <tr> <td class=\"leftcell\"> <a class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-left.gif\" title=\"Previous Section\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"midcell\"> <a class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-up.gif\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"rightcell\"> <a class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-right.gif\" title=\"Next Section\"/> </a> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div id=\"chap-id\">/bellezza2/b2-2-39/</div> <div style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\" class=\"jqmWindow\" id=\"chapRefWindow\"> <div class=\"closebtn\"> <a href=\"#\">Close</a> </div> <div style=\"height: 280px;\" class=\"conx-content\"> <h3>Note Citation for Page <span class=\"pgnm\"/> </h3> <p class=\"biblref\">John Vincent Bellezza, Antiquities of Zhang Zhung: A Comprehensive Inventory of Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Monuments on he Tibetan Upland (Charlottesville, VA 22904:Tibetan &amp; Himalayan Library, 2010), <span class=\"pgnm\"/>. </p> <h3>Bibliographic Citation</h3> <p>John Vincent Bellezza.
