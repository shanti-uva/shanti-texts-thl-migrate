It is a traditional \u0026ldquo;Tantric monastery\u0026rdquo;, small but influential, and has been in a state of stability with no serious ups and downs for a long time. History does not tell clearly the individual names of every lama who has cared for and protected the monastery so far, but it is said that descendants in the Ko bo lineage, one of the three descent groups of the region called Ko bo, Rag shi and Shel sku took care of the monastery and rendered great service in keeping, defending and spreading the doctrine of Eternal Bon.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eLater, in the Fifteenth Rab byung, Me ston Nyi ma rgyal mtshan, a hermit from Brag dmar ri \u0026rsquo;dun in Khyung po, and sTag zhig Rin chen dbang ldan, a disciple of Grub chen sMon lam rgyal mtshan, on their way to Kong po, established a close patron-priest relationship with the villagers and monks of rGyal shod. Acceding to the wishes expressed by the Shel sku villagers, these hermits decided to take care of the dNgul kho Monastery.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSeveral years after that, sTag zhig Rin dbang, accompanied by some others, arrived in rGyal shod and became the head of this monastery.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAt the end of the Fifteenth Rab byung, dNgul kho Monastery was moved from dNgul kho village to the western outskirts, midway up the slope of the mountain. It now takes about twenty minutes to go up to the monastery by car.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhen the monastery was built, Ban dkar stag phu chos rje Ngag dbang bstan \u0026rsquo;dzing rgya mtsho, who was of the dGe lugs pa school, gave a huge amount of tea, grain and the like, by way of offering congratulations for the completion of the monastery.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHaving fully completed dNgul kho Monastery with excellent buildings and religious objects, sTag zhig Rin dbang summoned all the monks of the Eternal Bon monasteries and hermitages in rGyal shod district to his monastery and performed the \u0026ldquo;medicine rite\u0026rdquo; (\u003cspan xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"\u003esman sgrub\u003c/span\u003e) based on the \u003cspan xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"\u003eKhro bo \u0026rsquo;od zer \u0026rsquo;khyil ba\u003c/span\u003e. This was the first time such a rite, on such a grand scale, was performed in the region. He bestowed upon the participants all the teachings they wished for. Not only that, according to the manner of each monastic community, he continually arranged plentiful offerings and brought back the lost rules of the regular services of dNgul kho Monastery and recruited more monks and lay practitioners than before.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSince this lama himself relied upon those laymen who had taken some vows, he obtained the real nature of power of wisdom and compassion by means of Tantric practices.

A special ordinance was given to the monastery by His Holiness the Thirteenth Dalai Lama, Thub bstan rgya mtsho.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eDuring the time of sTag zhig Rin dbang, dNgul kho dar rgyal gling made progress in deserving its name. Later, around the 1920s, both the lama and his disciple died, one after the other.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSince this monastery was a mixture of old and new Bonpo tradition, the regular prayer services and rituals are also practised accordingly.\u003c/p\u003e \u003ch5 id=\"b5-1-4-4-1\"\u003eMain religious objects\u003c/h5\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe monastery\u0026rsquo;s religious objects, which were in perfect condition, included the following: a bronze statue of Zhi ba Kun bzang a skor; one of Tshe dbang rig \u0026rsquo;dzin, rediscovered in gSa\u0026rsquo; phu by sTag gzhi Rin dbang; a conch of enlightenment that belonged to sTag gzhi Rin dbang; and the three relics of sTag gzhi Tshul khrims called \u003cspan xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"\u003esha\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"\u003eri ram, me ri ram and chu ri ram\u003c/span\u003e, which came out of his brain.
