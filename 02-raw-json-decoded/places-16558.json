The axis of this single cluster of low-elevation buildings runs northwest-southeast and is 36.5 m in length (the length of the spur). The complex is primarily 6 m to 8 m wide (the width of the spur). The edges of the summit are completely revetted. These prominent revetments are 1 m to 3 m in height. In some places along the rim of the rocky summit, fissures are bridged by stone members around 80 cm in length, forming the base of the revetments. Multiple ramparts guarded the main access-way to the castle on the southeast side of the spur. The entire facility was built of variable-sized uncut granite blocks (generally 20 cm to 40 in length) laid in random-rubble courses with ample amounts of mud mortar. Most of this mortar, however, has dissolved from the wall seams. Granite blocks up to 70 cm in length are found in some walls.

There appears to have been two rooms located here but standing walls just 50 cm in height still exist. Immediately to the northwest, at 1 m higher elevation, here is a band of at least five or six rooms stretching across 17.3 m of the summit (3 m to 6.3 m wide here). Only the footings of the partition walls are partly intact. Revetments are up to 1.7 m in height. In the east wall of this group of rooms there are the remains of the main entrance to the citadel. It rises 1.5 m and steps must have once scaled this inlet. About 2 m below the base of the entrance there is a revetted rocky ledge (5 m x 2.5 m x up to 1.9 m). The main access route to the castle appears to have passed via this ledge. This horizontal projection probably functioned as a landing and as a defensive platform if need be. About 6 m lower down there is another revetted ledge (3.5 m x 4.3 m). Approximately 6 m further down is yet another revetted ledge (6 m x 4 m). The walls lining this ledge are 3 m in height, 70 cm of which is freestanding. A stone-filled depression on top of the structure is spanned by a single in situ large stone corbel protruding 50 cm from the parapet wall. This must have been one element in either a floor or roof assembly, the rest of which is no longer extant. Between the lower ledge and the middle ledge above it there are traces of the retaining wall that were constructed around the access route, as well as another revetted ledge (2.5 m x 3 m x 1.2 m) projecting from a rock rib. \u003c/p\u003e \u003ch5 id=\"b1-1-76-4-2\"\u003eCentral summit sector\u003c/h5\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe central summit sector consisted of at least 13 or 14 rooms set at about 2 m higher elevation than the southeast summit sector. These structures are highly fragmentary and their precise ground plan is no longer evident. The width of the central summit sector is around 6 m. The largest single room has a floor space measuring 2.3 m x 3.2 m. One of the rooms (2.7 m x 1.2 m) is situated below an adjoining room. The semi-subterranean aspect of this room and the small size of the rooms in general suggest that the summit complex may have been of an all-stone (\u003cspan class=\"popular emph\"\u003edo khang\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"scholar emph\"\u003erdo khang\u003c/span\u003e) composition. Another room (1.4 m in length) has rounded corners, a trait of all-stone corbelled edifices as well. An entranceway (1.3 m wide) opens to the two east sectors of \u003cspan class=\"popular\"\u003eKolok Khargok\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"scholar\"\u003eKo logs mkhar gog\u003c/span\u003e. Farther south in the central summit complex there appears to have been an entrance accessing the east side of the formation. This was a twin entryway with a dividing wall between the two openings (75 cm and 85 cm wide). \u003c/p\u003e \u003ch5 id=\"b1-1-76-4-3\"\u003eNortheast sector\u003c/h5\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe northeast sector on the east flank of the summit begins about 2.5 m from the summit complex. Several steps must have once led down to the northeast sector (8 m x 6.5 m). It consisted of at least four rooms. The north portion of the northeast sector is better preserved than most other structures at \u003cspan class=\"popular\"\u003eKolok Khargok\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"scholar\"\u003eKo logs mkhar gog\u003c/span\u003e. Standing wall segments up to 2 m in height resting upon 1-m high revetments have survived here. \u003c/p\u003e \u003ch5 id=\"b1-1-76-4-4\"\u003eCentral east sector\u003c/h5\u003e \u003cp\u003eTwo meters lower and at a distance of 4.8 m from the northeast sector there is the central east sector (6.7 m x 3.2 m). The central east sector appears to have consisted of several small rooms built at two distinct elevations. The forward wall (3 m in height, 1.2 m of which is freestanding) of the lower level is punctuated by a small window opening (30 cm x 30 cm) with its lintel (50 cm in length) still in place. Along the upper extent of the rear wall of the lower level there are three large stones that protrude 25 cm outwards to create a plate, which must have helped to support the roof assembly. In the rear wall of the upper level of the central east sector there is a buttress with a massive stone corbel resting upon it. A roof slab (70 cm in length) is also in situ in a corner of an upper room. This structural evidence establishes that at least some (if not most or all) of \u003cspan class=\"popular\"\u003eKolok Khargok\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"scholar\"\u003eKo logs mkhar gog\u003c/span\u003ewas of an all-stone corbelled composition. \u003c/p\u003e \u003ctable cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\" class=\"navarrows\"\u003e \u003ctbody\u003e \u003ctr\u003e \u003ctd class=\"leftcell\"\u003e \u003ca class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"\u003e \u003cimg src=\"/global/images/arrow-left.gif\" title=\"Previous Section\"/\u003e \u003c/a\u003e \u003c/td\u003e \u003ctd class=\"midcell\"\u003e \u003ca class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"\u003e \u003cimg src=\"/global/images/arrow-up.gif\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"/\u003e \u003c/a\u003e \u003c/td\u003e \u003ctd class=\"rightcell\"\u003e \u003ca class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"\u003e \u003cimg src=\"/global/images/arrow-right.gif\" title=\"Next Section\"/\u003e \u003c/a\u003e \u003c/td\u003e \u003c/tr\u003e \u003c/tbody\u003e \u003c/table\u003e \u003c/div\u003e \u003cdiv id=\"chap-id\"\u003e/bellezza/b1-1-76/\u003c/div\u003e \u003cdiv style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\" class=\"jqmWindow\" id=\"chapRefWindow\"\u003e \u003cdiv class=\"closebtn\"\u003e \u003ca href=\"#\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/div\u003e \u003cdiv style=\"height: 280px;\" class=\"conx-content\"\u003e \u003ch3\u003eNote Citation for Page \u003cspan class=\"pgnm\"/\u003e \u003c/h3\u003e \u003cp class=\"biblref\"\u003eJohn Vincent Bellezza, Antiquities of Zhang Zhung: A Comprehensive Inventory of Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Monuments on he Tibetan Upland (Charlottesville, VA 22904:Tibetan \u0026amp; Himalayan Library, 2010), \u003cspan class=\"pgnm\"/\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e \u003ch3\u003eBibliographic Citation\u003c/h3\u003e \u003cp\u003eJohn Vincent Bellezza.
