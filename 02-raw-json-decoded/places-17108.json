Its founder <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Situ Penchen Ch&ouml;kyi Jungn&eacute;</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">si tu pan chen chos kyi byung gnas</span></em>, 1700-1774) was a high-ranking lama in the <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Karma Kagy&uuml;</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">karma bka' brgyud</span></em>) sect, a renowned artist, and important scholar in the fields of literary arts, medicine, and certain <span class=\"topic\" title=\"Type ID here\">Madhyamaka</span> doctrines. For two centuries the monastery maintained high standards in all areas of Tibetan religious education and the secular arts and sciences.</p> <p><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pelpung</span> is located in <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pelpung Township</span>, <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Mensh&ouml;</span>&nbsp;(<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">sman shor</span></em>) District, <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Deg&eacute;</span>&nbsp;County. Relatively speaking, <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pelpung</span> is not an especially old monastery, yet there have been religious establishments on the site for many centuries. In the early thirteenth century a disciple of the founding lama of the <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Drigung Kagy&uuml;</span> ('<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">bri gung bka 'brgyud</span></em>) sect <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Jikten Sumgyi G&ouml;npo</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">'jig rten gsum gyi mgon po</span></em>, 1143-1217) founded a <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Drigung</span> monastery on the spot where over 500 years later <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Situ</span> would build the main temple of <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pelpung</span>. The monastery was called <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pelden Jangchup Ling</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">dpal ldan byang chub gling</span></em>) and was also known as <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pe&rsquo;u Jangchup Ling</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">spe'u byang chub gling</span></em>). The study monks lived near a black-colored cliff, the meditation monks lived on the upper part of the mountain on which the monastery was situated, and an outdoor teaching venue was built at a place that has henceforth been known as Dharma Throne Plain (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">chos khri thang</span></em>).</p> <p>Conflicts - armed, doctrinal, and otherwise - between the <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Drigung</span> and <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Sakya</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">sa skya</span></em>) sects and their respective Mongolian supporters came to a head in 1290 with the sacking of <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Drigung</span> Monastery in Central Tibet. In the aftermath of the <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Sakya</span> victory many <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Drigung</span> monasteries - including those in <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kham</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">khams</span></em>) - were taken over by the <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Sakya</span> ecclesiastical state. <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pelden Jangchup Ling</span> was among the monasteries converted to <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Sakya</span> and for the following few centuries the institution followed <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Sakya</span> liturgies and doctrines. <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Ngari Rapjampa Ts&uuml;ltrim &Ouml;zer</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">mnga' ris rab 'byams pa tshul khrims 'od zer</span></em>) is &nbsp;the primary lama associated with the monastery&rsquo;s conversion to <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Sakya</span> traditions, but little is known about him. At some point after the conversion the establishment was completely destroyed by fire, after which the community was disbanded and the ruins were left to the elements. Unfortunately the precise date of this event is not recorded.</p> <p><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pelpung</span> founder <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Situ Penchen</span> was the eighth in a line of reincarnate lamas dating back to the fifteenth century. The first seven <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Situ</span>s were based at <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Karma</span> Monastery (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">karma dgon</span></em>) in present-day <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Jomda</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">'jo mda'</span></em>) County. The eighth <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Situ</span> was born in <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Deg&eacute;</span> territory and as a condition of his recognition as a high reincarnate lama, the <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Deg&eacute;</span> royal court demanded that when the lama reached his majority that he stay in <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Deg&eacute;</span> and serve the royal family. <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Situ</span> grew up to be a brilliant scholar and able administrator, capable of assisting his sect and the <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Deg&eacute;</span> polity. In 1727 <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Deg&eacute;</span> king <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Tenpa Tsering</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">bstan pa tshe ring</span></em>) ordered <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Situ</span> to build a monastery within the heartland of <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Deg&eacute;</span> territory and on an inspection of potential sites <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Situ</span> settled upon the location where <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pelden Jangchub Ling</span> once stood. Ground was broken in 1728 and it was built with corv&eacute;e labor ordered by the king of <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Deg&eacute;</span>. The main structure took over two years to complete. In 1729 the king and his entourage attended a celebration at <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pelpung</span> for the completion of the foundation, at which time he decreed a monk tax (<span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ts&uuml;ntrel</span>, <em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">btsun khral</span></em>) in order to provide <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pelpung</span> with 500 recruits.</p> <p>Studies flourished at <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pelpung</span> under <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Situ</span> and his disciples. <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Situ</span>&rsquo;s <em><span class=\"tibtext\" title=\"Type ID here\">Autobiography</span> </em>records his multiple teachings to <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Belo Tsewang K&uuml;nkhyap</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">'be lo tshe dbang kun khyab</span></em>) of <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Zurmang</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">zur mang</span></em>), his most famous personal student. In addition to the literary studies that <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Situ</span> imparted to <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Belo</span> and his other disciples, <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Situ</span> was also an avid teacher of the <span class=\"topic\" title=\"Type ID here\">Other-Emptiness</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">gzhan stong</span></em>) doctrine of <span class=\"topic\" title=\"Type ID here\">Madhyamaka</span>. <span class=\"topic\" title=\"Type ID here\">Other-Emptiness</span> has always been controversial and <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Situ</span> favored the <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Jonang</span> (<em><span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">jo nang</span></em>) brand of explanation, which the <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Fifth Dalai Lama</span> had persecuted a century earlier. In 1758 <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Situ</span> sent <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Belo</span> to the far flung <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Jonang</span> stronghold of <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Takten P&uuml;ntsok Ling</span>&nbsp;(<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">rtag brtan&nbsp;phun tshogs gling</span></em>) to receive the reading transmissions for the <em><span class=\"tibtext\" title=\"Type ID here\">Collected Works</span></em> of the <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Jonang</span> author <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Tāranātha</span> 1575-1634).</p> <p>For several generations <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pelpung</span>&rsquo;s seminary (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">bshad grwa</span></em>) was located somewhat behind the lower retreat center. Subsequently, the eleventh <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Situ Pema Wangchok Gyelpo</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">padma dbang mchog rgyal po</span></em>; 1886-1952) moved it to a new location. Two of the luminaries of early twentieth century scholasticism in <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kham</span> taught at <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pelpung</span>: <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Mipam Chokl&eacute; Namgyel</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">mi pham&nbsp;phyogs las&nbsp;rnam rgyal</span></em>, 1846-1912) and <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Khenpo Shenga</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">mkhan po gzhan dga'</span></em>, 1871-1927). Several of <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Mipam</span>&rsquo;s writings were in fact written in fulfillment of requests by the <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pelpung</span> scholar <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Lhaksam Gyeltsen</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">lhag bsam rgyal mtshan</span></em>, d.u.). <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Khenpo Shenga</span> stayed at <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pelpung</span> for longer and left a more significant impact on the scriptural studies at <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pelpung</span>. <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Khenpo Shenga</span> taught at the <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pelpung</span> shedra from ca. 1910-1918, with a return teaching appointment in 1920. Furthermore, he composed many of his commentaries on the so-called thirteen great treatises at <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pelpung</span>, and many of his writings were printed there.</p> <p>It is hard to overstate the degree to which, due to <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Situ</span>&rsquo;s&nbsp;direction and talent, <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pelpung</span> was a leading center of Tibetan painting for all of the premodern period of its history. The best scholarly work on the stylistic and social dimensions of the art history of <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Situ Penchen</span> and <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pelpung</span> Monastery is the catalogue to the 2009 exhibition of <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Situ</span>&rsquo;s&nbsp;artwork, <em><span class=\"tibtext\" title=\"Type ID here\">Patron and Painter: Situ Panchen and the Revival of the Encampment Style</span> </em>by <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">David Jackson</span> and <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Karl Debreczeny</span>. An early codification of <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Situ</span>&rsquo;s&nbsp;medical theories and practical instructions is found in the <em><span class=\"tibtext\" title=\"Type ID here\">Situ&rsquo;s Compendia of Medicine</span></em> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">si tu sman bsdus e waM</span></em>) in two volumes. An important bridge between the pre- and post-Maoist periods of the study and praxis of painting and medicine at <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pelpung</span> was the influential lama <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Tanglha Tsewang</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">thang lha tshe dbang</span></em>; d. ca. 1985)</p> <p><span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pelpung</span> also housed one of the major printing centers in all of <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kham</span>. Among the first works published at <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pelpung</span> was the <em><span class=\"tibtext\" title=\"Type ID here\">Collected Works of Situ Penchen</span></em> soon after his passing in 1774. The full history of the <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pelpung</span> printing house is not yet known but a relatively complete list of works published at <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pelpung</span> through the middle of the twentieth century can be determined on the basis of a large collection of <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pelpung</span> texts housed at the National Library in Beijing. The printing house certainly featured much <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kagy&uuml;</span> religious literature but also a tremendous amount of <span class=\"org\" title=\"Type ID here\">Nyingma</span> treasure literature and ecumenical scholastic writings, in addition to works on medicine and the literary arts. <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kolma&scaron;</span> has determined that the <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pelpung</span> collection contains 3,316 individual titles. The corpus includes the collected works of the eighth and ninth <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Situ</span> lamas (12 volumes total), the eighth and fifteenth <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Karmapas</span> (24 volumes total), the writings of <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kongtr&uuml;l</span>&nbsp;(<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">kong sprul</span></em>) in more than 20 volumes, the first edition of the great collection of revealed treasures called the <em><span class=\"tibtext\" title=\"Type ID here\">Rinchen Terdz&ouml;</span></em> (63 volumes), and numerous volumes of small collections and the writings of late nineteenth and early twentieth century <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pelpung</span> lamas. The printing press and its woodblocks were nearly completely destroyed and have not been restored to any significant degree.</p> <p>The first retreat center at <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pelpung</span> was on the hill high above the monastery. <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Situ Ch&ouml;kyi Jungn&eacute;</span> built it and his younger brother <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">&Ouml;ntr&uuml;l Wanggi Dorj&eacute; </span>(<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">dbon sprul dbang gi rdo rje</span></em>; d.u.) later established the Lower Practice Center (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">sgrub sde 'og ma</span></em>), below the original retreat and closer to the main temple. The tenth <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Situ Pema K&uuml;nzang</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">si tu padma kun bzang</span></em>; 1854-1885) expanded the Lower Practice College. <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kongtr&uuml;l</span> notes in his <em><span class=\"tibtext\" title=\"Type ID here\">Autobiography</span></em>, which was recently translated into English, that the opening of the new retreat center led to the temporary demise of the &ldquo;upper&rdquo; retreat. He writes, &ldquo;At the hermitage, it would seem that at the time of <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Lord Ch&ouml;kyi Jungn&eacute;</span> there had been both a meditation center and retreat huts. However, since the <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">&Ouml;ntrul</span> incarnation <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Wang-gi Dorj&eacute; </span>had later established the lower meditation center, the upper center had been allowed to fall into disrepair as though abandoned, and there was nothing but dilapidated buildings&rdquo; (p. 51). The excerpt above is found in the <em><span class=\"tibtext\" title=\"Type ID here\">Autobiography</span></em> as part of the record of 1842, when <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kongtr&uuml;l</span> was embarking on a three-year retreat for which the contemporaneous <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Situ</span> incarnation had given him permission to build a hermitage on the grounds of the older retreat center. As <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kongtr&uuml;l</span> was embarking on a very strict, long-term retreat he did not set out to rebuild the retreat to its former glory. <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kongtr&uuml;l</span> stayed there in residence for many years.</p> <p>In the late fall and winter of 1860-61 <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kongtr&uuml;l</span> built another - the third - retreat center at <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pelpung</span>. This was located at <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Tsadra Rinchen Drak</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">tsA 'dra rin chen brag</span></em>), Cārita-like Jeweled Cliff, which is less than an hour&rsquo;s walk from the center of <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pelpung</span> and was recognized by <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kongtr&uuml;l</span> in the late 1850s to be one of the major holy places in all of <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kham</span>. Initially <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kongtr&uuml;l</span> built a new temple next to his retreat hut at <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Tsadra</span>, and then soon after decided to build a proper retreat center on the site. <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kongtr&uuml;l</span>&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em><span class=\"tibtext\" title=\"Type ID here\">Autobiography</span> </em>contains many details about the retreat center. After <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kongtr&uuml;l</span>&rsquo;s&nbsp;lama approved of his plans to build a retreat center, he writes in the <em><span class=\"tibtext\" title=\"Type ID here\">Autobiography</span></em>:</p> <p><span class=\"prose\"> </span></p> <p>I went to <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Situ Rinpoch&eacute;</span>&rsquo;s monastic residence to request funds that would ensure that the retreat program could begin that year... [<span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">&Ouml;ntrul</span> (the head of the <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Situ</span> residence)] selected seven people - one to be the retreat master, five to be retreatants, and one to be the lama responsible for the rituals of the protective deities.... When the ritual to avert negativity had been completed, they began their three-year retreat program....&nbsp; It is on this site that, over the years, eight temples of various sizes have been constructed, filled with representations of enlightened form, speech, and mind, and provided with offerings, rooms for lodgings, kitchens, and so forth.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The retreat was consecrated in early 1861 and called Distant Retreat (<span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">Yangtr&ouml;</span>, <em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">yang khrod</span></em>). <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Kongtr&uuml;l</span>&rsquo;s&nbsp;regulations and instructions for the retreatants of the <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Tsadra</span> retreat has been translated into English under the title <em><span class=\"tibtext\" title=\"Type ID here\">Jamgon Kongtrul's Retreat Manual</span></em> (tr. <span class=\"person\" title=\"Type ID here\">Ngawang Zangpo</span>; Snow Lion, 1994)</p> <p>In addition to the seminary and retreat institutions, the central monastery also had a community of monks devoted to the elaborate liturgical calendar and its attendant ritual arts. The overall monastic community was organized in terms of four major regionally based sections, the word for section (&ldquo;<span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">shok</span><em>,&rdquo; <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">shog</span></em>) being the same as that used in nomadic parlance for segment or division of a tribe. By looking at the regions and communities associated with each section one can get a relatively clear idea of the demographics of <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pelpung</span> monastery. The first section was called <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Selo Shok</span>&nbsp;(<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">se lo shog</span></em>) and had members from <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Setsa</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">se tsha</span></em>) and <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Alo</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">a lo</span></em>), and represents the vicinity around <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pelpung</span> itself. The second section at the monastery was called the <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Chidrok</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">phyi 'brog shog</span></em>) and attracted monks from nomadic areas to the west of the <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Drichu</span> (Yangzi) River, whose communities, incidentally, were liable to the taxes of both <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Lhasa</span> and <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Deg&eacute;</span>. The <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Chidrok Shok</span>&rsquo;s monks came from <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Chidrok</span> and <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dzishen</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">'dzi gshan</span></em>). The third section was <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pewar Shok</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">dpe war shog</span></em>). <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pewar</span> lies along the <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Drichu</span> river and includes both sides of the river, with the eastern side being located at the opening of the long valley in which <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pelpung</span> is located much further in the interior. <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pewar Shok</span> was home to monks from <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pewar</span>, <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pekha</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">dpe kha</span></em>), and <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Katok</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">kaHtog</span></em> [though this is likely does not refer to the region around <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Katok</span> Monastery]). <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Lharu Shok </span>(<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">lha ru shog</span></em>), the fourth regionally-based organizational division at <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pelpung</span>, covered monks from the region immediately south of <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pelpung</span>: <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Mensh&ouml;</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">sman shod</span></em>; the valley in which <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dzongsar</span>&nbsp;Monastery is located), <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Dzing Terlhung</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">&lsquo;dzing gter lhung</span></em>), <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Tsamdo</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">rtsam mdo</span></em>), <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Horpo</span> (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">hor po</span></em>), and others. The administrative practices of the <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">shok</span> section system requires further research. A recent history of <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pelpung</span> states that the exact number of residents at <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pelpung</span> for the premodern period is unknown but that there were 3,650 monks affiliated with the monastery.</p> <p>Present-day <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pelpung</span> Monastery is well regarded for its library. The lamas and residents of <span class=\"place\" title=\"Type ID here\">Pelpung</span> were able to safeguard many hundreds of manuscripts and xylograph prints during the Cultural Revolution, including many texts that some thought had been lost for centuries. Fortunately the main assembly hall was not destroyed during the turmoil and traces of ancient murals can still be seen on the walls. The seminary and retreat centers have been rebuilt and are at full capacity.</p>","created_at":"2010-10-11 11:00:37 UTC","updated_at":"2010-11-06 14:57:54 UTC","id":1207,"title":"Pelpung Monastery","is_primary":true}]}
