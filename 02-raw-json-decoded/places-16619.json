Entranceways tend to be relatively large, but there is no evidence for their having been windows in any of the structures. All structures are constructed of blue-gray metamorphic slabs (10 cm to 80 cm in length) configured in heavily mud-mortared random-work courses. Walls average only 40 cm in thickness. Some walls are finely constructed of small slabs (10 cm to 25 cm long). None of the edifices are aligned in the cardinal directions, nor is there structural evidence for hearths.

Further archaeological research is needed, however, to confirm this hypothesis.

This large structure is 22 m long, 3.7 m wide on its southwest side and 7 m wide on its northeast side. There are significant wall elevations (up to 1.8 m) all throughout the structure save for its northeast end. The southwest end of RS1 is only one room wide (rooms 1 to 3). Room 1 has its own independent entrance. Rooms 2 and 3 are internally connected through an entranceway (1.3 m x 1 m) with an intact lintel. The slightly rounded corners of the wall plates in rooms 1 to 3 are a telltale sign that they were capped by an all-stone roof. To the northeast of room 3 the structure widens to two rooms abreast. There appear to have been hree such pairs of rooms but the northeast extremity of the building is almost leveled. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eA \u003cspan class=\"popular emph\"\u003eMani\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"scholar emph\"\u003ema \u0026#7751;i\u003c/span\u003e wall with old inscribed plaques is situated 2.5 m southeast of RS1. Eighteen meters southeast of RS1 there are the remains of a rectangular masonry structure (5.6 m x 1.5 m x 1.5 m).

It supported six rooms. Standing walls reach 1.4 m in height. An entranceway (1 m x 60 cm) between a northeast suite and a southeast suite of rooms is intact. A stone slab (1.2 m x 50 cm) lying inside the structure was probably used in he construction of the roof.\u003c/p\u003e \u003ch5 id=\"b1-2-45-4-3\"\u003eResidential Structure RS3\u003c/h5\u003e \u003cp\u003eResidential structure RS3 (12.7 m x 7 m) is situated 5.5 m northeast or upslope of RS2. Its walls attain a maximum height of 1.6 m. A row of four rooms on the southwest end of the structure may have constituted a separate wing. It could not be determined whether there was a gap of 2 m or interconnecting walls between these four rooms and the rest of the structure. In the southwest group of rooms there is one intact entranceway (1.3 m x 90 cm). The main part of the edifice had no less than ten rooms. The southeast half of the main part of RS3 is in poor condition and its ground plan is no longer apparent. The northeast half of the main portion of RS3, however, is in much better shape. Small bits of the roofing still cling to the corners of its rooms. In the northeast part of the structure, five entranceways with their lintels (up to 1.5 m in length) intact are still in place. Two of these are external entrances on the upslope side of the edifice. All the entranceways of RS3 are 1.2 m to 1.3 m in height and 80 cm to 90 cm in width. In one of walls of a central room there is a small rectangular niche. On the west or upslope side of the main edifice what may have been an apron wall (4.7 m x 1.1 m x 1 m) creates a platform that extends into one of the rooms. \u003c/p\u003e \u003ch5 id=\"b1-2-45-4-4\"\u003eResidential Structure RS4\u003c/h5\u003e \u003cp\u003eResidential structure RS4 (5.5 m x 4.9 m) is located 65 m west of RS3 on a small shelf above the valley floor. It consists of four rooms but only the northeast room (1.9 m x 1.5 m) is in a fairly good state of preservation. The walls of this room reach 1.5 m in height and its integral entranceway is 60 cm wide (opens internally to another room). A few small corbels and roof sheathing (up to 1.4 m in length) remain attached to the north wall of the northeast room. They cover about \u0026frac14; the total area of the room. Against two walls of the northeast room here are small tables consisting of just three stone each. \u003c/p\u003e \u003ch5 id=\"b1-2-45-4-5\"\u003eResidential Structure RS5\u003c/h5\u003e \u003cp\u003eResidential structure RS5 (6 m x 7 m) is situated 6.8 m west of RS4 on the same shelf. This east-facing structure has two tiers of rooms. The west/rear tier probably had three rooms originally.
