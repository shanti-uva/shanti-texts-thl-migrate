The distinguishing feature of reported speech in Tibetan is that it is inserted between the author of the quotation and the verb of speech. When Tibetans read or quote a text, they often conclude the citation with a <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ཟེ་</span> to make it clear that these were not their own words.</p> <p class=\"Paragraph\">Reported speech begins by first mentioning the source and then, where applicable, the intended recipient, respectively in the ergative and dative cases. The quotation is concluded by the sound <span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ཟེ་</span>, which corresponds to closing quotation marks, followed immediately by a verb of speech.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <hr size=\"1\" /> <p><a href=\"#_ftnref1\">[1]</a> These categories are not always relevant. For certain statements there is only one type of discourse, and they may therefore be translated into European languages by either direct or reported speech.
