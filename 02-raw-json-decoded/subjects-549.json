Charlene Makley, in the context of the Labrang cultural region in Gansu Province, suggests a rough equivalence with &ldquo;nomad encampment.&rdquo; However, Fernanda Pirie, who has worked in the Golok cultural region in Sichuan Province, reports that &ldquo;nomad encampments,&rdquo; as smaller residential groupings, are known there as <em>repkor/</em><em>rukor</em> (<em>ru skor</em>); the term <em>dewa</em> is used for larger groups, which are &ldquo;united on the basis of territory, rather than according to a descent ideology&rdquo; (larger groups that according to other authors such as Ekvall or Gelek are also called for instance <em>tsowa</em> or <em>shokwa</em>). Pirie translates <em>dewa</em> as &ldquo;tribal group&rdquo; or &ldquo;tribe&rdquo;; the term <em>dewa</em> is also used to refer to more recently established pastoral townships (Chi. <em>xiang</em>).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Sources:</p> <p>Fernanda Pirie, &ldquo;Violence and Opposition among the Nomads of Amdo: Expectations of Leadership and Religious Authority,&rdquo; in <em>Conflict and Social Order in Tibet and Inner Asia, </em>ed.
