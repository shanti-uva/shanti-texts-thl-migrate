With its sparse grasses, the site sees only limited pastoral use. The enclosure has been nearly obliterated; only scant traces of the east wall are still visible. The east wall is located 9.5 m east of the row of pillars, signaling that this was a medium-sized example of the typology. From what little remains, it appears hat the enclosure was heavily built. There are 16 unhewn pillars forming a modified U-shaped array.</p> <h4 id=\"b2-1-6-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>According to residents of <span class=\"popular\">Tara G&ouml;npa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rta ra dgon pa</span>, brug mo&rsquo;i rdo ring is named for <span class=\"popular\">Drukm&ouml; Lugo</span><span class=\"scholar\">&rsquo;Brug mo&rsquo;i lu mgo</span>, a nearby spring, thought to have been magically created by the goddess <span class=\"popular\">Dr&ouml;lma</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sgrol ma</span>. This sacred spring is said to have appeared after <span class=\"popular\">Drukmo</span><span class=\"scholar\">&rsquo;Brug mo</span>, the wife of <span class=\"popular\">Gesar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ge sar</span>, prayed to <span class=\"popular\">Dr&ouml;lma</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sgrol ma</span> to bring water to the parched landscape. As a result of the spring, a marshy pasture several kilometers in length formed. As part of the boon granted by <span class=\"popular\">Dr&ouml;lma</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sgrol ma</span>, the locale is said to be hydrologically stable. Some <span class=\"popular emph\">drok pa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">&rsquo;brog pa</span> also refer to the site as a <span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span> burial ground (<span class=\"popular emph\">m&ouml;n dur</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mon dur</span>). One elderly <span class=\"popular emph\">drok pa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">&rsquo;brog pa</span> alleges hat the stones of this site were erected by the <span class=\"popular\">Singpa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sing pa</span> (an invader group from the northwest Subcontinent) to honor heir fallen heroes.</p> <h4 id=\"b2-1-6-4\">Site elements</h4> <h5 id=\"b2-1-6-4-1\">Pillars</h5> <p>Most of the standing stones form a meandering north-south row near, what must have been, the west wall of the enclosure. The pillars are all tabular, around 10 cm thick and with some orange climax lichen growing on them. Eleven of them are more than 50 cm in height. In addition to the in situ specimens, there is a dislodged pillar 1 m in length at the site. The broad sides of most pillars face north and south, as is often the case in this ypology. Two pillars planted near, what must have been, the north wall of the enclosure, however, have broad sides oriented east and west. The tallest pillar occupies the central part of the north-south oriented row. It is 1.2 m in height and has a basal girth of 1.7 m. Three other stelae reach 1 m in height and have basal girths of between 1.2 m and 1.4 m. Seven other pillars are between 50 cm and 80 cm in height and have basal girths of between 70 cm and 1.4 m. A number of the pillars have had their tops broken off.</p> <table cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\" class=\"navarrows\"> <tbody> <tr> <td class=\"leftcell\"> <a class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-left.gif\" title=\"Previous Section\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"midcell\"> <a class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-up.gif\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"rightcell\"> <a class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-right.gif\" title=\"Next Section\"/> </a> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div id=\"chap-id\">/bellezza2/b2-1-6/</div> <div style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\" class=\"jqmWindow\" id=\"chapRefWindow\"> <div class=\"closebtn\"> <a href=\"#\">Close</a> </div> <div style=\"height: 280px;\" class=\"conx-content\"> <h3>Note Citation for Page <span class=\"pgnm\"/> </h3> <p class=\"biblref\">John Vincent Bellezza, Antiquities of Zhang Zhung: A Comprehensive Inventory of Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Monuments on he Tibetan Upland (Charlottesville, VA 22904:Tibetan &amp; Himalayan Library, 2010), <span class=\"pgnm\"/>. </p> <h3>Bibliographic Citation</h3> <p>John Vincent Bellezza.
