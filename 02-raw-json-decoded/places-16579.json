These caves were either cut into the gravel and cobble conglomerate formations or existing natural caves modified for occupation. A significant number of the caves had small buildings consisting of one or two anterooms erected in front of them. Some of the caves are no longer accessible due to the shearing and collapse of various parts of the parent material. The majority of caves are between 9 m\u0026sup2; and 20 m\u0026sup2; in floor area. The largest cave recorded measures 5 m x 6 m. Typically there is a large recess or bay in the center of the rear wall, opposite the entrance. Small niches often flank this concavity in the wall. Where there are hearths, hey are often set in front of the rear bay. Many of the caves have arched entranceways cut into the escarpments. The tops of some of these arches terminate in key-hole-like extensions. These pointed upper slots in the entrances are sometimes connected to a groove carved into the ceiling of caves, which functioned to allow smoke to efficiently escape from the interior.

The west room is adjacent to cave P10 (see below). The west room measures 7.8 m (north-south) x 6 m (east- west). On the north side of this room here is a recess in the formation partitioned by a wall into two main parts. This recess (3. 2 m wide x 2.2 m deep x 1.6 m in height) was probably walled off from the rest of the west room. The function of this nook is unknown. In the wall fragments around the mouth of this cavity, a piece of wood was used as a bonding structure between courses of stone. A 10-cm long iron spike protrudes from this piece of wood. Most of the north and east walls of the east room integrate the natural formation in them. The east room has largely collapsed and disappeared down the vertical slopes of the escarpment. Its approximate dimensions are 5 m x 5 m. In the rear of the east room there is cave P11 (3.7 m x 3.3 m x 2. 2 m). The damaged entrance (1 m x 60 cm) o this cave is in an adobe-block fa\u0026ccedil;ade. Some brush is embedded in the wall above the entrance. On the southwest side of the cave there is a mud and stone hearth with a single burner, as well as a berm around its feeding hole to catch ashes. Such hearths are still regularly used in Tibet. This hearth having just a single burner suggests that it did not service many people. The ceiling of P11, like most other caves, is smoke blackened. In the northeast wall of this cave there are three niches. The central niche is mud plastered and its opening is formed by four adobe blocks, which were also plastered and then painted in red ochre. The east niche is also partially plastered. \u003c/p\u003e \u003ch6 class=\"essay\"\u003emkhar rtse middle tier\u003c/h6\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe middle tier is the largest portion of \u003cspan class=\"popular\"\u003eKharts\u0026eacute;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"scholar\"\u003eMkhar rtse\u003c/span\u003e, occupying roughly 70% of its ground plan. On the west side of the middle tier, against the north wall, is cave P12. This cave has an oval plan and measures 2.5 m across. The damaged entrance to the cave is in the east, and its ceiling is about 1.5 m in height. Around the inner walls of P12 there are five rounded niches, the central two of which are situated on top of one another. There was also an anteroom east of the cave (5.6 m x 2 m). East of this anteroom there is an open-air walkway that runs west of the west room of the upper tier, and in between the east and west sections of the middle tier. This walkway then descends below \u003cspan class=\"popular\"\u003eKharts\u0026eacute;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"scholar\"\u003eMkhar rtse\u003c/span\u003e, skirting its south wall. Near the southeast corner of the facility it cuts through the formation, creating a tunnel (4 m x 1.2 m x 1.6 m). In the middle tier, east of the corridor, there are the remains of four small rooms laid out in a north-south row. East of this row of rooms there are two larger rooms extending to the exterior east wall of he facility. In the north of these two east rooms there are three rear caves: P13, P14 and P15. They lie directly below the upper tier east room. The smallest cave, P15, has an independent entrance. P13 is a square cave with several oblong and two large rounded niches. The entrance to P13 (1.5 m x 80 cm) is situated west of P15. P13 has a 1.8-m deep entrance that accesses a cave measuring 3.5 m x 3.5 m. The floor of P13 is heaped high with a vegetal substance that resembles chaff. Village elders state that this came from grain imported from India. The entrance to P14 is found inside P13. The south wall of P14 is composed of an adobe-block and stone fa\u0026ccedil;ade wall. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe south room of the east middle tier has two windows in its south or exterior wall.

Copious amounts of mud-mortar were used in the joints between flat blocks, which are primarily 30 cm to 70 cm in length. This reddish mortar has a high gravel content.

The west entrance opens to an area that has completely collapsed. The lintel of the west entrance is comprised of four timbers, two hewn outer ones and two middle specimens in their natural, uncut form. These timbers are at least 1.5 m in length. The east entrance (1.2 m x 55 cm) has a lintel made up of six timbers, five of which were dressed. The east entrance also has a wooden jamb and sill. It accesses a small room (1.3 m x 2.6 m x 3 m). The ceiling is composed of timbers above which small rounds were used to create tight-knit panels. In the rear of this forward room an entrance (1 m x 60 cm) accesses a second room (2.7 m x 2.4 x 1.8 m) cut into the formation. The function of these two sequestered rooms is not known. In the interior south wall above the lower tier there is a socket-hole in which a floor joist of the middle tier was inserted. An identical socket-hole is found in a high elevation wall fragment in another part of the middle level as well. A single fragment of a round of wood, probably used for the roof, is still among the ruins. \u003c/p\u003e \u003ch6 class=\"essay\"\u003emkhar rtse cave complex \u003c/h6\u003e \u003cp\u003eJust north of the \u003cspan class=\"popular\"\u003eKharts\u0026eacute;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"scholar\"\u003eMkhar rtse\u003c/span\u003e edifice there is a complex of at least ten caves that were hewn into the conglomerate formation. Their regular walls and cut niches and bays indicate the creation of these caves through excavation. A 5.5-m long subterranean passageway divides the caves into two groups (P1 to P7 and P8 to P10). These caves have blackened ceilings, ostensibly from long years of occupation. The floors of most or all of these caves are finished in a mud- and clay-based coating.\u003c/p\u003e \u003ch6 class=\"essay\"\u003eCave P1\u003c/h6\u003e \u003cp\u003e(2.8 m x 2.9 m x 1.7 m)\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThis northern-most cave has an arched west-facing entranceway (1.8 m x 80 cm), and a regular square plan. The interior walls are mud plastered while the ceiling is not. Like most other inhabitable caves in the gu ge region, P1 has various niches and recesses in the walls. The most notable example is found in the northeast wall. This 1.2-m wide, 70-cm deep bay starts 35 cm from the floor and extends to the ceiling. This recess was well finished with plaster and has a base of four graduated tiers.\u003c/p\u003e \u003ch6 class=\"essay\"\u003eCave P2\u003c/h6\u003e \u003cp\u003e(3.3 m x 3 m x 1.8 m)\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eLocated immediately south of P1, this cave also has a west-facing arched entrance. In the east wall of the cave there is a recess with the remains of a wooden lintel. Just above it light-colored coarse hand-woven woolen fabric is embedded in the wall. This fabric appears to be part of the original construction of the cave, serving as a kind of lining. \u003c/p\u003e \u003ch6 class=\"essay\"\u003eCave P3\u003c/h6\u003e \u003cp\u003e(2.3 m 2.3 m)\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eLocated immediately south of P2.

These caves face in he south, east and west directions. Only two of the caves (west-facing) in this sector exhibit freestanding anterooms. One south-facing cave has two chambers with three hearths. In the rear of this cave there is an altar or storage area that was plastered and painted red and yellow.

It must have been brought here by traders and by implication they may have found shelter in this cave. Two of the caves in this group have walls that were painted in red ochre, one of which also has white blotches applied to it. \u003c/p\u003e \u003chr class=\"footnote-divider\"/\u003e \u003ch2\u003eNotes\u003c/h2\u003e \u003cdiv class=\"footnote\"\u003e \u003ca name=\"n77\"/\u003e \u003ca href=\"#nb77\" class=\"note\"\u003e [77] \u003c/a\u003e Bellezza, \u003cem\u003eAntiquities of Upper Tibet\u003c/em\u003e. \u003c/div\u003e \u003ctable cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\" class=\"navarrows\"\u003e \u003ctbody\u003e \u003ctr\u003e \u003ctd class=\"leftcell\"\u003e \u003ca class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"\u003e \u003cimg src=\"/global/images/arrow-left.gif\" title=\"Previous Section\"/\u003e \u003c/a\u003e \u003c/td\u003e \u003ctd class=\"midcell\"\u003e \u003ca class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"\u003e \u003cimg src=\"/global/images/arrow-up.gif\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"/\u003e \u003c/a\u003e \u003c/td\u003e \u003ctd class=\"rightcell\"\u003e \u003ca class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"\u003e \u003cimg src=\"/global/images/arrow-right.gif\" title=\"Next Section\"/\u003e \u003c/a\u003e \u003c/td\u003e \u003c/tr\u003e \u003c/tbody\u003e \u003c/table\u003e \u003c/div\u003e \u003cdiv id=\"chap-id\"\u003e/bellezza/b1-2-4/\u003c/div\u003e \u003cdiv style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\" class=\"jqmWindow\" id=\"chapRefWindow\"\u003e \u003cdiv class=\"closebtn\"\u003e \u003ca href=\"#\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/div\u003e \u003cdiv style=\"height: 280px;\" class=\"conx-content\"\u003e \u003ch3\u003eNote Citation for Page \u003cspan class=\"pgnm\"/\u003e \u003c/h3\u003e \u003cp class=\"biblref\"\u003eJohn Vincent Bellezza, Antiquities of Zhang Zhung: A Comprehensive Inventory of Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Monuments on he Tibetan Upland (Charlottesville, VA 22904:Tibetan \u0026amp; Himalayan Library, 2010), \u003cspan class=\"pgnm\"/\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e \u003ch3\u003eBibliographic Citation\u003c/h3\u003e \u003cp\u003eJohn Vincent Bellezza.
