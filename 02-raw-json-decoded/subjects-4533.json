This system was created originally in Central Tibet by the Mongols in the thirteenth century to facilitate their Yuan Dynasty rule over the region in conjunction with their Sakya clan/monastery partners. In 1268 they reorganized small agricultural estates in Central Tibet based on the unit of a household (\u003cem\u003ehor dud)\u003c/em\u003e, which are in turn organized into every larger administrative units based mostly upon the decimal system. While the units in question are based upon numerical values, the system was an ideal type with the actual census figure varying wildly:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cul\u003e \u003cli\u003e50\u003cem\u003e \u003c/em\u003ehouseholds (\u003cem\u003ehor dud, hord\u0026uuml;\u003c/em\u003e) = 1 horse-head unit (\u003cem\u003erta mgo)\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003e2 horse-head units = 1 century (\u003cem\u003ebrgya skor\u003c/em\u003e, 100 fold unit)\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003e10 centuries = 1 chiliarchy (\u003cem\u003estong skor\u003c/em\u003e, 1,000 fold unit)\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003e10 chiliarchies = 1 myriarchy (\u003cem\u003ekhri skor\u003c/em\u003e, 10,000 fold unit)\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003e10 myriarchies (\u003cem\u003ekhri skor, trikor\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e)\u003c/em\u003e = 1 circuits (\u003cem\u003echol kha\u003c/em\u003e or \u003cem\u003eklu\u003c/em\u003e in Tibetan, the latter a phonetic transcription of the Chinese \u003cem\u003elu\u003c/em\u003e; Mongolian colge)\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003e10 circuits = 1 province \u003cem\u003e(zin\u003c/em\u003e, a phonetic transcription of the Chinese \u003cem\u003esheng\u003c/em\u003e)\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e \u003c/ul\u003e \u003cp\u003eIt is generally said that Tibet had three \"circuits\", but in fact the number of myriarchies is given as thirteen, though in practice there seem to be more than thirteen referred to in historical sources. The three circuits were \u0026Uuml; (dbus), Tsang (gtsang), and Ngari (mnga' ris skor gsum). While this was in fact an insufficient number of circuits to form \"province\", Petech says that \"out of respect for the religious character of the country, the emperor Qubilai decreed that Tibet was to be considered as one [province]\". Later Tibetans misunderstood these three circuits as Utsang (\u003cem\u003edbus gtsang\u003c/em\u003e), Kham (\u003cem\u003ekhams\u003c/em\u003e), and Amdo (\u003cem\u003ea mdo\u003c/em\u003e) respectively.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe formal system must have ended in 1354 with the end of the Sakya hegemony in Tibet, but in fact the myriarchies continued to function as principalities well past then. Thus,\u0026nbsp; the various political periods in Central Tibet following 1354 are named after whichever one of them temporarily went into the ascendancy to become functionally a kingdom dominating its former peers.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe best source on this system in Tibet is without doubt the Sorenson-Hazod-Gyalbo study cited below.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003ePer Sorenson and Guntram Hazod with Tsering Gyalbo (2007). \u003cem\u003eRulers on the Celestial Plain Ecclesiastic and Secular Hegemony in Medieval Tibet: A Study of Tshal Gung-thang\u003c/em\u003e.
