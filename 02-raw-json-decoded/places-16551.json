A descent of several meters along a narrow approach is required to reach the castle, leaving potential intruders vulnerable to attack. A curtain-wall that spanned the distance between the two complexes served as an important defensive feature, which was designed to restrict access to the site.

This represents about one-third of its original length. This defensive wall is as much as 3.5 m in height, and is set 5 m to 10 m below the two summits of the fortress. This structure has a combination of rammed-earth, adobe block and cobble-wall fabrics. \u003c/p\u003e \u003ch5 id=\"b1-1-69-4-2\"\u003eSouthwest complex\u003c/h5\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe southwest complex (48 m x 24 m) is comprised of a dense array of ruined buildings, in keeping with a complex ground plan. In total, there were at least 60 rooms constructed here. Most walls in the southwest complex are made from adobe blocks and attain a maximum elevation of 4 m. Some of these adobe walls have course of cobbles integrated into them.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAccess to the southwest complex is by way of a small hole that was cut into the north face of the summit. This access point was created after the collapse of the original route to the installation. The hole is conveyed to a cave within the citadel. Inside the southwest complex the north side of the formation has cobble wall fragments with intervening courses of sandstone slabs, up to 3 m in height, embedded in it. Certain walls also have sandstone-slab bases. Some structures were hewn into the top of the summit along the south side of the complex o create a semi-subterranean network of rooms. They are, however, in very poor condition. The adobe blocks used in the construction of the various buildings were of a standard size: 40 cm x 20 cm x 10 cm. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOn the south side of the summit, facing east, there is a line of three caves. The north cave (3.4 m x 1.9 m) has three recesses in the rear, the largest of which is 1.3 m deep and 1 m high. Like other caves and subterranean passageways at \u003cspan class=\"popular\"\u003eSharlang\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"scholar\"\u003eShar lang\u003c/span\u003e, this cave has an approximately 2-m tall ceiling. The south cave (5.3 m x 2.8 m) has a deep arched recess in the rear wall and one recess in a side wall. There are also several niches in the walls. The middle cave (3.4 m x 1.9 m) also has a large recess in the rear.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThere are also caves in the north portion of the summit. In some places their roofs have collapsed, leaving gaping holes in the summit. The largest cave in the north of the complex (3.3 m x 3 m) has a 1.6-m deep bay in he rear wall. In the right wall there is a niche (1 m x 1.3 m) partly enclosed by a masonry wall. Also on the right wall of this cave there is a mud and stone closet (1 m x 55 cm x 1 m) with two openings in its base. The function of these appointments is not readily apparent. The largest cave in the north of the complex is connected to the summit by a 2.8-m long passageway. The exterior entrance of this passageway has an in situ stone lintel and sill. The ceiling of the passageway is lined with stones, which in design is not unlike that of an all-stone corbelled roof. Moreover, parts of its two walls are lined in cobble masonry. On the right side of he passageway there is a 1-m deep recess below the floor level. In a nearby cave (4.4 m x 3.3 m) there are two 1.6-m deep bays cut into the rear wall. Beside the bays there is a mud-plastered masonry wall creating an enclosed space (1 m x 90 cm x 70 cm).\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThere is an axial corridor along the south portion of the summit. Also on the south portion of the summit, an adobe-block wall has a stone lintel over an entranceway (1.4 m x 70 cm). Another constructional feature of the southwest complex is walls made of cobbles and sandstone slabs embedded into a light-colored clay and mud matrix. A 6-m high fragment of this unusual wall type is also found in the north portion of the complex. Another salient architectonic trait is the presence of a window (35 cm x 30 cm) in one wall. \u003c/p\u003e \u003ch5 id=\"b1-1-69-4-3\"\u003eNortheast complex\u003c/h5\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe northeast complex (22 m x 18 m) contains a much smaller group of dilapidated buildings than the southwest complex. On the east side of the north portion of the southwest complex there is a tunnel. This is a tunnel (15 m long, 1.5 m wide, 3 m high) that drops down 5 m to a ledge situated below the curtain-wall that joins the two complexes of \u003cspan class=\"popular\"\u003eSharlang Khar\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"scholar\"\u003eShar lang mkhar\u003c/span\u003e. This ledge runs for 22 m between the two complexes. On the north end of this ledge, a 15-m long tunnel winds its way up to he summit of the northeast complex. The remains of a series of steps cut into this tunnel ascend for about 10 m o the south side of the northeast complex. Near the top of the tunnel are three interconnected cave rooms. These caves have the characteristic arched recesses and oblong niches, as well as a natural band of red clay around the base of the walls. There are also several other caves near the head of the tunnel but these have been largely destroyed.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe northeast complex consists of a contiguous cluster of buildings. On the south end of the complex there are he remains of rooms created by excavating the top of the summit. The large rammed-earth structure on the crown of the summit (6 m x 6 m) has wall segments that probably reach 8 m in height. These walls have small square orifices lined with blocks and slabs, which were used to accommodate shuttering pins during construction. In the north wall of this rammed-earth structure there are two triangular loopholes. On the north end of the northeast complex there are two caves, which face east towards the \u003cspan class=\"popular\"\u003eSharlang\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"scholar\"\u003eShar lang\u003c/span\u003e valley. \u003c/p\u003e \u003ctable cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\" class=\"navarrows\"\u003e \u003ctbody\u003e \u003ctr\u003e \u003ctd class=\"leftcell\"\u003e \u003ca class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"\u003e \u003cimg src=\"/global/images/arrow-left.gif\" title=\"Previous Section\"/\u003e \u003c/a\u003e \u003c/td\u003e \u003ctd class=\"midcell\"\u003e \u003ca class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"\u003e \u003cimg src=\"/global/images/arrow-up.gif\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"/\u003e \u003c/a\u003e \u003c/td\u003e \u003ctd class=\"rightcell\"\u003e \u003ca class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"\u003e \u003cimg src=\"/global/images/arrow-right.gif\" title=\"Next Section\"/\u003e \u003c/a\u003e \u003c/td\u003e \u003c/tr\u003e \u003c/tbody\u003e \u003c/table\u003e \u003c/div\u003e \u003cdiv id=\"chap-id\"\u003e/bellezza/b1-1-69/\u003c/div\u003e \u003cdiv style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\" class=\"jqmWindow\" id=\"chapRefWindow\"\u003e \u003cdiv class=\"closebtn\"\u003e \u003ca href=\"#\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/div\u003e \u003cdiv style=\"height: 280px;\" class=\"conx-content\"\u003e \u003ch3\u003eNote Citation for Page \u003cspan class=\"pgnm\"/\u003e \u003c/h3\u003e \u003cp class=\"biblref\"\u003eJohn Vincent Bellezza, Antiquities of Zhang Zhung: A Comprehensive Inventory of Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Monuments on he Tibetan Upland (Charlottesville, VA 22904:Tibetan \u0026amp; Himalayan Library, 2010), \u003cspan class=\"pgnm\"/\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e \u003ch3\u003eBibliographic Citation\u003c/h3\u003e \u003cp\u003eJohn Vincent Bellezza.
