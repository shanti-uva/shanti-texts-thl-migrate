In a sandy plain, just south of the main road running between <span class=\"popular\">Gerts&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sger rtse</span> and shwa kha, are the remains of a number of large single-course quadrate enclosures. Sadly, since circa 2000, the site has been decimated by local residents intent on extracting stones for local building projects. The plain of <span class=\"popular\">Jaorkhok</span><span class=\"scholar\">&rsquo;Byor khog</span> has few naturally occurring stones and easy access to the site has made it highly vulnerable to those <span class=\"popular emph\">drok pa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">&rsquo;brog pa</span> families expanding their homesteads in the area. At the time of the survey, many of he uprooted stones still lay on the site, ready for pickup. Little or no excavation seems to have taken place within the enclosures. </p> <h4 id=\"b2-2-11-3\">Oral tradition </h4> <p>Local residents associate <span class=\"popular\">Jaorkhok</span><span class=\"scholar\">&rsquo;Byor khog</span> with the ancient <span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span>. Its ostensible name suggests hat it is traditionally perceived as being very inauspicious.</p> <h4 id=\"b2-2-11-4\">Site elements</h4> <p>The dimensions, locations and characteristics of the superstructures are as follows:</p> <ol> <li>Funerary structure FS1 (12 m across) has only small wall fragments that remain in situ (32&deg; 25.825&#900; N. lat. / 83&deg; 12.624&#900; E. long. / 4460 m). Two dislodged stones at the enclosure are 1.5 m and 1.2 m in length.</li> <li>Funerary structure FS2 (11 m across) is situated 47 m south of FS1. FS2 was recently damaged and very little remains intact.</li> <li>Funerary structure FS3 is located immediately south of FS2. Three walls of this square enclosure are still partly intact. Aligned in the cardinal directions, FS3 measures 5.7 m (east-west) x 5.3 m (north-south). The variable-length (up to 85 cm long) stones of the walls are elevated 10 cm to 15 cm above ground level.</li> <li>Funerary structure FS 4 was a smaller enclosure of which little still remains (25.710&#900; / 12.594&#900; / 4460 m). It was recently shorn of stones. </li> <li>Funerary structures FS5, FS5, FS6, and FS7 formed a row 60 m in length (25.350&#900; / 13.039&#900; / 4470 m). Every single stone in these structures has been wrenched from the ground. These enclosures were composed of many larger stones (50 cm to 70 cm long). There are traces of other funerary superstructures of the same typology in he proximity. </li> </ol> <p>A rectangular enclosure (6.3 m x 3.7 m) on the south side of <span class=\"popular\">Oma Tso</span><span class=\"scholar\">&rsquo;O ma mtsho</span> was built on level sandy ground (26.381&#900; 10.526&#900; / 4460 m). More than 50 percent of stones in the enclosing walls were recently removed. In situ stones reach a maximum length of 70 cm and project as much as 30 cm above ground level. There is also reported to be a similar enclosure on the north side of <span class=\"popular\">Oma Tso</span><span class=\"scholar\">&rsquo;O ma mtsho</span> at a locale called <span class=\"popular\">Lorpuk</span><span class=\"scholar\">Lor phug</span> (sp.?).</p> <table cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\" class=\"navarrows\"> <tbody> <tr> <td class=\"leftcell\"> <a class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-left.gif\" title=\"Previous Section\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"midcell\"> <a class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-up.gif\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"rightcell\"> <a class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-right.gif\" title=\"Next Section\"/> </a> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div id=\"chap-id\">/bellezza2/b2-2-11/</div> <div style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\" class=\"jqmWindow\" id=\"chapRefWindow\"> <div class=\"closebtn\"> <a href=\"#\">Close</a> </div> <div style=\"height: 280px;\" class=\"conx-content\"> <h3>Note Citation for Page <span class=\"pgnm\"/> </h3> <p class=\"biblref\">John Vincent Bellezza, Antiquities of Zhang Zhung: A Comprehensive Inventory of Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Monuments on he Tibetan Upland (Charlottesville, VA 22904:Tibetan &amp; Himalayan Library, 2010), <span class=\"pgnm\"/>. </p> <h3>Bibliographic Citation</h3> <p>John Vincent Bellezza.
