The headwaters of the <span class=\"popular\">To Chu</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mtho chu</span> valley form a closed amphitheatre with a spring and marsh with the <span class=\"popular\">Tsen La</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rtsan la</span> (sp.?) pass above the site. The nine all-stone residential structures of phug dgu chu gsum are all more or less aligned in the cardinal directions and face in a southerly direction. This probable ancient religious site is extremely remote and seldom visited; although at one time it may have housed more that 50 residents. The <span class=\"popular emph\">do khang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rdo khang</span>, while not well preserved, were superbly constructed from red stone. The rooms were generally small (around 4 m&sup2;) as is typical in all-stone corbelled edifices. The robustly constructed random-rubble slab walls are approximately 50 cm thick. A dark-colored rock of variable-length (up to 1 m long) was used in construction. Corbels and bridging stones up to 1.5 m in length are scattered all around the site. </p> <h4 id=\"b1-2-17-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p> phug dgu chu gsum is reported by local residents to be an ancient religious center.</p> <h4 id=\"b1-2-17-4\">Site elements</h4> <h5 id=\"b1-2-17-4-1\">rDo khang complex</h5> <p> <span class=\"popular emph\">do khang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rdo khang</span> RS1 and RS2 are situated at the bottom end of he site. Residential structures RS3, RS4 and RS5 are set approximately 5 m higher up on broad slopes. At 5 m more elevation are residential structures RS6 and RS7, the third level structures. Residential structure RS8, he fourth level structure, and residential structure RS9, the fifth level structure, were established some meters higher. </p> <h6 class=\"essay\">Residential Structure RS1</h6> <p>Residential structure RS1 measures 14 m (east-west) x 4.4 m (north-south). The east half of the <span class=\"popular emph\">do khang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rdo khang</span> has been felled to its foundations. Near the east wall a tabular stone is planted in the ground. This <span class=\"popular emph\">Doring</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rdo ring</span> was broken and is now only 45 cm in height (basal girth of 1.1 m). Perhaps the standing stone marked the establishment of the building, like at certain Lamaist sites. On the eastern half of the rear/north wall a large corbel protrudes 70 cm over the internal space. The rear wall was set 1 m to 1.2 m into the slope. A partition wall with a maximum height of 1.2 m divides the east and west halves of RS1. There is a small niche in the west side of the partition wall. In the west half of the structure there is a north-south oriented partition wall remnant. </p> <h6 class=\"essay\">Residential Structure RS2</h6> <p>Residential structure RS2 is located 16 m east of RS1. This large structure measures 17 m (east-west) x 7 m (north-south). On the west end of the ruin there is both a forward and rear room. In the west wall of this forward or south room there is a niche, and there is a niche in the rear wall of the rear west room as well. In the rear west room and the adjacent rear room there are corbels and bridging stones clinging to the rear wall. The portion of the outer rear wall in this area is built 1.6 m into the ground. The entranceway between hese two rear rooms is intact (1.2 m x 50 cm). East of these two rear rooms, the rear tier of the <span class=\"popular emph\">do khang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rdo khang </span>appears to have been comprised of one relatively large room. The east section of the rear wall is not so well preserved and extends 1 m or less into the slope. Adjacent to the forward west room there is another forward room that has collapsed. Among the detritus of this room are sheathing slabs up to 2 m in length. East of this collapsed room there is another forward room with an intact entranceway (1.1 m x 80 cm). At 1.8 m, its north wall is the highest remaining fragment at RS2. Farther east only exterior wall traces have endured in the forward part of the edifice. </p> <h6 class=\"essay\">Residential Structure RS3</h6> <p>Residential structure RS3 is located 13 m north of RS2. This poorly preserved structure measures 8 m (east-west) x 4 m (north-south). The northwest corner of the <span class=\"popular emph\">do khang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rdo khang</span> constitutes its most undamaged portion and was built 1.1 m into the slope. In the north/rear wall near the west corner of RS3 there are two niches, one on top of the other. </p> <h6 class=\"essay\">Residential Structure RS4</h6> <p>Residential structure RS4 is situated 6 m northwest and slightly upslope of RS3. It measures 11 m (east-west) x 6.5 m (north-south). This structure has been mostly flattened to its foundations. Wall segments to 1 m in height exist near the southwest corner. There is a small niche in the west wall of RS4.</p> <h6 class=\"essay\">Residential Structure RS5</h6> <p>Residential structure RS5 is located 8 m west of RS4. Its dimensions are 14 m (east-west) x 5 m (north-south). Only external wall fragments up to 1 m in height have survived in this highly deteriorated structure.</p> <h6 class=\"essay\">Residential Structure RS6</h6> <p>Residential structure RS6 is situated 11.5 m north of RS5. The main portion of the building measures 6.3 m (east-west) x 3.5 m (north-south). There is also a lower/south (3.6 m x 2.8 m) extension containing one room centered in front of the main structure. The main structure is partitioned into three rooms. The east entrance opens to a vestibule that extended to the rear east room. The rear east room boasts a few in situ roof slabs. The rear and side walls of the <span class=\"popular emph\">do khang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rdo khang</span> are partially intact. The rear or north wall of RS6 is set 1.3 m into the ground and the side walls reach 1.2 m in height. In the outer west wall there is a small niche. </p> <h6 class=\"essay\">Residential Structure RS7</h6> <p>Residential structure RS7 is found 24 m east of RS6. This smaller structure measures 6.2 m (east-west) x 4.9 m (north-south). The rear wall was built into the slope to a maximum depth of 1.5 m. In the largely whole rear wall, near the west corner, there is a small niche. The south or forward wall of RS7 stands to a height of 50 cm. The room partitions have been mostly destroyed. </p> <h6 class=\"essay\">Residential Structure RS8</h6> <p>Residential structure RS8 was established 17.5 m northwest of RS7 and 9.5 m north of RS6. This <span class=\"popular emph\">do khang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rdo khang</span> measures 15 m (east-west) x 6 m (north-south). Most exterior walls now attain a height of 1 m or less; only the central portion of the forward wall is taller (1.4 m). In the southeast corner of the structure there is a partly integral room. About half of the rear wall of RS8 has survived. </p> <h6 class=\"essay\">Residential Structure RS9</h6> <p>Residential structure RS9 measures 8.4 m (east-west) x 5 m (north-south). The east side of this building has been razed to the ground. On the west of the structure, side wall segments up to 1.3 m in height have persisted. Both a forward room and rear room are discernable in RS9. </p> <h5 id=\"b1-2-17-4-2\"> Buddhist shrine</h5> <p>Some 48 m south of the <span class=\"popular emph\">do khang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rdo khang</span> complex, across the valley divide, there is a neglected Buddhist shrine complex, consisting of the base of a <span class=\"popular emph\">Ch&ouml;rten</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mchod rten</span> or <span class=\"popular emph\">tenkhar</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rten mkhar</span> class shrine connected to walls that run north-south. This masonry base (3 m x 3.2 m) is best preserved on the west side where it is 1.4 m in height. Straight walls rise above a broader 40 cm high basal section. There is no evidence of a <span class=\"popular emph\">bhumpa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">bum pa</span> or any other kind of superstructure. It was constructed of dark bluish slabs that have weathered to a red color, 20 cm o 60 cm in length and 2 cm to 8 cm in thickness. These stones were laid in random-work, dry-mortar courses. On he south side of this cubic structure there is a wall 9 m in length, which has been reduced to 50 cm in height. This wall appears to have been originally around 1 m thick. Another wall links the big shrine to a smaller shrine situated 8 m to the north. This linking wall has been almost obliterated and the smaller shrine is very poorly preserved. The inscribed plaques found at the site are all highly eroded and feature the <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma &#7751;i</span> mantra. </p> <p>A 1-m high plaque partially submerged in the soil sits in the shrine complex. This plaque features a standing <span class=\"popular\">Chenrezik</span><span class=\"scholar\">Spyan ras gzigs</span> (Avalokite&#347;vara) figure adeptly carved in shallow relief. It appears to date to the period of the second Buddhist diffusion (<span class=\"popular emph\">tenpa chidar</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">bstan pa phyi dar</span>). This highly worn relief plaque of Tibet&rsquo;s patron deity documents the Buddhist occupation of phug dgu chu gsum as early as one millennium ago. The implication of this Buddhist artifact may be that the residential facility, after first being established by archaic religious practitioners, was reoccupied by the Buddhists. This reoccupation was probably nominal given the extreme elevation of the site. Moreover, no fixed Buddhist emblems are found near the <span class=\"popular emph\">do khang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rdo khang</span>.</p> <p>The <span class=\"popular\">Chenrezik</span><span class=\"scholar\">Spyan ras gzigs</span> bas relief image is ornamented with two necklaces, earrings and a five-diadem crown. The figure is attired in an Indian style skirt and holds the stem of a lotus in each hand. Below the deity, a butter lamp (<span class=\"popular emph\">Marm&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mar me</span>) and sacrificial cake (<span class=\"popular emph\">Torma</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">gtor ma</span>) were carved and lower on the plaque, swirling lines represent the world ocean. Above he deity&rsquo;s head the sun is on the right side and the moon on the left side. Also, on the left side of the deity, a vertically oriented inscription reads: <span class=\"popular emph\">jo bo ti zang po la na mo</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">jo bo ti bzang po la na mo</span>, and on its right side there is the inscription: <span class=\"popular emph\">Om A Hum</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">o&#7747; a hum</span>. <span class=\"popular\">Jowoti Zangpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Jo bo ti bzang po</span> is an old Upper Tibetan manifestation of spyan ras gzings. </p> <table cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\" class=\"navarrows\"> <tbody> <tr> <td class=\"leftcell\"> <a class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-left.gif\" title=\"Previous Section\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"midcell\"> <a class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-up.gif\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"rightcell\"> <a class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-right.gif\" title=\"Next Section\"/> </a> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div id=\"chap-id\">/bellezza/b1-2-17/</div> <div style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\" class=\"jqmWindow\" id=\"chapRefWindow\"> <div class=\"closebtn\"> <a href=\"#\">Close</a> </div> <div style=\"height: 280px;\" class=\"conx-content\"> <h3>Note Citation for Page <span class=\"pgnm\"/> </h3> <p class=\"biblref\">John Vincent Bellezza, Antiquities of Zhang Zhung: A Comprehensive Inventory of Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Monuments on he Tibetan Upland (Charlottesville, VA 22904:Tibetan &amp; Himalayan Library, 2010), <span class=\"pgnm\"/>. </p> <h3>Bibliographic Citation</h3> <p>John Vincent Bellezza.
