The location of his facility deep inside a gorge is possibly best explained by the existence of a route across the <span class=\"popular\">Langchen Tsangpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Glang chen gtsang po</span> from below this point. This facility could have monitored or controlled the river crossing, helping to regulate trade in the region. The site consists of a single fairly well aligned building (9.5 m x 9.3 m) that straddles a narrow ridge-top. This structure has an open ground plan with no partition walls visible. Exterior wall elevations reach 1.6 m and interior wall elevations 1 m in height. Walls are composed of random-rubble texture, and are 35 cm to 45 cm in hickness. Brown sandstone and to a lesser degree, bluish limestone, was employed in construction. Stones are generally 10 cm to 30 cm in length with the longest specimens reaching 50 cm.</p> <h4 id=\"b1-1-73-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>According to villagers in snu, kol mkhar is named for the <span class=\"popular\">Kolw&eacute; Lama</span><span class=\"scholar\">Kol ba&rsquo;i bla ma</span> (sp.?). He was so called due to the <span class=\"popular\">Kol</span><span class=\"scholar\">Kol</span> mediation cave located at a somewhat lower elevation. <span class=\"popular\">Kolw&eacute; Lama</span><span class=\"scholar\">Kol ba&rsquo;i bla ma</span> is said to have meditated here sometime in the past.</p> <h4 id=\"b1-1-73-4\">Site elements</h4> <h5 id=\"b1-1-73-4-1\">Castle</h5> <p>The entrance is nestled in an inlet on the east side of the edifice. This indenture is composed of two walls hat project 1.6 m from the main body of the building. This architectural feature is reminiscent of the entranceways found in <span class=\"popular\">Ha La Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ha la mkhar</span>West (A-58) and <span class=\"popular\">Naktsuk Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Nag gtsug mkhar</span> (A-57). The entryway walls are as much as 2.3 m high on their exterior sides. Set 1.7 m apart, the enclosed space between he entryway walls rises 1 m to the floor level of the stronghold. This rise must have been ascended by a stairway but nothing of it remains. The original route up the steep east slope to the facility has also been obliterated. Access to the facility is now from the north along the ridge-top. Some stones in the walls of the stronghold were set both vertically and horizontally to create an alternating texture. On the same summit, 17.5 m to the south, there is a single poorly preserved 4 m long wall fragment at ground level.</p> <h4 id=\"b1-1-73-5\">Affiliated sites</h4> <h5 id=\"b1-1-73-5-1\">rDo rje gling</h5> <p>In the <span class=\"popular\">Rongchung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rong chung</span> region of <span class=\"popular\">Tiyak</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ti yag</span> township there is a site called <span class=\"popular\">Dorj&eacute; Ling</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo rje gling</span>, which is said to have been a fortress before being converted into a monastery. According to local sources, this monastery was destroyed long ago.<a class=\"note\" name=\"nb58\" href=\"#n58\">58</a> <span class=\"popular\">Dorj&eacute; Ling</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo rje gling</span> is found on steep slopes on he opposite side of the valley from <span class=\"popular\">Maryang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mar g.yang</span> village, at 3500 m. It occupies a strategic position in the valley. The site covers an area of approximately 60 m x 20 m. Walls are of the rammed-earth and limestone block types. A number of ruined Buddhist buildings are found on the site as well as a <span class=\"popular\">Riksum G&ouml;npo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rigs gsum mgon po</span> shrine. This shrine, situated at he highest point of the site, was founded on an old revetment. If indeed a fortress was once situated at <span class=\"popular\">Dorj&eacute; Ling</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo rje gling</span>, this substantial foundation structure is likely to have belonged to it.</p> <hr class=\"footnote-divider\" /> <h2>Notes</h2> <div class=\"footnote\"><a name=\"n58\"></a> <a class=\"note\" href=\"#nb58\"> [58] </a> According to <span class=\"popular\">Guge Tsering Gyelpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ge tshe ring rgyal po</span>, the <span class=\"popular\">Dorj&eacute; Ling</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo rje gling</span> fortress was occupied by a famous local headman (<span class=\"popular emph\">p&ouml;npo</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">dpon po</span>) during the time of the <span class=\"popular\">Gug&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ge</span> kings (<span class=\"popular\">Guge Tsering Gyelpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ge tshe ring rgyal po</span>, <span class=\"popular emph\">nga ri ch&ouml; jung</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">Mnga&rsquo; ris chos &rsquo;byung</span>, 286).</div> <table class=\"navarrows\" cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\"> <tbody> <tr> <td class=\"leftcell\"><a class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"> <img title=\"Previous Section\" src=\"../../../../../global/images/arrow-left.gif\" alt=\"\" /> </a></td> <td class=\"midcell\"><a class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"> <img title=\"Beginning of Article\" src=\"../../../../../global/images/arrow-up.gif\" alt=\"\" /> </a></td> <td class=\"rightcell\"><a class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"> <img title=\"Next Section\" src=\"../../../../../global/images/arrow-right.gif\" alt=\"\" /> </a></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div id=\"chap-id\">/bellezza/b1-1-73/</div> <div id=\"chapRefWindow\" class=\"jqmWindow\" style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\"> <div class=\"closebtn\"><a href=\"#\">Close</a></div> <div class=\"conx-content\" style=\"height: 280px;\"> <h3>Note Citation for Page <span class=\"pgnm\"> </span></h3> <p class=\"biblref\">John Vincent Bellezza, Antiquities of Zhang Zhung: A Comprehensive Inventory of Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Monuments on he Tibetan Upland (Charlottesville, VA 22904:Tibetan &amp; Himalayan Library, 2010), <span class=\"pgnm\">. </span></p> <h3>Bibliographic Citation</h3> <p>John Vincent Bellezza.
