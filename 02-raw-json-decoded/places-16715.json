The view to the west is the most open at the site, but the southern and eastern vistas are also encompassing. The well-drained terrain is broad, level, sandy, and with some grasses. A small stream flows very close to the south and west flanks of <span class=\"popular\">Nyungkar Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Nyung dkar rdo ring</span>. The site consists of a small example of a single pillar erected inside a rectangular enclosure. It is very unusual to find this type of monument so close to running water. </p> <h4 id=\"b2-1-73-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>According to an elderly <span class=\"popular emph\">drok pa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">&rsquo;brog pa</span> who resides on the opposite side of the <span class=\"popular\">Nyungkar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Nyung dkar</span> hill, <span class=\"popular\">Nyungkar Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Nyung dkar rdo ring</span> was erected in the distant past to mark the death of someone. Given the archaeological evidence associated with the walled pillar typology, his oral tradition appears to be historically accurate. </p> <h4 id=\"b2-1-73-4\">Site elements</h4> <h5 id=\"b2-1-73-4-1\">Enclosure</h5> <p>The enclosure is aligned in the cardinal directions and measures 8.2 m (east-west) x 3.4 m (north-south). The entire enclosure is slightly elevated above the surrounding plain. Substantial parts of all four walls of the enclosure are intact. These walls (45 cm to 60 cm thick) are mostly composed of small pieces (around 10 cm long) of blue-gray limestone. These small stones were laid in multiple parallel courses in order to traverse the full width of the walls. There are also double-course wall sections (such as the east wall) made up of larger stones (up to 70 cm long). </p> <h5 id=\"b2-1-73-4-2\">Pillar</h5> <p>The single irregularly shaped pillar is 70 cm in height and has a basal girth of 85 cm. The pillar is centered between the north and south walls, 80 cm from the inner edge of the west wall. The highly worn gray pillar has weathered to assume a reddish and blackish color. </p> <table cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\" class=\"navarrows\"> <tbody> <tr> <td class=\"leftcell\"> <a class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-left.gif\" title=\"Previous Section\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"midcell\"> <a class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-up.gif\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"rightcell\"> <a class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-right.gif\" title=\"Next Section\"/> </a> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div id=\"chap-id\">/bellezza2/b2-1-73/</div> <div style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\" class=\"jqmWindow\" id=\"chapRefWindow\"> <div class=\"closebtn\"> <a href=\"#\">Close</a> </div> <div style=\"height: 280px;\" class=\"conx-content\"> <h3>Note Citation for Page <span class=\"pgnm\"/> </h3> <p class=\"biblref\">John Vincent Bellezza, Antiquities of Zhang Zhung: A Comprehensive Inventory of Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Monuments on he Tibetan Upland (Charlottesville, VA 22904:Tibetan &amp; Himalayan Library, 2010), <span class=\"pgnm\"/>. </p> <h3>Bibliographic Citation</h3> <p>John Vincent Bellezza.
