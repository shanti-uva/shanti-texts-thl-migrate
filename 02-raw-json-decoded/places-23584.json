Regarding the first variant, &ldquo;bo&rdquo; derives from the term bo ti in Amdo dialect, meaning clod, leb means &ldquo;flat&rdquo;. It is said that when Bon blon bla ma established the hermitage in the place where there were many &ldquo;flat clods&rdquo;; the meaning of the second variant remains unknown; the third variant means the &ldquo;arrival of Bon&rdquo;, the explanation for this name was that the master was the first Bonpo to arrive in the region; the fourth variant means &ldquo;the Bon minister&rdquo; which appears in the official documents given to the master by the local authorities of Zung &rsquo;phan during the reign of Qianlong. </div><table xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\" class=\"navarrows\"><tbody><tr><td class=\"leftcell\"><a class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"><img src=\"/global/images/arrow-left.gif\" title=\"Previous Section\"/></a></td><td class=\"midcell\"><a class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"><img src=\"/global/images/arrow-up.gif\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"/></a></td><td class=\"rightcell\"><a class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"><img src=\"/global/images/arrow-right.gif\" title=\"Next Section\"/></a></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div id=\"chap-id\">/bonpo-monasteries/b6-12-1/</div><div style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\" class=\"jqmWindow\" id=\"chapRefWindow\"><div class=\"closebtn\"><a href=\"#\">Close</a></div><div style=\"height: 280px;\" class=\"conx-content\"><h3>Note Citation for Page <span class=\"pgnm\"/></h3><p class=\"biblref\">Dondrup Lhagyal, Phuntso Tsering Sharyul, Tsering Thar, Charles Ramble, and Marietta Kind, A Survey of Bonpo Monasteries and Temples in Tibet and the Himalaya (ISBN: , :, 2010-07-06), <span class=\"pgnm\"/>. </p><h3>Bibliographic Citation</h3><p>Dondrup Lhagyal, Phuntso Tsering Sharyul, Tsering Thar, Charles Ramble, and Marietta Kind.
