Name</h3> <p>Ra lag (or Ru lag) gYung drung gling </p> <h3 id=\"b4-2-2\">2. Location</h3> <p>Starting from the sTag gru kha ferry on the Lhasa-Shigatse highway, one arrives at gYung drung gling Monastery after crossing a small bridge on the &rsquo;O yul Ra chu river. When the river rises in summer, this small bridge is impassable; instead, one must take a roundabout way, crossing another bridge, which takes an hour to get to the monastery.</p> <h3 id=\"b4-2-3\">3. History</h3> <p>The monastery was founded by sNang ston Zla ba rgyal mtshan (b.1796) in 1834 on the bank of the Yarlung Tsangpo river, at the foot of Mount &rsquo;O lha rGyal bzang. Later, the second abbot, sKal bzang nyi ma (b.1841), extended it. Nyi ma bstan &rsquo;dzin (b.1813), the 23rd abbot of sMan ri Monastery, came to help set up philosophical studies and became the chief teacher there. Later, the 5th abbot of the monastery, mKhan chen Shes rab blo ldan, further extended the monastery by building the temple mThong grol lha khang, and Shes rab grags pa, who was a chief teacher, had the large assembly hall (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">&rsquo;du khang</span>) built. There was a residence for the abbot (bla brang) and seven hostels (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">khang tshan</span>) for the monk students, as well as individual houses for the chief teacher and the monks who completed their studies.</p> <p>Formerly, the monastery possessed a great number of gilt-bronze and copper statues, including those of rNam par rgyal ba. In the temples there were reliquary gilt-copper stupas containing the remains of abbots. The monastery was an important seat of learning for Bonpo monks coming from Amdo, rGyal rong, Khyung po, Hor, Khams and nomad regions in Byang thang. It was particularly renowned for its extensive library and had its own woodblocks for printing religious texts. There were normally about two hundred monks resident in the monastery.</p> <p>The 9th abbot, Shes rab bstan pa&rsquo;i rgyal mtshan (1911-1979), had a large gilded rooftop erected on the main hall; he also had a gilt-copper statue of rNam par rgyal ba made, two storeys high. In 1959 he fled to India, and the monastery itself was razed to the ground in 1965 during the Cultural Revolution. In 1982 Shes rab bstan &rsquo;dzin and Kun gsal blo gros, who were monks in the monastery before its destruction, were put in charge of its reconstruction. They managed to have the assembly hall and two temples rebuilt.</p> <p>The monastery had a system of abbotship. Abbots were appointed by a lottery from among those well versed in religious philosophy and having the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">dge bshes</span> degree. The line of abbots of the monastery is as follows:</p> <ol type=\"1\"> <li> sNang ston Zla ba rgyal mtshan</li> <li> sKal bzang nyi ma</li> <li> Phun tshogs dbang rgyal</li> <li> Tshul khrims dbang rgyal</li> <li> Shes rab blo ldan</li> <li> Shes rab bstan pa&rsquo;i nyi ma</li> <li> Blo gros rgyal mtshan</li> <li> Blo gros nyi ma</li> <li> Shes rab bstan pa&rsquo;i rgyal mtshan</li> </ol> <h3 id=\"b4-2-4\">4.

Educational exchange</h3> <p>At present, other Bonpo monasteries, mainly in dBus and gTsang regions, send their monks to study in gYung drung gling, and they are to return to their own monasteries after completing their studies. In addition, various monasteries, such as sKyid mkhar Ri zhing (No.4) and Pus mo sgang (No.8) in Gro mo, invite tutors from gYung drung gling to their monasteries for a few months at a time.</p> <h3 id=\"b4-2-8\">8.

In addition, the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">bskang gso</span> ritual is regularly performed for the guardians of the monastery.</p> <p>During the summer the monks go to recite scriptures at private homes of farmers and herdsmen in areas such as Nagchukha, Hor, and Khyung po. The rest of the time the monks stay in the monastery, and their families provide their daily necessities.</p> <h3 id=\"b4-2-10\">10.
