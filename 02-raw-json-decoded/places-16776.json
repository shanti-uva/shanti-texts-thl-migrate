In between the benches and valley bottom is a zone of farmland. On the opposite side of the <span class=\"popular\">Dungkar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dung dkar</span> valley is the formation of <span class=\"popular\">Dzari Go</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdza ri sgo</span>, which hosts three famous cave chapels with fine Buddhist frescos. The west bench and adjoining areas of <span class=\"popular\">Dingdum</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sdings zlum</span> have many ruined <span class=\"popular emph\">Ch&ouml;rten</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mchod rten</span> and the ruins of what appears to have been a small chapel (<span class=\"popular emph\">lhakang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">lha khang</span>).<a href=\"#n59\" name=\"nb59\" class=\"note\">59</a> By contrast, the east bench has no <span class=\"popular emph\">Ch&ouml;rten</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mchod rten</span>, as his is the location of an archaic cultural horizon cemetery. It may be that the mchod rten, erected on the adjacent bench, was done so to counteract perceived harmful influences emanating from the burial ground. <span class=\"popular\">Dingdum</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sdings zlum</span> contains at least 23 small graves. All specimens are less than 3 m across. They are aggregated in small groups, spread out over a 180-m transection. The bench on which they are located is moderately inclined to the south and strewn with rocks. The site is enclosed by gullies on the west and east sides, and thereafter by ridges. </p> <p>Only a minority of the funerary structures have coherent wall sections, which in part, can be explained by the fact that some of them were opened on a recent archaeological expedition.<a href=\"#n60\" name=\"nb60\" class=\"note\">60</a> Many of the simply built quadrate and sub-rectangular enclosures and grave pits appear to possess single-course perimeter walls and those of non-descript construction (50 cm to 75 cm thick). Other superstructures appear to have consisted of the ground surface being entirely covered in stones without any particular pattern discernable. Stones were laid flat and are generally between 20 cm and 60 cm in length. In addition to the layer of stones on the surface, there is a second and sometimes a third layer of stones set below the ground surface. This stonework is crude in character and the grave pits are very shallow (40 cm to 75 cm deep). Although some of he grave pits now have an irregular form, it appears that a majority of them were quadrate (some of which were more or less aligned in the cardinal directions). The small enclosures and minimal subsurface constructions of <span class=\"popular\">Dingdum</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sdings zlum</span> contrast with many sites on the <span class=\"popular\">Jangtang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Byang thang</span>, which are of a much more elaborate nature. Furthermore, local sources report that only a small amount of human skeletal remains (no complete skeletons) were discovered in the open graves of <span class=\"popular\">Dingdum</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sdings zlum</span>. This may possibly indicate that some of these structures had a funerary ritual function rather than a burial function. The small size of the pits indicates that those that functioned as tombs contained flexed, fractional, juvenile, or secondary interments. </p> <h4 id=\"b2-2-24-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>None was collected.</p> <h4 id=\"b2-2-24-4\">Site elements</h4> <p>Although the tombs of <span class=\"popular\">Dingdum</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sdings zlum</span> have been competently studied, in the interests of conservation and further scientific exploration, elements of the site have been documented for this inventory. At the time of the survey, these tombs had the following dimensions, locations and characteristics: </p> <ol> <li>Funerary structure FS1 (2 m x 3 m) is the highest and most southerly specimen at the site (31&deg; 40.024&#900; N. lat. / 79&deg; 49.176&#900; / 4260 m). FS1 is situated on the rim of the bench overlooking the east gully.

It consists of a nebulously designed superstructure that appears to have been quadrate in form.</li> <li>Funerary structure FS5 is situated 2 m northeast of FS4 (40.094&#900; / 49.193&#900;). The dimensions of the superstructure are no longer clear. It appears to have been slightly elevated above the surrounding terrain. The excavated grave pit measures 1.3 m x 1.5 m x 60 cm.</li> <li>Funerary structure FS6 (2.5 m x 2.5 m) is situated 4 m east of FS5 (40.094&#900; / 49.197&#900;).

The ambiguously constructed superstructure covers less than 4m&sup2;.</li> <li>Funerary structure FS8 is situated 4 m north/down slope of FS7 on the rim overlooking the east gully (40.092&#900; / 49.213&#900;). Very little structural evidence remains on the surface.</li> <li>Funerary structures FS9, FS10 and FS11 form a line across the breadth of the slope below the FS4&ndash;FS6 row. </li> <li>Funerary structure FS9 (2 m x 1.7 m) is situated 8 m north of FS6 (40.097&#900; / 49.200&#900;).
