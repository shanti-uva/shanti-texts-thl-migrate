{"descriptions":[{"id":1416,"title":null,"content":"\u003cp class=\"Paragraph\"\u003eIn the classical language and in modern literary texts, reported speech is usually marked by the syllable \u003cspan class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\"\u003eཞེས་\u003c/span\u003e at the end of a quotation, or by its variant form \u003cspan class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\"\u003eཅེས་\u003c/span\u003e (the variant \u003cspan class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\"\u003eཤེས་\u003c/span\u003e is archaic).\u003ca href=\"#_ftn1\"\u003e[1]\u003c/a\u003e It functions like its oral homologue \u003cspan class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\"\u003eཟེ་\u003c/span\u003e and comes immediately before the verb of speech. Although this marker is usually used for direct speech, it may also be used to introduce reported speech. There is no structural (or syntactic) difference between the two types of speech. The ways in which reported speech is introduced vary in Classical Tibetan and, apart from \u003cspan class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\"\u003eཞེས་\u003c/span\u003e, there are several other ways of ending a quotation, although these are used less frequently. The most common are as follows:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \u003chr size=\"1\" /\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_ftnref1\"\u003e[1]\u003c/a\u003e Concerning the use of variants, see the table in the section on \u0026ldquo;case\u0026rdquo; in this Reference Grammar.
