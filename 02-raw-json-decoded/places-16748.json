The site is situated on a sandy bench that gently slopes down towards the west, in plain view of <span class=\"popular\">Dangra Gyutso</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dang ra g.yu mtsho</span> and the <span class=\"popular\">Tago</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rta rgo</span> range. A ridge to the east partly blocks the view in this direction. <span class=\"popular\">Dolang Nyidrik</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo lang gnyis sgrig</span> consists of four pillars erected inside a rectangular enclosure. No outlying funerary structures were detected at the site, but they could have been easily engulfed by the sandy terrain. <span class=\"popular\">Dolang Nyidrik</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo lang gnyis sgrig</span> is one of six walled pillar monuments (C-49, C-50, C-68, C-69, C-71, C-72) in the <span class=\"popular\">Pundri Tsangpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Phu &rsquo;bri gtsang po</span> valley, one of the greatest concentrations of such sites in Upper Tibet. This cluster of funerary pillar sites is probably associated with the chain of residential sites that were located near the shores of <span class=\"popular\">Dangra Gyutso</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dang ra g.yu mtsho</span>, as complementary parts of its archaic monumental assemblage. </p> <h4 id=\"b2-1-106-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>The elders of <span class=\"popular\">Pusum</span><span class=\"scholar\">Spu gsum</span> are uncertain as to whether <span class=\"popular\">Dolang Nyidrik</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo lang gnyis sgrig</span> is an ancient <span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span> or <span class=\"popular\">Zhang Zhung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Zhang zhung</span> monument. </p> <h4 id=\"b2-1-106-4\">Site elements</h4> <h5 id=\"b2-1-106-4-1\">Enclosure</h5> <p>The enclosure is generally aligned in the cardinal directions, and measures 6.5 m (south wall) x 7 m (north wall) x 5 m (west wall) x 4.5 m (east wall). Parts of all four double-course walls (50 cm to 80 cm thick) are extant. These walls are composed of uncut pieces of gray limestone, 10 cm to 50 cm in length. These stones were laid flat and inserted edgewise into the ground, and are generally level with the surface or project above it to a maximum height of 20 cm. The west/lower side of the enclosure is somewhat elevated in order to compensate for he slope gradient. The interior of the enclosure is entirely open. </p> <h5 id=\"b2-1-106-4-2\">Pillars</h5> <p>The four pillars form a somewhat uneven north-south oriented row. These highly eroded, beige to brownish standing stones have a white grain, a well developed patina and orange climax lichen growing on them. As there are no suitable stones in the vicinity, these pillars must have been transported from somewhere else. From south o north, the dimensions and characteristics of the pillars are as follows:</p> <ol> <li>Long-stone DR1: four uneven sides, located 1 m from the inner edge of the west wall of the enclosure (1 m [height] x 1 m [basal girth]).</li> <li>Long-stone DR2: tabular, located 1.5 m north of DR1 and 50 cm from the west wall (1.1 m x 1.25 m). </li> <li>Long-stone DR3: three irregular sides, broken tip, situated 50 cm north of DR2 and about 1.2 m from the west wall (75 cm x 85 cm). </li> <li>Long-stone DR4: four-sided, broken top, located 20 cm north of DR3 and about 1.2 m from the west wall (30 cm x 70 cm). </li> </ol> <table cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\" class=\"navarrows\"> <tbody> <tr> <td class=\"leftcell\"> <a class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-left.gif\" title=\"Previous Section\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"midcell\"> <a class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-up.gif\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"rightcell\"> <a class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-right.gif\" title=\"Next Section\"/> </a> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div id=\"chap-id\">/bellezza2/b2-1-106/</div> <div style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\" class=\"jqmWindow\" id=\"chapRefWindow\"> <div class=\"closebtn\"> <a href=\"#\">Close</a> </div> <div style=\"height: 280px;\" class=\"conx-content\"> <h3>Note Citation for Page <span class=\"pgnm\"/> </h3> <p class=\"biblref\">John Vincent Bellezza, Antiquities of Zhang Zhung: A Comprehensive Inventory of Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Monuments on he Tibetan Upland (Charlottesville, VA 22904:Tibetan &amp; Himalayan Library, 2010), <span class=\"pgnm\"/>. </p> <h3>Bibliographic Citation</h3> <p>John Vincent Bellezza.
