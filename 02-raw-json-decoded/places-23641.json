Dolpa) District</h2> <h3 id=\"b7-2-11\">(230) Khri brtan nor bu rtse Monastery</h3> <h4 id=\"b7-2-11-1\">1. Name</h4> <p>Bon dgon dpal ldan khri brtan nor bu rtse</p> <h4 id=\"b7-2-11-2\">2. Location</h4> <p>The monastery is located on the western outskirts of Kathmandu city. It is built on the slope of a hill and has an extensive view overlooking the city. The place is called Ropa by the local people and is in the vicinity of Swayambhunath stupa.</p> <h4 id=\"b7-2-11-3\">3. History </h4> <p>In 1986, Yongs &rsquo;dzin bsTan &rsquo;dzin rnam dag initiated the building of a house built at this location with the financial help of an American friend. He thought that a Bon religious centre in Kathmandu would be desirable considering that there are fairly large areas in Nepal where the population adheres to the Bon religion and his idea was unanimously supported by the Bonpo community in Kathmandu. It was dPal &rsquo;byor nor bu, however, a resident of Kathmandu and a member of the Bonpo community, who played the leading role in dealing with the purchase of land and obtaining official permission for construction as well as fund-raising. When Yongs &rsquo;dzin bsTan &rsquo;dzin rnam dag went to visit Tibet from India he stayed in the new house while in Kathmandu. While he was there, monks from different places came to see him and he started giving them teachings. However, the actual temple was founded in 1992 and a little later the work on the interior decoration and surrounding areas were completed. In 1994, the consecration of the new assembly hall was carried out by the abbot of sMan ri in Dolanji and Yongs &rsquo;dzin bsTan &rsquo;dzin rnam dag. </p> <p>The establishment gradually developed into a monastery and dGe bshes Nyi ma dbang rgyal was appointed as its first abbot by the abbot of sMan ri Monastery in Dolanji (No.231) and Yongs &rsquo;dzin bsTan &rsquo;dzin rnam dag in 1992. </p> <p>The monastery has an assembly hall (&rsquo;du khang), a residence of the abbot (bla brang) and a building that houses the library, guest rooms as well as rooms prepared specially for computer work. There are also several buildings for accommodating the monks. </p> <p>The monastery has two distinct establishments: the bshad grwa (centre for studies of philosphy and logic) and the sgom grwa (centre for meditation practice). In 1996, dGe bshes bsTan pa g-yung drung, who obtained his dge bshes degree in sMan ri Monastery in Dolanji, became the dpon slob, the principal teacher. In 2001 he succeeded the abbot Nyi ma dbang rgyal as the second abbot of the monastery. Since then mKhan po bsTan pa g-yung drung has been in charge of the whole establishment. Amongst other heavy duties, he supervises students as well as doing his own research. In 2002, dGe bshes Tshul khrims bstan &rsquo;dzin was appointed as the chief of the meditation centre.</p> <h4 id=\"b7-2-11-4\"> 4.
