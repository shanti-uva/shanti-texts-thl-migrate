The site is under the shadow of the <span class=\"popular\">Gekh&ouml; Kharlung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ge khod mkhar lung</span> castle (A-89), situated just to the west. <span class=\"popular\">Gekh&ouml; Kharlung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ge khod mkhar lung</span> (Lower) is comprised of a residential complex consisting of caves and structural vestiges. Although this site is highly degraded, it appears to have once been the focus of significant settlement. The structural dispersion covers an area of 30 m x 70 m, and extends 10 m up the slope bounding the right side of the <span class=\"popular\">Gekh&ouml; Kharlung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ge khod mkhar lung</span> valley. At the bottom end of the site there is a group of corrals built deeply into the slope. They were created from old buildings, some of the footings of which exist in the walls of the livestock pens. These corrals no longer seem to be in use. The upper part of the site consists of no less than 12 collapsed or partly collapsed caves, which had been hewn from the earth and rock of the slope. At the mouth of a few caves are races of masonry fa&ccedil;ades. The caves appear to have been relatively small in size.</p> <h4 id=\"b1-2-23-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>According to some <span class=\"popular\">Rutok</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ru thog</span> natives, <span class=\"popular\">Gekh&ouml; Kharlung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ge khod mkhar lung</span> (Lower) was an ancient <span class=\"popular\">Kel M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Skal mon</span> residential site.</p> <h4 id=\"b1-2-23-4\">Affiliated sites</h4> <h5 id=\"b1-2-23-4-1\">East residential structure</h5> <p>In the first side valley, east or upstream of the <span class=\"popular\">Gekh&ouml; Kharlung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ge khod mkhar lung</span> citadel, there is another building foundation (33&ordm; 20.8΄ N. lat. / 79&ordm; 44.8΄ E. long / 4420 m). This very poorly preserved structure (8 m x 12 m) is found on a moderate slope squeezed between two gullies. It appears that this was once a substantial edifice. Like most structures at <span class=\"popular\">Gekh&ouml; Kharlung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ge khod mkhar lung</span>, this ruined building is in direct view of the Bon holy mountain <span class=\"popular\">Gekh&ouml; Nyenlung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ge khod gnyan lung</span>.</p> <h5 id=\"b1-2-23-4-2\">Valley bottom remains</h5> <p>In the bottom of the <span class=\"popular\">Gekh&ouml; Kharlung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ge khod mkhar lung</span> valley, under the shadow of the ancient citadel, there appears to be many traces of manmade structures. So little evidence remains that their existence could not be positively established. The entire valley floor is covered in boulders that appear to have been deposited by a devastating flood originating from he <span class=\"popular\">Lhalung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Lha lung</span> valley. The present-day seasonal agricultural village of <span class=\"popular\">Gekh&ouml; Kharlung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ge khod mkhar lung</span> may also have obscured traces of earlier settlement. Other archaic citadels in the region (<span class=\"popular\">Kharru khargok</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mkhar ru mkhar gog</span> (A-85), <span class=\"popular\">Posa khargok</span><span class=\"scholar\">Spo sa mkhar gog</span> (A-84), <span class=\"popular\">Sherang Kharlung</span><span class=\"scholar\">She rang mkhar lung</span> (A-87), and <span class=\"popular\">Kharpoche</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mkhar po che</span> (A-86)) are associated with extensive residential remains, so we might expect that the important valley of <span class=\"popular\">Gekh&ouml; Kharlung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ge khod mkhar lung</span> was as well. The presence of arable land in the valley adds o the likelihood that it has long been a focus of sedentary settlement.</p> <table class=\"navarrows\" cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\"> <tbody> <tr> <td class=\"leftcell\"><a class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"> <img title=\"Previous Section\" src=\"../../../../../global/images/arrow-left.gif\" alt=\"\" /> </a></td> <td class=\"midcell\"><a class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"> <img title=\"Beginning of Article\" src=\"../../../../../global/images/arrow-up.gif\" alt=\"\" /> </a></td> <td class=\"rightcell\"><a class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"> <img title=\"Next Section\" src=\"../../../../../global/images/arrow-right.gif\" alt=\"\" /> </a></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div id=\"chap-id\">/bellezza/b1-2-23/</div> <div id=\"chapRefWindow\" class=\"jqmWindow\" style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\"> <div class=\"closebtn\"><a href=\"#\">Close</a></div> <div class=\"conx-content\" style=\"height: 280px;\"> <h3>Note Citation for Page <span class=\"pgnm\"> </span></h3> <p class=\"biblref\">John Vincent Bellezza, Antiquities of Zhang Zhung: A Comprehensive Inventory of Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Monuments on he Tibetan Upland (Charlottesville, VA 22904:Tibetan &amp; Himalayan Library, 2010), <span class=\"pgnm\">. </span></p> <h3>Bibliographic Citation</h3> <p>John Vincent Bellezza.
