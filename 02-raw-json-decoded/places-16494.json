There are also a few stone foundations at the site. ka ling <span class=\"popular emph\">khar</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mkhar</span> overlooks the west side of the <span class=\"popular\">Dawa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mda' ba</span> valley, and is situated several kilometers down valley from the township headquarters. The compact group of ruins is approximately 30 m in length, and walls up to 2 m in height have endured. The period in which this stronghold was established is not at all clear. Local residents believe that the site has a Buddhist identity. At this juncture in the inquiry, antecedent settlement at <span class=\"popular\">Kaling</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ka gling</span> is a matter of speculation. The important agrarian <span class=\"popular\">Dawa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mda' ba</span> valley must have supported archaic cultural installations but their location remains to be determined. </p> <h4 id=\"b1-1-14-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>According to local residents, <span class=\"popular\">Kaling</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ka gling</span> was a castle.</p> <h4 id=\"b1-1-14-4\">Affiliated sites</h4> <h5 id=\"b1-1-14-4-1\"> <span class=\"popular\">Dawa Kharts&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mda' ba mkhar rtse</span> </h5> <p>The Buddhist era fortress of <span class=\"popular\">Dawa Kharts&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mda' ba mkhar rtse</span> is located near the township headquarters, and was destroyed during the Chinese Cultural Revolution. One of its most notable features is a 20-m long tunnel that burrows through the formation. There is also a deep subterranean well at the site. No archaic architectural traces were detected at this location.</p> <h5 id=\"b1-1-14-4-2\">Mi la</h5> <p>At the confluence of the mda&rsquo; ba chu and Sutlej (Sutlej river) there is the defunct settlement of <span class=\"popular\">Mila</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mi la</span>. This locale was once brought under cultivation. Bounding one side of the alluvial plain is an earthen escarpment with about two dozen erstwhile residential caves. On the opposite side of the Sutlej are the traces of a pre-modern gold mine, stretching over a distance of more than 2 km (31&deg; 18.2&#900; N. lat. / 80&deg; 00.5&#900; E. long. / 3880 m). This location is called <span class=\"popular\">Gyungkyang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rgyungs rkyang</span>, and consists of many small piles of cobbles and depressions pock marking a shelf, where shallow pit mining once took place.</p> <hr class=\"footnote-divider\"/> <h2>Notes</h2> <div class=\"footnote\"> <a name=\"n34\"/> <a href=\"#nb34\" class=\"note\"> [34] </a> I was unable to access the site due to the collapse of the upper reaches of the earthen formation upon which it sits. </div> <table cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\" class=\"navarrows\"> <tbody> <tr> <td class=\"leftcell\"> <a class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-left.gif\" title=\"Previous Section\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"midcell\"> <a class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-up.gif\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"rightcell\"> <a class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-right.gif\" title=\"Next Section\"/> </a> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div id=\"chap-id\">/bellezza/b1-1-14/</div> <div style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\" class=\"jqmWindow\" id=\"chapRefWindow\"> <div class=\"closebtn\"> <a href=\"#\">Close</a> </div> <div style=\"height: 280px;\" class=\"conx-content\"> <h3>Note Citation for Page <span class=\"pgnm\"/> </h3> <p class=\"biblref\">John Vincent Bellezza, Antiquities of Zhang Zhung: A Comprehensive Inventory of Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Monuments on he Tibetan Upland (Charlottesville, VA 22904:Tibetan &amp; Himalayan Library, 2010), <span class=\"pgnm\"/>. </p> <h3>Bibliographic Citation</h3> <p>John Vincent Bellezza.
