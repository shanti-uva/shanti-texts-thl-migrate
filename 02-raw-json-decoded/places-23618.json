History</h4> <p>After several unsuccessful attempts, Dar rgyas Monastery was the first Bonpo monastery to have been founded in the Khod po area. It was founded by Khod po sKal bzang nyi ma in the 10th Rab byung (1567-1626). The monastery was maintained by his descendants as the successive heads of the monastery:</p> <ol type=\"1\"> <li>Khod po sKal bzang nyi ma</li> <li>bsTan &rsquo;dzin rgyal mtshan</li> <li>Nam mkha&rsquo; rgyal po</li> <li>Shes rab blo gros</li> <li>Yu bo</li> </ol> <p>The fifth is the present head of the monastery. He was studying at Brag g-yung drung Hermitage (No.207) in Shar khog under the master Khyung g-yang when I visited Dar rgyas Monastery in autumn 1998. Since he is too young to take on his responsibilities, Phun tshogs &rsquo;od zer, a master from the Bon &rsquo;khor lineage of Rab dben Monastery (No.215) in the same county, was invited to look after the monastery.<a href=\"#n61\" name=\"nb61\" class=\"note\">61</a> The monastery was rebuilt in the 1980s.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-16-14-4\">4.
