From sTeng chen rdzong, travelling about twelve kilometres westward on the highway, we reach the village of Ra khrom. After crossing a small bridge, a walk of more than half an hour in a south-westerly direction leads us to the monastery. Situated on a hill and surrounded by a number of holy mountains, it lies to the east of the Four Great Sacred Places of Tibet, south of the Thang lha range, on the highland between the rivers rNgul chu and rDza chu, and near sTeng chen Monastery (No.35). It was the place where sPrul sku Blo ldan snying po received the \u003cspan xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"\u003emDo Dri med gzi brjid\u003c/span\u003e as an oral tradition and wrote it down.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe monastery was first supported by benefactors gSas sar Nam mka\u0026rsquo; g-yung drung, the owner of the land, \u0026rsquo;Be ru bon srung and sTag rtsa rGyal mtshan. The Shel masters played an important role in the monastery. The origin of the Shel lineage is as follows: long ago in China, there was a man called Kun dga\u0026rsquo; \u0026rsquo;od \u0026rsquo;phro. He lived amidst flowers in an ocean that emitted lights. He miraculously produced a white crystal egg from which a little man appeared. He had turquoise hair and a white chin-tuft; he was dressed in white silk and was holding a lotus. He was found by the king of China, who called him Zing ba mthu chen. He became a prelate in the court and came to have the name Legs tang mang po. bSam gtan rgyal mtshan, one of his descendants, migrated to Tibet, where he subdued many gods and demons. He was followed by Khro bo rgyal mtshan and Zhig chung Nam mkha\u0026rsquo; mtha\u0026rsquo; bral.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn 1454, Yag snya bSod nams rgyal mtshan founded the monastery at gYang ra brag rtsar. He named the monastery Ka legs gYung drung gling. He raised funds for the commemoration of the great master mNyam med Shes rab rgyal mtshan and made sure that the rituals he established in the monastery closely followed the teachings of the master. There were only seven monks, including the lama Tshe dbang rgyal mtshan of rDzogs mda\u0026rsquo; and Tshul khrims. There was a complete set of religious objects and implements for making offerings, such as the \u003cspan xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"\u003egandi\u003c/span\u003e, a drum, a stone gong and a conch.

The old site was small and unsafe. So, in the time of lHun grub rgya mtsho, a discussion was held among all the laity and clergy and it was agreed that the monastery should be moved to Ka bzos sribs. It was therefore rebuilt and the religious objects of body, speech and mind were installed. Celebrations and the study of the \u003cspan xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"\u003etshad ma\u003c/span\u003e logic were re-established.

They also completely burned the monastery. Phun tshogs bstan \u0026rsquo;dzin grags pa (1888-1954) and his three disciples, Nyi ma grags pa, bsTan pa\u0026rsquo;i rgyal mtshan and gYung drung rgyal ba, could no longer live there.

He assigned A drung to the restoration of the monastery and sent him to Hor in order to bring back the above-mentioned monks. The governor-general ordered the chief of dKar ru and his people to provide labour, as well as to transport the timber that was needed.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn 1914, Phun tshogs bstan \u0026rsquo;dzin grags pa himself laid the foundation of the main hall.

In the process of searching for the reincarnation, Ka legs Monastery made offerings of twelve thousand sacrificial cakes (\u003cspan xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"\u003etshogs\u003c/span\u003e) to the tutelary deity Phur pa and to the protective deities. It was known that the reincarnation himself said, \u0026ldquo;I am going to Ka legs\u0026rdquo;, and showed many miraculous signs, which were actually heard by the attendant monks. The father of the reincarnation, who was called Tshang stobs rgyal mtshan, belonged to the lineage in which Me ston Shes rab \u0026rsquo;od zer in Yar \u0026rsquo;brog was born and the mother belonged to the lineage of Zhig po. At that time there were about seventy monks in the monastery. Among them were Rin chen tshul khrims, bsTan pa rgyal mtshan, Ye shes dbang ldan and bZod pa mthar phyin, who were all very learned, having studied logic and Sanskrit, as well as being accomplished in meditation according to the Oral Tradition of Zhang zhung.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn short, this monastery has experienced rises and falls in the course of its own history, but it had the capacity to produce a series of eminent monks who were able to uphold the Bon doctrine and it is one of the oldest and important Bonpo monasteries.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe monastery is surrounded by the following sacred sites: Sa yi brag ri sgor mo, where the \u003cspan xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"\u003emDo Dri med gzi brjid \u003c/span\u003ewas written down\u003cspan xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"\u003e \u003c/span\u003eby Blo ldan snying po; Sa sho mda\u0026rsquo;, where there is the self-risen \u003cspan xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"\u003eMa tri\u003c/span\u003e mantra and swastika; bDe chen lha ri gnam rdzong; Chu na ma; and the holy mountain Dong rdzong smug po mched brgyad, regarded as the site blessed by Dran pa nam mkha\u0026rsquo; and his son Tshe dbang rig \u0026rsquo;dzin.
