These ostensible residential remains are situated immediately south of the lake outlet known as <span class=\"popular\">Gangga Chu</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gangga chu</span>. The main concentration of structures covers approximately 400m&sup2;, between a rocky knob in the east and a cliff face in the west. Until quite recently, significant walls were found here but they have been dismantled and the stones removed to build structures at the burgeoning <span class=\"popular\">J iu</span><span class=\"scholar\">Byi&rsquo;u</span> village. A road passes directly below the site so it was relatively easy o haul the stones away by truck. Virtually only one section of an east-west running revetment has survived intact, otherwise the site is blanketed in loose uncut blocks of limestone. The integral revetment is 11 m in length and parallels the axis of the bluff and ridge above it. This wall was primarily built of large stones (up o 1.1 m in length) set in random courses. On the higher reaches of the bluff, possible wall-footings are found among old and new cairns. </p> <p>The local identification of the byi&rsquo;u sing pa&rsquo; mkhar as a stronghold may not be correct. There was a hilltop fortress at nearby <span class=\"popular\">J iu</span><span class=\"scholar\">Byi&rsquo;u</span>, a much more strategically sound location (A-82), and this would appear to obviate the military value of the site. Immediately to the west of the facility there is higher ground from which a devastating attack could have been launched. Upper Tibetan fortresses of the archaic cultural horizon were never established in such vulnerable locations. It is more plausible that this site was a religious center of some kind. The lack of a localized Buddhist identity and the site&rsquo;s attribution to a foreign group potentially allude to an archaic cultural origin, but morphological evidence is lacking at the site. </p> <h4 id=\"b1-2-32-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>Local elders state that <span class=\"popular\">Jiu Singp&eacute; Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Byi&rsquo;u sing pa&rsquo;i mkhar</span> was a castle of the <span class=\"popular\">Singpa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sing pa</span>.</p> <h4 id=\"b1-2-32-4\">Affiliated sites</h4> <h5 id=\"b1-2-32-4-1\">Funerary cairns</h5> <p>There are long, slim, tapering cairns on top of the bluff at <span class=\"popular\">Jiu Singp&eacute; Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Byi&rsquo;u sing pa&rsquo;i mkhar</span>, Local sources refer to these as <span class=\"popular emph\">m&ouml;n do</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mon rdo</span> (stones of the <span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span>), and are said to have been erected by people of Himalayan origin whilst on pilgrimage to ma pang g.yu mtsho. These pre-modern shrines were raised to commemorate the recent death of family members, a custom found among various Himalayan rim-land peoples of Uttaranchal and Himachal Pradesh. The placement of these shrines on high ground mimics the much older custom of building tombs on mountaintops in Upper Tibet. </p> <table cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\" class=\"navarrows\"> <tbody> <tr> <td class=\"leftcell\"> <a class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-left.gif\" title=\"Previous Section\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"midcell\"> <a class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-up.gif\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"rightcell\"> <a class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-right.gif\" title=\"Next Section\"/> </a> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div id=\"chap-id\">/bellezza/b1-2-32/</div> <div style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\" class=\"jqmWindow\" id=\"chapRefWindow\"> <div class=\"closebtn\"> <a href=\"#\">Close</a> </div> <div style=\"height: 280px;\" class=\"conx-content\"> <h3>Note Citation for Page <span class=\"pgnm\"/> </h3> <p class=\"biblref\">John Vincent Bellezza, Antiquities of Zhang Zhung: A Comprehensive Inventory of Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Monuments on he Tibetan Upland (Charlottesville, VA 22904:Tibetan &amp; Himalayan Library, 2010), <span class=\"pgnm\"/>. </p> <h3>Bibliographic Citation</h3> <p>John Vincent Bellezza.
