Geographically it belongs to the sGang gsum rong drug (\u0026ldquo;three hills and six gorges\u0026rdquo;).\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe bo County is located in southeast Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Gansu province in China. The county covers an area of 51,480000 sq km, 60% of which are covered by forest. The county is divided into twelve districts (\u003cspan xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"\u003exiang\u003c/span\u003e): sTeng ka, Gyi ba, Kha pa, sTag ra, Nyin ngo, dBang bzang, Huayuan, A zha, rDo ra, Ri dbang, Bya \u0026rsquo;bab and La rtse khog. It comprises a total of two hundred and twenty-one villages. The population is 3201, about 80% of which are Tibetan. Most of the inhabitants are farmers who practise both agriculture and animal husbandry.\u003c/p\u003e \u003ch3 id=\"b6-1-2\"\u003eHistory \u003c/h3\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe bo was occupied by A zha in the sixth century, and descendents of A zha\u0026rsquo;s people may still be found in the following thirteen villages in A zha valley (A zha khog), one of the side-gorges in A zha district (\u003cspan xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"\u003exiang\u003c/span\u003e): Nags sked, A rta srib, Khe lam, Phyug bcu, Pe gseb, Nags gong, Nyin pa, bTsun mo, sMad lung, rGyab klu gong ma, rGyab klu \u0026rsquo;og ma, lTag srib, Sa dkar sgang. Shortly after A zha\u0026rsquo;s invasion, the Tibetan army defeated A zha\u0026rsquo;s forces and annexed the whole The bo area to Tibet. Ancient Chinese Sources refer to The bo as Di Zhou (Di is the Chinese pronunciation of The, Zhou the Chinese word for prefecture), and state that it was established as a prefecture in 577 A.D. It is also mentioned that at the time, in addition to the present The bo county area, the prefecture included mDzo dge and Nan ping located in present day southern Gansu. In recent history The bo was conquered from the North by the King of Cone and remained under the control of Cone until the nineteen-forties. The bo was intergrated into Cone Autonomous Region in 1950 and established as a separate county in 1962.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIt is not certain when Bon first reached the area; according to oral history, it was during the Imperial period when the Yarlung kings unified Tibet and the \u0026rsquo;Phags pa rnams gsum spread Bon in Amdo. Later, with the development of Buddhism in the area, many Bonpo monasteries were converted to Buddhism, especially to the dGe lugs pa tradition.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThere are more than twenty Buddhist monasteries in The bo, all of which are dGe lugs pa with the exception of sPe gu Monastery which is Sa skya pa. The first Buddhist monastery in The bo appears to be sTeng ka Monastery, which was founded by dPal Shes rab \u0026rsquo;bar, a famous disciple of \u0026rsquo;Phags pa Blo gros rgyal mtshan (1235-1281), and which was later converted to the dGe lugs pa tradition. The dGe lugs pa began to establish monasteries in the area from the late sixteenth century onwards --three monasteries at the end of the sixteenth century, six in the seventeenth century, six in the eighteenth century, three in the nineteenth century, whose foundation date remains unknown.\u003c/p\u003e \u003ch3 id=\"b6-1-3\"\u003e(91) gTso tshang Monastery\u003c/h3\u003e \u003ch4 id=\"b6-1-3-1\"\u003e1. Name \u003c/h4\u003e \u003cp\u003egTso tshang Monastery\u0026rsquo;s full name is gSang sngags smin grol dar rgyas gling. gTso is the family name of gTso \u0026rsquo;phags Zla ba rgyal mtshan whose descendents founded the three monasteries -Ze kha, Bya brang and gSer gzhong- that constitute gTso tshang. Since the monastery is presently located in Legs lung village, it is also known as Legs lung Monastery. In the local dialect, the name of the village used to be La lo, but since no one no longer knows the original meaning of the term, the monastery\u0026rsquo;s name was recently changed to Legs lung, \u0026ldquo;Good Valley\u0026rdquo;, because of the term\u0026rsquo;s positive connotation.\u003c/p\u003e \u003ch4 id=\"b6-1-3-2\"\u003e2. Location\u003c/h4\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn the early nineteen-eighties, the authorities granted permission to rebuild Ze kha, Bya brang and gSer gzhong monasteries together as one monastery at the site of Bya brang Monastery in Bya brang village, where the main assembly hall (\u003cspan xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"\u003e\u0026rsquo;du khang\u003c/span\u003e) had escaped destruction. However, since there was no longer enough land there to rebuild all three monasteries, Legs lung village was chosen as a new site. The site is located in Drongtsa (\u0026rsquo;Brong tsha) valley, 2 km east of the The bo county seat. The mountain behind the monastery (\u003cspan xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"\u003ergyab ri\u003c/span\u003e) is part of the sTag sgang range.

History\u003c/h4\u003e \u003cp\u003eAccording to oral tradition, the three brothers and great Bonpo masters Do \u0026rsquo;phags chen mo, sKyang \u0026rsquo;phags Nyi ma rgyal mtshan and gTso \u0026rsquo;phags Zla ba rgyal mtshan came to Amdo to spread the Bon doctrine. They \u0026ldquo;opened\u0026rdquo; many hermitages (\u003cspan xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"\u003eri khrod\u003c/span\u003e), some of which later became monasteries (for instance, sNang zhig Monastery No. 180, one of the largest Bonpo monasteries in Tibet, was originally a hermitage founded by Do \u0026rsquo;phags chen mo). The three masters played a key role in the first spread of Bon in Amdo. There are descendents of gTso still living in The bo, Khri ka, Shar khog (=Zung chu) and rGan rgya in Amdo. Kyang za Yig rtsis ma, the mother of the three masters, also a fervent Bonpo, established her main residence at a site known as dGu skyang. gTso \u0026rsquo;phags Zla ba rgyal mtshan is believed to have travelled extensively throughout the area, actively spreading the Bon religion. Although he founded only a number of sacred sites (and no monastery), he made a profound impression on the local culture and traditions. One of his mother\u0026rsquo;s sacred sites and his main ritual and cremation sites are located at Chu gter rdzong, on Brag dkar bya rgod, a sacred mountain (\u003cspan xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"\u003egnas ri\u003c/span\u003e) in Amdo. The first Bonpo monasteries were founded much later (only four to five generations ago) by gTso \u0026rsquo;phags\u0026rsquo;s descendents. At present the remaining known descendents of gTso \u0026rsquo;phags live in the three villages that are financing the reconstruction of the three monasteries. Five of the families live in Ra nang village which is responsible for Ze kha Monastery, four in Bya brang village which is responsible for Bya brang Monastery, and two in gSer gzhong village which is responsible for gSer gzhong Monastery. There is no doubt that the \u0026rsquo;Phags pa rnams gsum were lay people and that their religious tradition was permeated by indigenous customs and beliefs. However, the monasteries - which emerged much later - seem to have been strongly influenced by Buddhism.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSince gTso tshang Monastery in fact comprises three monasteries - Ze kha, Bya brang, and gSer gzhong - it is important to mention here the information concerning their respective historical backgrounds.\u003c/p\u003e \u003ch5 id=\"b6-1-3-3-1\"\u003e \u003cspan xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"\u003eZe kha\u003c/span\u003e \u003c/h5\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe date of Ze kha Monastery\u0026rsquo;s foundation and the identity of its founder remain obscure; even A skal, the only surviving monk who has some knowledge on the history of gTso tshang and who wrote the only historical account of the monastery (\u003cspan xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"\u003eTGLG\u003c/span\u003e) is uncertain. The first master of Ze kha Monastery, Shar ba khri skyang, was born in sTod mtsho \u0026rsquo;phel into one of the three Khri skyang villages of Zung chu County in rNga ba Prefecture; the second master was born in rGya myi ya ru (the exact location of which remains unknown). The third master was born in En \u0026rsquo;dzin mtsho \u0026rsquo;dus. During his lifetime the monastery\u0026rsquo;s assembly hall was destroyed by fire and rebuilt. He travelled to Central Tibet and Khams. He was renowned as a saint, and was believed to be endowed with miraculous powers (\u003cspan xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"\u003egrub rtags\u003c/span\u003e); He is said to have founded the monastery\u0026rsquo;s \u003cspan xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"\u003e\u0026rsquo;cham\u003c/span\u003e (monastic dance). The fourth master remains unidentified. The fifth, Bla ma skyabs, was born in lDong ba village of Brag sgom ba; his father was called A dam and his mother Klu mo. He broke his religious vows, so three influential monks of Ze kha - Dran pa skyabs, bSod nams dar rgyas and A rdo - invited Tshul khrims rgyal mtshan, a descendent of Do \u0026rsquo;phags chen po, then aged five, from rNga khog to take his place in 1930. However, the new incumbent also broke his vows when he turned twenty-five, and was replaced by his brother Bon slebs Nam mkha\u0026rsquo; bstan \u0026rsquo;dzin, the present master of gTso tshang Monastery. Before 1958, Ze kha Monastery comprised a two storey assembly hall with five rooms on each floor, a common house (\u003cspan xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"\u003espyi khang\u003c/span\u003e) with nine rooms and a two-storey building with five rooms called rNga sgra khang. According to oral tradition, the monastery was built on the site of an ancient Chinese Han fort.\u003c/p\u003e \u003ch5 id=\"b6-1-3-3-2\"\u003e \u003cspan xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"\u003eBya brang\u003c/span\u003e \u003c/h5\u003e \u003cp\u003eAlthough the real name of Bya brang Monastery\u0026rsquo;s first lama remains unknown, he was locally known as gSer so can and was born in dGu skyang. According to oral tradition, he left dGu skyang with a retinue in search of an auspicious place to build a monastery. Disappointed by the first two sites where he expected to receive some favourable omen, he continued his search. As he was passing through a place called Nags \u0026rsquo;bul beyond Tsha bzo mountain, he came upon a dead body which turned out to be that of the son of the A bze village chief who had been killed by a gang of robbers. He covered up the corpse, left his favourite dog behind to guard the corpse, and went to look for the deceased man\u0026rsquo;s father. He eventually met the chief and his entourage who were looking for the son. The chief, moved by the Lama\u0026rsquo;s solicitude for his dead son, requested him to become his spiritual master and offered him land on which to build the monastery, as well as fields and an estate to support it. The chosen site was known as Bya brang (\u0026ldquo;Bird\u0026rsquo;s chest\u0026rdquo;) because of its garuda-like shape. gSer so can accepted the offer and thus Bya brang Monastery was built. His successor and incarnation was born in Mar sgur village not far from the monastery. Not much is known about the third incarnation except that he too was born in Mar sgur. However there are many fantastical tales relating his miraculous deeds circulating among the local Bonpo community. The fourth incarnation was born in En \u0026rsquo;dzi\u0026rsquo;i snya bza\u0026rsquo;. The fifth was born in 1918, and his father was Klu \u0026rsquo;bum bsod nams. He studied under Hor btsun bsTan \u0026rsquo;dzin blo gros and obtained the Rab \u0026rsquo;byams pa degree at gYung drung gling Monastery (No.2), and thus acquired a reputation as a learned lama. He built a new assembly hall. He died in 1958 at gYung drung gling. Before 1958, the monastery comprised a new assembly hall built of wood with five rooms on each floor, and a two-storey common house (\u003cspan xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"\u003espyi khang\u003c/span\u003e) with five rooms on each floor, likewise built of wood.\u003c/p\u003e \u003ch5 id=\"b6-1-3-3-3\"\u003e \u003cspan xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"\u003egSer gzhong \u003c/span\u003e \u003c/h5\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe first master of gSer gzhong Monastery, a descendent of gTso \u0026rsquo;phags called Thor cog can, arrived from Dwang ra in the North to look for a place to build a monastery. He stopped at the site of gSer gzhong one night to rest and dreamt that a fox had stolen one of his boots, thus preventing him from travelling further. However, he found the fox\u0026rsquo;s den with his boot inside. Thor cog can took this as a favourable omen and decided to build the monastery there. Its construction was financed by A nag dbang chen and gShen tsha glang thar. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThor cog can\u0026rsquo;s reincarnation was born in sTag ri snya nang. The following incarnation and third lama of the monastery was born in En \u0026rsquo;dzi\u0026rsquo;i nyin ri. The fourth, Shes rab bstan \u0026rsquo;dzin was born at sGang ri kha in 1907 and was enthroned at the age of six. He studied under Kun bzang tshang from sNang zhig in The bo and later went himself to sNang zhig to further his studies. He also travelled to central Tibet with an entourage. On the way, at Sog sde in Nag chu kha, he subdued a demon, a feat which earned him considerable fame and popularity. After spending three years at gYung drung gling and seven years at Grwa sa \u0026rsquo;og ma i.e. sTag rtse ri khrod in Kong po to study and collect funds for the monasteries, he returned to The bo where he died in 1954 at the age of forty-seven. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAnother incarnation of the same lama was born almost at the same time, in 1916. His father was named Klu \u0026rsquo;bum and his mother gNam sman \u0026rsquo;tsho. He was enthroned at the age of twelve and his appointed tutor (\u003cspan xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\"\u003eyongs \u0026rsquo;dzin\u003c/span\u003e) was Tshe dbang shes rab. He left the monastery at a young age to search for his own spiritual teacher and whom he found in the person of bSe ba drung ram pa Shes rab phun tshogs at sKyang tshang Monastery (No. 202). He studied and practised assiduously for many years until his master\u0026rsquo;s death, after which he returned to The bo where he spent four years at bDe gsal ri khrod, a hermitage he had founded. He then travelled to Central Tibet with two students via rKyang phyag. There is a record of all the Bonpo and Buddhist monasteries and sacred sites of Amdo, Khams, gTsang, dBus, Nag chu kha, mNga\u0026rsquo; ris which he visited on his way. He also studied under Shar rdza bKra shis rgyal mtshan for two years. While in Central Tibet, he made a three-year retreat to practise the secret Ma rgyud tantra in a cave at lHa ri gyang tho where King dMu khri btsan po is said to have practised the sPyi spungs tantra of the Bon religion. A message from his monastery informing him of a disaster and requesting him to return drew him from his retreat. Back in The bo he chose to stay at the hermitage which he had recently established and not at his residence in the monastery. He became renowned throughout the area as an outstanding lama. He died in 1958 in Cone. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn addition to the above-mentioned lamas of the main lineage, there are many other famous masters and practitioners whose stories are well known by the local population.
