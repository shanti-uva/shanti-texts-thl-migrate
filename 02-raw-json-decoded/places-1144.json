Geographically it belongs to the sGang gsum rong drug (&ldquo;three hills and six gorges&rdquo;).</p> <p>The bo County is located in southeast Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Gansu province in China. The county covers an area of 51,480000 sq km, 60% of which are covered by forest. The county is divided into twelve districts (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">xiang</span>): sTeng ka, Gyi ba, Kha pa, sTag ra, Nyin ngo, dBang bzang, Huayuan, A zha, rDo ra, Ri dbang, Bya &rsquo;bab and La rtse khog. It comprises a total of two hundred and twenty-one villages. The population is 3201, about 80% of which are Tibetan. Most of the inhabitants are farmers who practise both agriculture and animal husbandry.</p> <h3 id=\"b6-1-2\">History </h3> <p>The bo was occupied by A zha in the sixth century, and descendents of A zha&rsquo;s people may still be found in the following thirteen villages in A zha valley (A zha khog), one of the side-gorges in A zha district (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">xiang</span>): Nags sked, A rta srib, Khe lam, Phyug bcu, Pe gseb, Nags gong, Nyin pa, bTsun mo, sMad lung, rGyab klu gong ma, rGyab klu &rsquo;og ma, lTag srib, Sa dkar sgang. Shortly after A zha&rsquo;s invasion, the Tibetan army defeated A zha&rsquo;s forces and annexed the whole The bo area to Tibet. Ancient Chinese Sources refer to The bo as Di Zhou (Di is the Chinese pronunciation of The, Zhou the Chinese word for prefecture), and state that it was established as a prefecture in 577 A.D. It is also mentioned that at the time, in addition to the present The bo county area, the prefecture included mDzo dge and Nan ping located in present day southern Gansu. In recent history The bo was conquered from the North by the King of Cone and remained under the control of Cone until the nineteen-forties. The bo was intergrated into Cone Autonomous Region in 1950 and established as a separate county in 1962.</p> <p>It is not certain when Bon first reached the area; according to oral history, it was during the Imperial period when the Yarlung kings unified Tibet and the &rsquo;Phags pa rnams gsum spread Bon in Amdo. Later, with the development of Buddhism in the area, many Bonpo monasteries were converted to Buddhism, especially to the dGe lugs pa tradition.</p> <p>There are more than twenty Buddhist monasteries in The bo, all of which are dGe lugs pa with the exception of sPe gu Monastery which is Sa skya pa. The first Buddhist monastery in The bo appears to be sTeng ka Monastery, which was founded by dPal Shes rab &rsquo;bar, a famous disciple of &rsquo;Phags pa Blo gros rgyal mtshan (1235-1281), and which was later converted to the dGe lugs pa tradition. The dGe lugs pa began to establish monasteries in the area from the late sixteenth century onwards --three monasteries at the end of the sixteenth century, six in the seventeenth century, six in the eighteenth century, three in the nineteenth century, whose foundation date remains unknown.</p> <h3 id=\"b6-1-3\">(91) gTso tshang Monastery</h3> <h4 id=\"b6-1-3-1\">1. Name </h4> <p>gTso tshang Monastery&rsquo;s full name is gSang sngags smin grol dar rgyas gling. gTso is the family name of gTso &rsquo;phags Zla ba rgyal mtshan whose descendents founded the three monasteries -Ze kha, Bya brang and gSer gzhong- that constitute gTso tshang. Since the monastery is presently located in Legs lung village, it is also known as Legs lung Monastery. In the local dialect, the name of the village used to be La lo, but since no one no longer knows the original meaning of the term, the monastery&rsquo;s name was recently changed to Legs lung, &ldquo;Good Valley&rdquo;, because of the term&rsquo;s positive connotation.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-1-3-2\">2. Location</h4> <p>In the early nineteen-eighties, the authorities granted permission to rebuild Ze kha, Bya brang and gSer gzhong monasteries together as one monastery at the site of Bya brang Monastery in Bya brang village, where the main assembly hall (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">&rsquo;du khang</span>) had escaped destruction. However, since there was no longer enough land there to rebuild all three monasteries, Legs lung village was chosen as a new site. The site is located in Drongtsa (&rsquo;Brong tsha) valley, 2 km east of the The bo county seat. The mountain behind the monastery (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">rgyab ri</span>) is part of the sTag sgang range. The monastery, nestled in the mountain, is situated on the north bank of the eastward flowing &rsquo;Brug chu river and faces south (latitude: 34&deg;02&rsquo;93&rdquo;N, longitude: 103&deg;15&rsquo;22&rdquo;E).</p> <p>The original site of Ze kha monastery (latitude: 34&deg;02&rsquo;41&rdquo;N, longitude: 103&deg;14&rsquo;67&rdquo;E) is located 1 km northeast.</p> <p>The original site of Bya brang Monastery is located 2 km east of county town on the opposite river bank (latitude: 34&deg;02&rsquo;27&rdquo;N, longitude: 103&deg;15&rsquo;35&rdquo;E).</p> <p>The original site of gSer gzhong Monastery (latitude: 34&deg;35&rsquo;45&rdquo;N, longitude: 103&deg;30&rsquo;27&rdquo;E) is located 5 km east of county town on the north bank of the river.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-1-3-3\">3. History</h4> <p>According to oral tradition, the three brothers and great Bonpo masters Do &rsquo;phags chen mo, sKyang &rsquo;phags Nyi ma rgyal mtshan and gTso &rsquo;phags Zla ba rgyal mtshan came to Amdo to spread the Bon doctrine. They &ldquo;opened&rdquo; many hermitages (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">ri khrod</span>), some of which later became monasteries (for instance, sNang zhig Monastery No. 180, one of the largest Bonpo monasteries in Tibet, was originally a hermitage founded by Do &rsquo;phags chen mo). The three masters played a key role in the first spread of Bon in Amdo. There are descendents of gTso still living in The bo, Khri ka, Shar khog (=Zung chu) and rGan rgya in Amdo. Kyang za Yig rtsis ma, the mother of the three masters, also a fervent Bonpo, established her main residence at a site known as dGu skyang. gTso &rsquo;phags Zla ba rgyal mtshan is believed to have travelled extensively throughout the area, actively spreading the Bon religion. Although he founded only a number of sacred sites (and no monastery), he made a profound impression on the local culture and traditions. One of his mother&rsquo;s sacred sites and his main ritual and cremation sites are located at Chu gter rdzong, on Brag dkar bya rgod, a sacred mountain (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">gnas ri</span>) in Amdo. The first Bonpo monasteries were founded much later (only four to five generations ago) by gTso &rsquo;phags&rsquo;s descendents. At present the remaining known descendents of gTso &rsquo;phags live in the three villages that are financing the reconstruction of the three monasteries. Five of the families live in Ra nang village which is responsible for Ze kha Monastery, four in Bya brang village which is responsible for Bya brang Monastery, and two in gSer gzhong village which is responsible for gSer gzhong Monastery. There is no doubt that the &rsquo;Phags pa rnams gsum were lay people and that their religious tradition was permeated by indigenous customs and beliefs. However, the monasteries - which emerged much later - seem to have been strongly influenced by Buddhism.</p> <p>Since gTso tshang Monastery in fact comprises three monasteries - Ze kha, Bya brang, and gSer gzhong - it is important to mention here the information concerning their respective historical backgrounds.</p> <h5 id=\"b6-1-3-3-1\"> <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">Ze kha</span> </h5> <p>The date of Ze kha Monastery&rsquo;s foundation and the identity of its founder remain obscure; even A skal, the only surviving monk who has some knowledge on the history of gTso tshang and who wrote the only historical account of the monastery (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">TGLG</span>) is uncertain. The first master of Ze kha Monastery, Shar ba khri skyang, was born in sTod mtsho &rsquo;phel into one of the three Khri skyang villages of Zung chu County in rNga ba Prefecture; the second master was born in rGya myi ya ru (the exact location of which remains unknown). The third master was born in En &rsquo;dzin mtsho &rsquo;dus. During his lifetime the monastery&rsquo;s assembly hall was destroyed by fire and rebuilt. He travelled to Central Tibet and Khams. He was renowned as a saint, and was believed to be endowed with miraculous powers (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">grub rtags</span>); He is said to have founded the monastery&rsquo;s <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">&rsquo;cham</span> (monastic dance). The fourth master remains unidentified. The fifth, Bla ma skyabs, was born in lDong ba village of Brag sgom ba; his father was called A dam and his mother Klu mo. He broke his religious vows, so three influential monks of Ze kha - Dran pa skyabs, bSod nams dar rgyas and A rdo - invited Tshul khrims rgyal mtshan, a descendent of Do &rsquo;phags chen po, then aged five, from rNga khog to take his place in 1930. However, the new incumbent also broke his vows when he turned twenty-five, and was replaced by his brother Bon slebs Nam mkha&rsquo; bstan &rsquo;dzin, the present master of gTso tshang Monastery. Before 1958, Ze kha Monastery comprised a two storey assembly hall with five rooms on each floor, a common house (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">spyi khang</span>) with nine rooms and a two-storey building with five rooms called rNga sgra khang. According to oral tradition, the monastery was built on the site of an ancient Chinese Han fort.</p> <h5 id=\"b6-1-3-3-2\"> <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">Bya brang</span> </h5> <p>Although the real name of Bya brang Monastery&rsquo;s first lama remains unknown, he was locally known as gSer so can and was born in dGu skyang. According to oral tradition, he left dGu skyang with a retinue in search of an auspicious place to build a monastery. Disappointed by the first two sites where he expected to receive some favourable omen, he continued his search. As he was passing through a place called Nags &rsquo;bul beyond Tsha bzo mountain, he came upon a dead body which turned out to be that of the son of the A bze village chief who had been killed by a gang of robbers. He covered up the corpse, left his favourite dog behind to guard the corpse, and went to look for the deceased man&rsquo;s father. He eventually met the chief and his entourage who were looking for the son. The chief, moved by the Lama&rsquo;s solicitude for his dead son, requested him to become his spiritual master and offered him land on which to build the monastery, as well as fields and an estate to support it. The chosen site was known as Bya brang (&ldquo;Bird&rsquo;s chest&rdquo;) because of its garuda-like shape. gSer so can accepted the offer and thus Bya brang Monastery was built. His successor and incarnation was born in Mar sgur village not far from the monastery. Not much is known about the third incarnation except that he too was born in Mar sgur. However there are many fantastical tales relating his miraculous deeds circulating among the local Bonpo community. The fourth incarnation was born in En &rsquo;dzi&rsquo;i snya bza&rsquo;. The fifth was born in 1918, and his father was Klu &rsquo;bum bsod nams. He studied under Hor btsun bsTan &rsquo;dzin blo gros and obtained the Rab &rsquo;byams pa degree at gYung drung gling Monastery (No.2), and thus acquired a reputation as a learned lama. He built a new assembly hall. He died in 1958 at gYung drung gling. Before 1958, the monastery comprised a new assembly hall built of wood with five rooms on each floor, and a two-storey common house (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">spyi khang</span>) with five rooms on each floor, likewise built of wood.</p> <h5 id=\"b6-1-3-3-3\"> <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">gSer gzhong </span> </h5> <p>The first master of gSer gzhong Monastery, a descendent of gTso &rsquo;phags called Thor cog can, arrived from Dwang ra in the North to look for a place to build a monastery. He stopped at the site of gSer gzhong one night to rest and dreamt that a fox had stolen one of his boots, thus preventing him from travelling further. However, he found the fox&rsquo;s den with his boot inside. Thor cog can took this as a favourable omen and decided to build the monastery there. Its construction was financed by A nag dbang chen and gShen tsha glang thar. </p> <p>Thor cog can&rsquo;s reincarnation was born in sTag ri snya nang. The following incarnation and third lama of the monastery was born in En &rsquo;dzi&rsquo;i nyin ri. The fourth, Shes rab bstan &rsquo;dzin was born at sGang ri kha in 1907 and was enthroned at the age of six. He studied under Kun bzang tshang from sNang zhig in The bo and later went himself to sNang zhig to further his studies. He also travelled to central Tibet with an entourage. On the way, at Sog sde in Nag chu kha, he subdued a demon, a feat which earned him considerable fame and popularity. After spending three years at gYung drung gling and seven years at Grwa sa &rsquo;og ma i.e. sTag rtse ri khrod in Kong po to study and collect funds for the monasteries, he returned to The bo where he died in 1954 at the age of forty-seven. </p> <p>Another incarnation of the same lama was born almost at the same time, in 1916. His father was named Klu &rsquo;bum and his mother gNam sman &rsquo;tsho. He was enthroned at the age of twelve and his appointed tutor (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">yongs &rsquo;dzin</span>) was Tshe dbang shes rab. He left the monastery at a young age to search for his own spiritual teacher and whom he found in the person of bSe ba drung ram pa Shes rab phun tshogs at sKyang tshang Monastery (No. 202). He studied and practised assiduously for many years until his master&rsquo;s death, after which he returned to The bo where he spent four years at bDe gsal ri khrod, a hermitage he had founded. He then travelled to Central Tibet with two students via rKyang phyag. There is a record of all the Bonpo and Buddhist monasteries and sacred sites of Amdo, Khams, gTsang, dBus, Nag chu kha, mNga&rsquo; ris which he visited on his way. He also studied under Shar rdza bKra shis rgyal mtshan for two years. While in Central Tibet, he made a three-year retreat to practise the secret Ma rgyud tantra in a cave at lHa ri gyang tho where King dMu khri btsan po is said to have practised the sPyi spungs tantra of the Bon religion. A message from his monastery informing him of a disaster and requesting him to return drew him from his retreat. Back in The bo he chose to stay at the hermitage which he had recently established and not at his residence in the monastery. He became renowned throughout the area as an outstanding lama. He died in 1958 in Cone. </p> <p>In addition to the above-mentioned lamas of the main lineage, there are many other famous masters and practitioners whose stories are well known by the local population. Before 1958, the monastery comprised a three-storey assembly hall with seven rooms on each floor, a three-room sgrub khang and a five-room <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">spyi khang</span>, all built of wood.</p> <p>In the early nineteen-eighties, the elder monks from all three monasteries gathered to discuss how to rebuild the three monasteries together (permission was granted for only one monastery). They sought the advice of Bon slebs Nam mkha&rsquo; bstan &rsquo;dzin, the head lama of Ze kha at the time, and requested him to supervise the reconstruction of gTso tshang Monastery. The new assembly hall has twelve pillars. The most sacred objects within are a statue of sTon pa gShen rab which was discovered by dBal khyung sMon lam rgyal mtshan at gNas chen gSang ba yang rdzong, and brought to the monastery by Bon lsebs Nam mkha&rsquo; bstan &rsquo;dzin.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-1-3-4\">4.

Current education</h4> <p>At first A skal only taught the young monks reading and reciting. Later he began to teach a little grammar from texts such as the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">Sum bcu pa</span> and <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">rTags &rsquo;jug</span>.

Occupation of the local people </h4> <p>Farmers, who, in the past, were organized into military units (see above section). A wide variety of crops grow in the valley - wheat, barley, beans, potatos, peas, and maize. Most of the farmers also keep animals of some kind - cows, horses, donkeys, mules, sheep and goats. </p> <h4 id=\"b6-1-3-13\">Sources</h4> <h5 id=\"b6-1-3-13-1\">(1) Interviews</h5> <p>Interviews with A skal and sTag tsha Kun grol on 26 August 1996 at the monastery.

Name</h4> <p>There used to be a Bonpo monastery called Bya &rsquo;bab gser thang whose foundation date and founder remain unknown, and which, according to oral tradition, was forcefully converted to Buddhism, together with many other Bonpo monasteries, when the Cone Chief conquered The bo (probably during the time of Tshe dbang don grub (1642-1692), the ninth chief of Cone and Blo bzang don grub, (?-1692), his successor (See <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">DMCB</span>, pp.661-663; <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">CNTK</span>, pp.372-373; <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">ZNYZ</span>, pp.41-55). Several monks, unwilling to submit, fled from the monastery and built a new Bonpo monastery. Because they were considered rgod po &ldquo;brave people&rdquo;, the new monastery was called rGod po.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-1-4-2\">2. Location</h4> <p>rGod po Monastery is located in La rtsa khog district. The seat of the district is mKhar steng, 95 km east of county town. The La rtsa chu is a small northward-flowing tributary of The bo river. rGod po Monastery is located in Chas ra village, on the east bank of the La rtsa chu, around 120 km from the county town, the seat of The bo county (latitude 34&deg;08&rsquo;02&rdquo;N, longitude 103&deg;55&rsquo;41&rdquo;E).</p> <h4 id=\"b6-1-4-3\">3. History</h4> <p>Two articles written in Tibetan without any references to their Sources say that the monastery was built in ca. 1770 by gYung drung bstan &rsquo;dzin, and that the first lama of the monastery was born in mKhar steng village and was known as mKhar steng Lama. His reincarnation was discovered twenty years after his death. There were two assembly halls and sixty-three cells accomodating seventy-five monks in the first half of the twentieth century (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">DBSJ</span>, p.101; <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">TLPY</span>, pp.69-70). According to oral tradition, a Lama from Shar khog rebuilt the monastery at the present site after the monastery was destroyed by monks from a Buddhist monastery in mKhar steng when the lama of rGod po was still a child. At present the monastery is in a state of disrepair. </p> <h4 id=\"b6-1-4-4\">7. Educational exchange</h4> <p>rGod po was a branch of gSer gzhong Monastery. </p> <h4 id=\"b6-1-4-5\">12.

Name </h4> <p>The monastery&rsquo;s real name is bSam &rsquo;grub, but since it is located at the foot of Nags gong village it is locally known as Nags gong or Nags gong bSam &rsquo;grub dgon.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-1-5-2\">2. Location</h4> <p>Nags gong Monastery is located on north bank of the &rsquo;A zha river in &rsquo;A zha valley, about 90 km southeast of the county town (latitude: 33&deg;48&rsquo;18&rdquo;N, longitude 103&deg;41&rsquo;58&rdquo;E).</p> <h4 id=\"b6-1-5-3\">3. History</h4> <p>The monastery was founded in ca. 875 A.D. by sKyang &rsquo;phags Nyi ma rgyal &rsquo;mtshan and is now a branch monastery of dGu skyang Monastery (No.196), the main seat of dGu skyang Nyi ma rgyal mtshan. Prior to 1959, the monastery comprised one assembly hall, and living quarters consisting of thirty-nine cells accomodating fifty monks (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">DBSJ</span>, p.101; <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">TLPY,</span> p.69). It was rebuilt in 1991. At present it comprises one assembly hall, the residence of the head lama, and ten cells.</p> <p>When I visited the monastery, the assembly hall was under construction, but all the monks were away performing a ritual at a private home. I found the head lama of the monastery in Pe gseb village. He was born in 1968. He is not considered an incarnation but was chosen a few years ago by the monks. Since he has been busy with rebuilding the monastery, he has had little time to study and knows almost nothing of the monastery&rsquo;s history, even though he is considered the most learned person in the area.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-1-5-4\">5. Current number of monks </h4> <p>The monastery has twelve monks, five or six of whom live outside the monastery with their families.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-1-5-5\">6. Current education</h4> <p>The head of the monastery is a young monk called bSod nams ye she. Since all the monks are very young, they study mainly Tibetan and ritual practice under the head master.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-1-5-6\">8 / 9. Rituals </h4> <p>The monks go to dGu skyang to perform the <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">&rsquo;cham</span> dance with the monks there on the 13th day of the 3rd month. Occasionally, they also perform funerary rites and rituals for health, fortune, abundant crops etc, in private homes at the behest of the families. </p> <h4 id=\"b6-1-5-7\">12. Local community</h4> <p>The local lay community of the monastery consists of five villages: Nags gong with twenty families, Pe gseb with thirty-eight families, Gro mang with twenty-two families, dNgul ba with twelve families and sTag dpung with ten families (one hundred and three people in total).</p> <h4 id=\"b6-1-5-8\">14.

History</h4> <p>The monastery was founded by a chief of the mGo rje village named Tshe lung (or Tshe lhun) in ca. 1868. It was moved to another site but because of some sort of threat to the monks&rsquo; lives, the monastery was moved back to its original site. Later, another disaster occured: three of the monks held up three horses belonging to the chief of Cone for reasons that remain unexplained. The chief of Cone retaliated by burning down the monastery. There is little information concerning the monastery&rsquo;s history besides the fact that it was connected to A skyid sKyang tshang Monastery (No.194) in mDzod dge, and for this reason a monk of sKyang tshang called Dri med &rsquo;od zer undertook the reconstruction of the monastery in 1993. </p> <h4 id=\"b6-1-6-4\">5. Current number of monks</h4> <p>At present there are thirty-two and novices monks living in the monastery. As head of the monastery, Dri med &rsquo;od zer visits the site every year to inspect the reconstruction work and perform rituals. </p> <h4 id=\"b6-1-6-5\">7. Educational exchange</h4> <p>sKyang tshang Monastery of which it is a branch.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-1-6-6\">12.

Name</h4> <p>The monastery was originally named Khis ri after an old village, but later it came to be known as Shing skam Monastery, the name of the village where it was located. The name is only known by its pronunciation and thus its exact meaning remains obscure. Shing skam in Tibetan, if spelt the way it is pronounced, literally means &ldquo;dead tree&rdquo;; this interpretation corresponds to one legend according to which the monastery was built on a site where many trees died. The monastery is also known as Kha ba lung, since it is situated in Kha ba lung.</p> <p>The local Bonpo community simply calls it Kha ba lung, but it should not be confused with the Buddhist monastery of the same name in the vicinity. To distinguish them, the Buddhist monastery, which is located above the village, is referred to as Kha ba lung dgon pa gong ma (upper Kha ba lung Monastery) and the Bonpo monastery, which is located at the bottom of the village, as Kha ba lung dgon pa &rsquo;gab ma (lower Kha ba lung Monastery) (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">&rsquo;gab ma</span> has the same meaning as <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">zhol ma</span> in Amdo dialect). Some people also refer to the monastery as Shel sgo dgon pa because it was the first monastery in the valley to have its windows fitted with glass panes.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-1-7-2\">2. Location</h4> <p>Shing skam Monastery was situated near the Kha ba village of Kha ba district (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">xiang</span>), located 34 km east of county town, the seat The bo County (latitude: 33&deg;58&rsquo;78&rdquo;N, longitude: 103&deg;29&rsquo;66&rdquo;E).</p> <h4 id=\"b6-1-7-3\">3.

The original monastery was located on a slope in En &rsquo;dzi valley near a Buddhist monastery. It was later moved by Tso ke don grub, the village chief, to its present site near the village because its original location was too remote and made it an easy target for thieves. The monastery was destroyed in 1958 and so far has not been rebuilt nor has the reincarnation of its trulku been found. At present, the local Bonpo community goes to other Bonpo monasteries in the area. </p> <p>The monastery&rsquo;s lineage of masters ran for at least four generations, since the names of four of the masters are mentioned: Nyi ma, A gsas, Blo bzang and rDo rje (<span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">DBSJ</span>, p.100; <span xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" class=\"\">TLPY</span>, pp.65-66). </p> <h4 id=\"b6-1-7-4\">12.

History</h4> <p>Three lamas, Shes rab dbang phyug, rGyal mtshan and Nya le bla ma, from three different hermitages, came together and founded bSam &rsquo;grub Monastery in ca. 1395. It is not clear how and when this occurred but the monastery is affiliated to A skyid sKyang tshang Monastery (No.194) in mDzod dge. Until the nineteen-fifties the monastery comprised an assembly hall, thirty-three cells, and housed seventy-seven monks. The monastery had a series of masters as follows:</p> <ol type=\"1\"> <li> rGyal ba, from Myi che ba village, he was also the lama of another Bonpo monastery called Shes rab Monastery. </li> <li> Chos &rsquo;byor rgyal ba </li> <li> bSam gtan rgyal ba</li> <li> Shes rab dngos grub </li> <li> Nya len Bla ma </li> <li> rGyal mtshan of Myi che ba village</li> <li> Nam mkha&rsquo; rgyal mtshan</li> <li> Tshul khrims rgyal mtshan from Nyin srib village at sTeng ka in The bo, travelled to Central Tibet to receive teachings and then returned to secular life in Kong po </li> <li> A monk of the Myi che ba village, name is unknown. </li> <li> Rin chen nor bu of Myi che ba village </li> <li> Ye shes tshul khrims of Mi rgod kha village</li> <li> bsTan &rsquo;dzin dbang rgyal of Myi che ba village; he travelled twice to Central Tibet to study and receive teachings, and became a renowned teacher when he returned to the monastery. </li> <li> sKal bzang &rsquo;jam dpal of Myi che ba village; according to legend, he went to Lhasa, India and Hongkong to study, and was renowned as a sculptor. </li> <li> dNgos grub tshogs pa of Nya len pa village, was a renowned teacher and artist (he executed the murals in the previous assemly hall).
