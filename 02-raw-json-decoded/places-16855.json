The site rises above the west shore of <span class=\"popular\">Yubuk Tsakha</span><span class=\"scholar\">G.yu sbug tshwa kha</span> (4560 m), a salt lake that greatly expands and shrinks in size. The presence of tombs and many petroglyphs (I-15) along the west side of the lake indicate that it has long been the focus of human settlement, despite being situated so far north. The relatively low elevation of the <span class=\"popular\">Yubuk Tsakha</span><span class=\"scholar\">G.yu sbug tshwa kha</span> basin and the 6000-m high meridian range to the west, providing ample fresh water, are the main geographic endowments accounting for this settlement. Although <span class=\"popular\">Gyaruk M&ouml;ndur</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rgya rug mon dur</span> has been classed as a type II.3 monument (due to its ridge-top aspect), it has little resemblance to the average cubic tombs of this typology. <span class=\"popular\">Gyaruk M&ouml;ndur</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rgya rug mon dur</span> is perhaps better classed as a type II.2 monument, but he in situ evidence does not permit a detailed analysis of its design and construction. Stones of various colors and lengths (up to 90 cm long) went into the construction of <span class=\"popular\">Gyaruk M&ouml;ndur</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rgya rug mon dur</span>.</p> <h4 id=\"b2-3-11-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>According to local residents, <span class=\"popular\">Gyaruk M&ouml;ndur</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rgya rug mon dur</span> belonged to the ancient <span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span>. </p> <h4 id=\"b2-3-11-4\">Site elements</h4> <h5 id=\"b2-3-11-4-1\">Funerary Structure FS1</h5> <p>Funerary structure FS1 is situated in the middle of a fairly level ridge-top (32&deg; 58.534&#900; N. lat. / 86&deg; 38.954&#900; E. long. / 4650 m). It has morphological characteristics of both the double-course enclosure (II.1b) type and <span class=\"popular emph\">bangso</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">bang so</span> (II.2d) type of funerary structures, but its precise design could not be ascertained. This dissolute structure (8 m x 8 m) is elevated 1 m to 1.4 m above ground level. Small intact wall fragments suggest that it was square in shape, although it now has a round appearance. The center of FS1 appears to have been open, but dislodged stones are now scattered all around the structure. </p> <h5 id=\"b2-3-11-4-2\">Funerary Structure FS2</h5> <p>Funerary structure FS2 is located higher up the same ridgeback on a relatively broad and level portion of the summit (58.704 &#900; / 38.450&#900; / 4770 m). It is of similar construction to FS1. We might speculate that FS2 consisted of a central mound enclosed by a wall. Small traces of double-course walls make up the perimeter of his probable quadrate structure (11 m x 11 m). FS2 is elevated 1.2 m to 1.6 m above the summit. The construction of a shepherd&rsquo;s shelter (<span class=\"popular emph\">droklh&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">&rsquo;brog lhas</span>) in the middle adds another 50 cm to the height of FS2. This concave rock shelter is measures 2.3 m across and 1 m in depth. </p> <h4 id=\"b2-3-11-5\">Affiliated sites</h4> <h5 id=\"b2-3-11-5-1\">sNgon gdong</h5> <p>Two funerary structures are found at a locale called <span class=\"popular\">Ng&ouml;ndong</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sngon gdong</span> (Blue Face), situated northwest of<span class=\"popular\">Yubuk Tsakha</span><span class=\"scholar\">G.yu sbug tshwa kha</span>. </p> <h6 class=\"essay\">Funerary Structure FS1</h6> <p>Funerary structure FS1 is a sub-rectangular double-course (6 m x 6 m) enclosure situated in the middle of the boulder-strewn slopes of <span class=\"popular\">Ng&ouml;ndong</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sngon gdong</span> (33&deg; 01. 565&#900; N. lat. / 86&deg; 40.225&#900; / 4690 m). More than 50 percent of its 50-cm thick walls are intact. The variable-length (primarily 30 cm to 50 cm long) stones in these walls are mostly flush with the ground surface. There are also at least two slabs in the walls, projecting 25 cm above ground level. </p> <h6 class=\"essay\">Funerary Structure FS2</h6> <p>Funerary structure FS2 is situated on a rocky shoulder, overlooking the south side of <span class=\"popular\">Ng&ouml;ndong</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sngon gdong</span> (01.346&#900; / 40.174&#900; / 4680 m). This structure now has the appearance of a rocky tumulus, elevated 70 cm above the surrounding terrain. The faint remaining wall fragments of this probable quadrate structure appear to be aligned in the cardinal directions. They contain variable-length stones. FS2 measures 2.8 m (north-south) x 3.7 m (east-west). Horns of domestic sheep and goats have been placed on the ruins of FS2, probably in the mistaken belief that a <span class=\"popular emph\">Ch&ouml;rten</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mchod rten</span> once stood here. For instance, the local guide to the site is under the impression that FS2 represents the base of an old <span class=\"popular emph\">Ch&ouml;rten</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mchod rten</span>. </p> <h5 id=\"b2-3-11-5-2\">Rong rde&rsquo;u dkar po</h5> <p>It is reported that several kilometers north of sngon gdong, at a locale called <span class=\"popular\">Rongdeu Karpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rong rde&rsquo;u dkar po</span> (White Valley Knoll), a &lsquo;<span class=\"popular emph\">m&ouml;n dur</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mon dur</span>&rsquo; of the enclosure type was excavated in the search for valuables (sometime before this survey). Digging down into the middle of the enclosure, the leg joints and hornless skull of a blue sheep are said to have been discovered but nothing else. </p> <h5 id=\"b2-3-11-5-3\">Khrog shar ma</h5> <p>What appears to be a minor funerary structure was detected in the pastoral hamlet of <span class=\"popular\">Troksharma</span><span class=\"scholar\">Khrog shar ma</span>, in 2006 (33&deg; 01.512&#900; N. lat . / 86&deg; 06.473&#900; E. long. / 4880). This site is in rgo mo township, <span class=\"popular\">Gerts&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sger rtse</span> county. The terrain is sandy, level and open. This squarish enclosure (1.1 m x 1.3 m) has single-course perimeter walls, which are mostly made up of nine blue-gray grained stones. These upright stones are up to 60 cm in length and project as much as 25 cm above the ground surface. There is also one section of the perimeter wall that is composed of small pieces of milky quartz, a highly unusual feature.</p> <table cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\" class=\"navarrows\"> <tbody> <tr> <td class=\"leftcell\"> <a class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-left.gif\" title=\"Previous Section\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"midcell\"> <a class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-up.gif\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"rightcell\"> <a class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-right.gif\" title=\"Next Section\"/> </a> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div id=\"chap-id\">/bellezza2/b2-3-11/</div> <div style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\" class=\"jqmWindow\" id=\"chapRefWindow\"> <div class=\"closebtn\"> <a href=\"#\">Close</a> </div> <div style=\"height: 280px;\" class=\"conx-content\"> <h3>Note Citation for Page <span class=\"pgnm\"/> </h3> <p class=\"biblref\">John Vincent Bellezza, Antiquities of Zhang Zhung: A Comprehensive Inventory of Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Monuments on he Tibetan Upland (Charlottesville, VA 22904:Tibetan &amp; Himalayan Library, 2010), <span class=\"pgnm\"/>. </p> <h3>Bibliographic Citation</h3> <p>John Vincent Bellezza.
