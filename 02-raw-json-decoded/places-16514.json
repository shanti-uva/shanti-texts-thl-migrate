The parent hill is on the right bank of the <span class=\"popular\">Maja Tsangpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rma bya gtsang po</span> (Karnali river). According to the Bon radition, a fortress on the hilltop was founded in the prehistoric <span class=\"popular\">Zhang Zhung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Zhang zhung</span> period.<a href=\"#n40\" name=\"nb40\" class=\"note\">40</a> This hill, known as <span class=\"popular\">Men Gi Gyelmo Takri Rong</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sman gyi rgyal mo stag ri rong</span> (Queen of the <span class=\"popular emph\">men</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">sman</span> Tiger Hill Valley), also hosted he <span class=\"popular emph\">gelukpa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">dge lugs pa</span> monastery of <span class=\"popular\">Shenpel Ling</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bshad &rsquo;phel gling</span>, as well as an earlier monastery belonging to the <span class=\"popular emph\">sakya</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">sa skya </span>sect. This same hill also supported the old Tibetan government (<span class=\"popular emph\">Ganden Podrang Sizhung</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">dga&rsquo; ldan pho brang srid gzhung</span>) headquarters (<span class=\"popular emph\">dzong</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rdzong</span>) of <span class=\"popular\">Purang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Spu rang</span>. Verification of the cultural identity of structures attributed to prehistoric <span class=\"popular\">Zhang Zhung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Zhang zhung</span> was not possible. Its morphological and design characteristics vary little from those exhibited by the <span class=\"popular emph\">sakyapa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">sa skya pa</span> monastery. Nevertheless, the strategic location of the <span class=\"popular\">Men Gi Gyelmo Takri Rong</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sman gyi rgyal mo stag ri rong</span> hilltop near a main river confluence, in western Tibet&rsquo;s largest agricultural enclave and the paucity of contending strongholds, lend credence to the literary and oral traditions attributing an archaic cultural monument to this location. </p> <h4 id=\"b1-1-33-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>A single earthen wall segment of the prehistoric epoch stands on the summit of the <span class=\"popular\">Takla Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Stag la mkhar</span> hill. In the local oral tradition, this castle is variously called <span class=\"popular\">Taklha Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Stag lha mkhar</span> (Tiger God Castle) and <span class=\"popular\">Takmo Ritra Taklha Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Stag mo ris bkra stag lha mkhar</span> (Female Striped Tiger Tiger God Castle).</p> <h4 id=\"b1-1-33-4\">Site elements</h4> <h5 id=\"b1-1-33-4-1\">Zhang zhung fortress</h5> <p>The hill of <span class=\"popular\">Men Gi Gyelmo Takri Rong</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sman gyi rgyal mo stag ri rong</span> rises to the west until, at its highest point, it is suspended above the old Buddhist monasteries. On the 15-m wide summit there is a highly eroded V-shaped rammed-earth wall, 15 m in length, a maximum of 1 m thick and approximately 6 m high. The mouth of the &lsquo;V&rsquo; is 5 m wide. There are, more or less, 12 horizontal rows of orifices in this wall, in which pins used to hold the shuttering in place during construction were inserted. Capping many of these orifices is a stone in the wall and in some places adobe blocks. The walls of the ruined <span class=\"popular\">sakya</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sa skya</span> monastery are constructed in a similar fashion, while those of <span class=\"popular\">Shenpel Ling</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bshad &rsquo;phel gling</span> are much less weathered, contain far fewer orifices and only average 40 cm to 60 cm in thickness. In addition to the landmark wall segment, there is cobble building rubble on the summit. This rubble is scattered west and south of the summit. Faint traces of another wall are found on the steep south flank of the summit. </p> <h5 id=\"b1-1-33-4-2\">Cave complex</h5> <p>Immediately north of <span class=\"popular\">Men Gi Gyelmo Takri Rong</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sman gyi rgyal mo stag ri rong</span> there is a south facing cave complex with around 40 individual caves. These evidently were used by Buddhist religious practitioners, because there are many <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma &#7751;i</span> mantras carved on the cliff face and among the domiciliary remains. </p> <hr class=\"footnote-divider\"/> <h2>Notes</h2> <div class=\"footnote\"> <a name=\"n40\"/> <a href=\"#nb40\" class=\"note\"> [40] </a> See Bellezza, &ldquo;Territorial Characteristics of the Archaic Zhang-zhung&rdquo; for an analysis of the pre-Buddhist status of the site. </div> <table cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\" class=\"navarrows\"> <tbody> <tr> <td class=\"leftcell\"> <a class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-left.gif\" title=\"Previous Section\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"midcell\"> <a class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-up.gif\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"rightcell\"> <a class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-right.gif\" title=\"Next Section\"/> </a> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div id=\"chap-id\">/bellezza/b1-1-33/</div> <div style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\" class=\"jqmWindow\" id=\"chapRefWindow\"> <div class=\"closebtn\"> <a href=\"#\">Close</a> </div> <div style=\"height: 280px;\" class=\"conx-content\"> <h3>Note Citation for Page <span class=\"pgnm\"/> </h3> <p class=\"biblref\">John Vincent Bellezza, Antiquities of Zhang Zhung: A Comprehensive Inventory of Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Monuments on he Tibetan Upland (Charlottesville, VA 22904:Tibetan &amp; Himalayan Library, 2010), <span class=\"pgnm\"/>. </p> <h3>Bibliographic Citation</h3> <p>John Vincent Bellezza.
