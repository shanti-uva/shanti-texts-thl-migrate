If summit facilities were located at this site they are no longer visible from below. There are over 20 caves in the west-facing vertical formation. Virtually all of the caves have lost substantial parts of their fronts due to slope failure and erosion. Arable land that was recently brought back under cultivation is found in he valley below the site. It would appear that the caves represent an ancient troglodytic settlement that likely had an agrarian economic base. The habitation function is borne out by the niches and bays hewn into certain caves. It may be that <span class=\"popular\">Rak Khashak M&ouml;n Gi Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rag kha shag mon gyi mkhar</span> was active in the same period as the cave settlements of <span class=\"popular\">Rakkha Shak</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rag kha shag</span> (A-114), which appear to represent a larger and more desirable locus of settlement. By following a series of extremely narrow ledges, it is possible to reach the midpoint of the cave complex. At this level, on the prow of the formation, there is a wall approximately 20 m in length and 1 m in height enclosing a natural shelf. It is made of natural earthen slabs cut from the formation and has two cobble vertical courses laid diagonally at its base. Caves and a walled ledge situated at higher elevation are no longer approachable. </p> <h4 id=\"b1-1-66-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>According to local sources, <span class=\"popular\">Rak Khashak M&ouml;n Gi Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rag kha shag mon gyi mkhar</span> was an ancient castle of the <span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span>. </p> <table cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\" class=\"navarrows\"> <tbody> <tr> <td class=\"leftcell\"> <a class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-left.gif\" title=\"Previous Section\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"midcell\"> <a class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-up.gif\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"rightcell\"> <a class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-right.gif\" title=\"Next Section\"/> </a> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div id=\"chap-id\">/bellezza/b1-1-66/</div> <div style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\" class=\"jqmWindow\" id=\"chapRefWindow\"> <div class=\"closebtn\"> <a href=\"#\">Close</a> </div> <div style=\"height: 280px;\" class=\"conx-content\"> <h3>Note Citation for Page <span class=\"pgnm\"/> </h3> <p class=\"biblref\">John Vincent Bellezza, Antiquities of Zhang Zhung: A Comprehensive Inventory of Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Monuments on he Tibetan Upland (Charlottesville, VA 22904:Tibetan &amp; Himalayan Library, 2010), <span class=\"pgnm\"/>. </p> <h3>Bibliographic Citation</h3> <p>John Vincent Bellezza.
