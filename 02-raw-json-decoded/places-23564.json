Name</h4> <p>The full name of the monastery is rBa mda&rsquo; bDe chen bsam gtan gling. There is a valley called rBa lung pa, and according to legend, three Indian saints lived in the valley and worshipped a self-manifested stone statue of Vajrapani (Phyag rdor) within a cave in the upper reaches of the valley. One day they forgot their rattan (rba dbyug, &ldquo;walking staffs&rdquo;) there, so the valley was named rBa dbyug bor ba&rsquo;i lung pa, &ldquo;the valley of the lost rattan&rdquo;; mda&rsquo; means the lower reaches of the valley, thus rBa mda&rsquo; meaning &ldquo;Lower rBa valley&rdquo;.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-8-9-2\">2. Location</h4> <p>The monastery is 23 km north of the county town of Brag mgo.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-8-9-3\">3. History</h4> <p>There are no reliable records concerning the history of the monastery. I found only a brief history<a href=\"#n26\" name=\"nb26\" class=\"note\">26</a> containing legendary accounts according to which a Bonpo master called rGya mda&rsquo; ri nang came to the sNyi khog valley and built the monastery in the middle of the 6th Rab byung (1327-1386), after having built Chu ring Monastery in Chu ring valley. Four generations later, bDud &rsquo;dul grags pa, the valley&rsquo;s chief, forced the monastery to move to sPang dmar. The new monastery was considerably enlarged to include a twenty-room assembly hall (&rsquo;du khang) and fifty monks&rsquo; cells housing more than a hundred monks. Then lHa lug tshul khrims moved the monastery to a site called Lug ge where it remained active for seven generations. The monastery was later moved again by Byang chub to gNas khog where it remained for only fifty years, then dBra sras Zla ba grags pa, a son of dBra sprul bsTan &rsquo;dzin dbang rgyal of rDza sTeng chen Monastery (No. 139) and a master of Shar rdza bKra shis rgyal mtshan (who wrote his biography) rebuilt it at bDe cha and named it bDe chen bsam gtan gling. At that time, it had an eighteen-room assembly hall and fifteen monks&rsquo; cells. He spent thirteen years at the monastery before &ldquo;passing away into his rainbow body&rdquo; (&rsquo;ja&rsquo; lus pa), at the beginning of the 20th century. Then Tshul khrims &rsquo;od zer (1910-1971) and rDo rje tshe dbang (1890-1962) who were disciples of dBra sras Zla ba grags pa were in charge of the monastery for more than forty years. Both were monks and had received teachings from Phun tshogs blo gros, the abbot of sMan ri Monastery (No.1) at the time. </p> <p>During the Cultural Revolution the monastery was knocked down and in the 1980s it was rebuilt with its twenty-five-room assembly hall and twenty-two monks&rsquo; cells by sPul sku Nam mkha&rsquo; &rsquo;od zer gzhan phan mtha&rsquo; yas (b.1937) and &rsquo;Jam dbyangs. </p> <p>sPul sku Nam mkha&rsquo; is the rebirth of Zla ba grags pa and at present in charge of the monastery. In addition to Bonpo teachings and practice, he learned Tibetan medicine and worked at Brag &rsquo;go Hospital of Tibetan Medicine for twelve years. </p> <h4 id=\"b6-8-9-4\">4.
