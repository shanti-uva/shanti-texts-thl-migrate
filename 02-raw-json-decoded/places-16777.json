The site enjoys a commanding location above the two river valleys and would have been a prominent geographic feature of ancient settlement at <span class=\"popular\">Trashi Gang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bkra shis sgang</span>. The terrain is sandy and rock-strewn. The site consists of five clusters of heaped-stone wall ovoid enclosures and one isolated specimen situated at two different locations. Each enclosure or cell measures 1.8 m to 5.5 m across. Variable-length (30 cm to 80 cm long) stones are piled up to a maximum height of 50 cm to 1 m. These heaped-stone walls originally may have been somewhat higher. It is possible that each cluster of ovoid cells were surrounded by an outer perimeter wall, but here is insufficient in situ structural evidence from which to make a positive determination. Some of the funerary superstructures at <span class=\"popular\">Ser Riri</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ser ris ris</span> were modified to create shepherd shelters or other types of structures. Some enclosures contain concavities up to 1 m deep. These appear to be signs of excavations carried out well in the past. Due to these disturbances, the clusters of cells at <span class=\"popular\">Ser Riri</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ser ris ris</span> are not very well preserved. </p> <h4 id=\"b2-2-25-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>According to inhabitants of <span class=\"popular\">Trashi Gang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bkra shis sgang</span> village, the structures of <span class=\"popular\">Ser Riri</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ser ris ris</span> are the ombs of the ancient <span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span>.</p> <h4 id=\"b2-2-25-4\">Site elements</h4> <h5 id=\"b2-2-25-4-1\">Lower site</h5> <p>The lower site is situated on a shelf that forms below the ridgeback. It is comprised of three clusters of enclosures or cells and one isolated cell in close proximity to one another (32&deg; 29.86&#900; N. lat. / 79&deg; 40.30&#900; E. long. / 4310 m): </p> <ol> <li>The south cluster (15.5 m x 5 m) appears to consist of four interconnected cells.</li> <li>Cluster 2 (21.5 m x 16 m) is situated 8 m north of the south cluster. It appears to consist of at least one dozen cells, including a number of small specimens measuring less than 2.5 m across. </li> <li>Cluster 3 (9 m x 8 m) is situated 4.5 m north of cluster 2. It appears to consist of three contiguous cells. The north cell (8 m x 5 m) is situated 11 m north of cluster 3. It appears to have consisted of just a single cell with a large depression in the center. Among its walls there is an east-west oriented line of seven large stones (50 cm to 80 cm long) embedded in the ground. </li> </ol> <h5 id=\"b2-2-25-4-2\">Upper site</h5> <p>The upper site is situated 110 m west of the lower site in a fairly level fold of the ridge (29.88&#900; / 40.217&#900; / 4340 m). The upper site is comprised of two clusters of cells:</p> <ol> <li>The east cluster (21 m x 16 m) consists of several cells, each measuring around 5 m across. Its south side is raised about 1 m above the surrounding terrain. In one of the cells there is a 1 m deep depression. </li> <li>The west cluster (12 m x 17 m) is situated 24 m west of the east cluster. It consists of a large central cell flanked by two smaller cells around 3 m across. At one time the central cell was excavated. One of the smaller cells is fairly intact while the other one is not.</li> </ol> <h4 id=\"b2-2-25-5\">Affiliated sites</h4> <h5 id=\"b2-2-25-5-1\">dGa&rsquo; ldan tshe dbang mkhar</h5> <p>Directly above the settlement of <span class=\"popular\">Trashi Gang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bkra shis sgang</span> there is a hill called <span class=\"popular\">Wuts&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dbu rtse</span> with a prayer flag mast on its summit (32&deg; 30.173&#900; N. lat. / 79&deg; 39.913&#900; E. long / 4380 m).<a href=\"#n62\" name=\"nb62\" class=\"note\">62</a> This is the location of <span class=\"popular\">Ganden Tsewang Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dga&rsquo; ldan tshe dbang mkhar</span>, a ruined multi-roomed residential complex (26 m x 7 m) and a couple of small outlying buildings. All structures have been reduced to their foundations or low-lying wall fragments. The 50-cm thick walls of this installation, which are not buttressed, could only have supported timber roofs. </p> <p>In all likelihood, the so-called <span class=\"popular\">Ganden Tsewang Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dga&rsquo; ldan tshe dbang mkhar</span> is an archaic cultural facility. Nevertheless, some residents of <span class=\"popular\">Trashi Gang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bkra shis sgang</span> hold that <span class=\"popular\">Ganden Tsewang Khar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dga&rsquo; ldan tshe dbang mkhar</span> was built by the famous general <span class=\"popular\">Ganden Tsewang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dga&rsquo; ldan tshe dbang</span> in his campaign against the <span class=\"popular\">Ladak</span><span class=\"scholar\">La dwags</span> <span/>army (he ousted the <span class=\"popular\">Ladakpa</span><span class=\"scholar\">La dwags pa</span> from <span class=\"popular\">Ngari Korsum</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mnga&rsquo; ris skor gsum</span> in 1680 CE). This oral tradition, however, appears to be apocryphal. As <span class=\"popular\">Ganden Tsewang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dga&rsquo; ldan tshe dbang</span> took control of the <span class=\"popular\">Trashi Gang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bkra shis sgang</span> and <span class=\"popular\">Tsarang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rtsa rang</span> citadels in 1680 CE,<a href=\"#n63\" name=\"nb63\" class=\"note\">63</a> there does not seem to be any strategic reason why he would build a much smaller garrison on the ridgeback above the <span class=\"popular\">Trashi Gang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bkra shis sgang</span> citadel. The construction of such an installation would not have been militarily feasible while the <span class=\"popular\">Ladak</span><span class=\"scholar\">La dwags</span>army was still in control of the <span class=\"popular\">Trashi Gang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bkra shis sgang</span> citadel and environs, and it would have been redundant after their conquest. The hidden ridge-top location of the site, the highly deteriorated condition of the ruins and their general morphological traits are more in keeping with the archaic cultural strongholds that dot the <span class=\"popular\">Gar Tsangpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sgar gtsang po</span> and <span class=\"popular\">Senge Tsangpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sengge gtsang po</span> valleys (see A-22, A-23, A-41, A-42, A-43, A-44, A-66, A-67, A-124, A-125, A-126). The ancient settlement pattern exhibited in this region is marked by the construction of a stronghold perched above each major agricultural enclave. <span class=\"popular\">Trashi Gang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bkra shis sgang</span>, one of these agrarian pockets, is likely to have experienced the same type of cultural occupation. </p> <h5 id=\"b2-2-25-5-2\">bKra shis sgang</h5> <p> <span class=\"popular\">Trashi Gang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bkra shis sgang</span> has extensive farmlands irrigated by the <span class=\"popular\">Miktrin Tsangpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mig sprin gtsang po</span>. According to a local elder, respected for his knowledge of history, named <span class=\"popular\">Rindzin Dorj&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rig &rsquo;dzin rdo rje</span> (born in the Iron Dog Year, circa 1934), the origins of agriculture at <span class=\"popular\">Trashi Gang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bkra shis sgang</span> can be raced back to the ancient <span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span>. The monastery of <span class=\"popular\">Trashi Gang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bkra shis sgang</span> was built inside the ruins of a large citadel situated on a small eminence in the <span class=\"popular\">Senge Tsangpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sengge gtsang po</span> valley. The massive rammed earth walls of the fortress are up to 1.3 m thick. These walls are long and straight, giving rise to a rectangular plan not unlike Moghul fortresses of north India. There are also a few stone and adobe-block walls of the old residential structures still intact. On the west end of the fortress there are F-shaped loopholes and the remains of two round defensive towers set outside the ramparts. The entire citadel appears to have been circumvallated. According to lama <span class=\"popular\">Khenrap</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mkhan rab</span> (born in the Snake Year, circa 1929), a native of <span class=\"popular\">Namrup&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gnam ru dpon</span>, and the senior-most monk at <span class=\"popular\">Trashi Gang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bkra shis sgang</span>, the monastery was under the authority of the abbot of <span class=\"popular\">Sera Je</span><span class=\"scholar\">Se ra rje</span> in Lhasa. The first <span class=\"popular emph\">gelukpa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">dge lugs pa</span> abbot was <span class=\"popular\">Ngakwang Chokden</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ngag dbang mchog ldan</span>, a teacher of the seventh Dalai Lama. Also, according to lama <span class=\"popular\">Khenrap</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mkhan rab</span>, before the time of <span class=\"popular\">Ganden Tsewang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dga&rsquo; ldan tshe dbang</span>, <span class=\"popular\">Trashi Gang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bkra shis sgang</span> monastery belonged to the <span class=\"popular emph\">Drugpa Kagy&uuml;</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">&rsquo;brug pa bka&rsquo; brgyud</span> subsect.<a href=\"#n64\" name=\"nb64\" class=\"note\">64</a> </p> <hr class=\"footnote-divider\"/> <h2>Notes</h2> <div class=\"footnote\"> <a name=\"n62\"/> <a href=\"#nb62\" class=\"note\"> [62] </a> The main territorial god (<span class=\"popular\">y&uuml;llha</span><span class=\"scholar\">Yul lha</span>) of <span class=\"popular\">Trashi Gang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bkra shis sgang</span> is lha rgod, whose residence is a rocky mountain on the opposite side of the <span class=\"popular\">Senge Tsangpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sengge gtsang po</span> valley. </div> <div class=\"footnote\"> <a name=\"n63\"/> <a href=\"#nb63\" class=\"note\"> [63] </a> Vitali, Roberto. <em>Records of Tho.ling: A Literary and Visual Reconstruction of the &ldquo;Mother&rdquo; Monastery in Gu.ge</em>.
