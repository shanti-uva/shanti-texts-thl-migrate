Its simple options (microphone, quality, save location) are available from the small triangle in the window when you choose \"new screen recording\".\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe two main full-featured commercial options are Screenflow (from Telestream) and Camtasia for Mac (from Tech Smith). Both have powerful editing features, but also have frustrating gaps compared to Windows-based programs. Adobe is working on releasing Captivate for the Mac, but as of now it is only in beta. Both offer sophisticated features to capture and to produce professional screencast video within a single application.\u003c/p\u003e","source_url":null,"is_primary":true,"created_at":"2013-09-15 04:18:57 UTC","updated_at":"2013-09-15 04:18:57 UTC","authors":[{"id":"2","fullname":"David Germano"}]}]}
