Name of the monastery</h4> <p>The full name of the monastery is dBal khyung gYung drung mthong smon gling. It is also known as dBal khyung gShen bstan mdo sngags gling.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-8-6-2\">2. Location</h4> <p>The monastery is located in rNga yab, southwest of Ri snang, the seat of Nyag rong county. There is a 28 km motorable road between the county town and Shang lang shod township, and another 15 km of road between the township and philosophical college (bshad grwa) of sKal bzang Monastery. dBal khyung Monastery is around an hour&rsquo;s walk from the college.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-8-6-3\">3. History</h4> <p>In the 8th Rab byung (1447-1506), there were eight men considered as saints in Nyag rong area, four of whom were Bonpo: Brag dben bKra shis rgyal mtshan, dBal khyung sMon lam rgyal mtshan, rTsis &rsquo;das Nyi ma rgyal mtshan and Dar ri sByin pa rgyal mtshan. </p> <p>According to gYung drung don grub (dBal khyung dgon pa&rsquo;i lo rgyus, MS, p.4) it was dBal khyung sMon lam rgyal mtshan who founded the monastery at rDzong mgo in the 8th Rab byung (1447-1506). His son, Blo gros rgyal mtshan, succeeded him as head of the monastery, but the monastery was destroyed by fire in the second half of Nam mkha&rsquo; grags pa&rsquo;s life, (another famous head of the monastery). It was rebuilt during the life-time of Tshul khrims bstan rgyal. The monastery is believed to have been moved during bSod nams dbang rgyal&rsquo;s time and was renamed dBal khyuung gYung drung mthong smon gling. </p> <p>Here is a list of the subsequent masters of the dBal khyung lineage: dBon po A kru, lHun grub tshul khrims, bstan &rsquo;dzin rgya mtsho, Bla ma tshul khrims, O rgyan rnam grol, Bla ma blo bzang, Karma ye shes, bsTan pa rgyal mtshan and gSang sngags gling pa (1864-?). The latter played an important role in the development of the monastery and Bon in the region. He enlarged the monastery, adding two assembly halls (&rsquo;du khang) and thirteen monks&rsquo; cells (grwa shag). &rsquo;Chi med rig &rsquo;dzin and mKha&rsquo; spyod dbang mo are also believed to have greatly contributed to the monastery&rsquo;s development. and gYung drung don grub is the the present head of the monastery who is assisted by sMon rgyal lha sras. The latter is a tantric practitioner. He was a son of Kun grol Hum chen, the sixth Kun grol grags pa and brother of mKha&rsquo; spyod dbang mo, a famous mkha&rsquo; &rsquo;gro and discoverer of gter ma texts in the 20th century. The monastery is famous for its unique and beautiful manuscript set of the Bonpo Kanjur which miraculously survived the turbulences of recent history. It was reproduced and published by A yung and Shug sdong sKal bzang phun tshogs in Chengdu 1985-1987 and again later by sMon rgyal lha sras, in Lhasa in collaboration with the Tibet Academy of Social Sciences. The monastery itself was totally destroyed, but was rebuilt by gYung drung don grub in the nineteen-eighties. </p> <h4 id=\"b6-8-6-4\">4.
