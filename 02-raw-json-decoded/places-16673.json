As the monument is found in a dip in the plain, the views to the east and west are somewhat circumscribed. On the other hand, the views north and south are quite open. The sandy terrain gently declines owards the east. Unhewn pieces of reddish brown sandstone were used to build the monument. </p> <h4 id=\"b2-1-31-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>In this region (<span class=\"popular\">Naktsang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Nag tshang</span>), sites such as <span class=\"popular\">Zhalung Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Zha lung rdo ring</span> are closely associated with the ancient <span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span>.</p> <h4 id=\"b2-1-31-4\">Site elements</h4> <h5 id=\"b2-1-31-4-1\">Enclosure</h5> <p>The enclosure is aligned in the cardinal directions, and measures 5 m (north-south) x 11.5 m (east-west). The west wall of the enclosure is largely intact, the east partly intact, and small parts of the north and south walls have survived as well. The variable-length (15 cm to 70 cm long) blocks and slabs of the double-course walls (50 cm to 60 cm thick) are level with the ground or elevated a maximum of 15 cm above it. The many stones scattered around the enclosure were probably once part of its construction (the surrounding terrain is largely free from such stones). </p> <h5 id=\"b2-1-31-4-2\">Pillar</h5> <p>The single tabular pillar (75 cm [height] x 1.1 m [basal girth]) is fairly well centered between the north and south walls of the enclosure. This pillar is situated 1.4 m from the inner edge of the west wall. The top of the pillar was broken off long ago, as evidenced by the heavy erosion of the fractured surface. </p> <h5 id=\"b2-1-31-4-3\">Tomb</h5> <p>In the vicinity of the pillar monument, a male resident of zha lung excavated a &lsquo;<span class=\"popular emph\">m&ouml;n dur</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mon dur</span>&rsquo; and used a femur he recovered from the tomb to make a thigh-bone trumpet (<span class=\"popular emph\">kangling</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rkang gling</span>). </p> <table cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\" class=\"navarrows\"> <tbody> <tr> <td class=\"leftcell\"> <a class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-left.gif\" title=\"Previous Section\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"midcell\"> <a class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-up.gif\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"rightcell\"> <a class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-right.gif\" title=\"Next Section\"/> </a> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div id=\"chap-id\">/bellezza2/b2-1-31/</div> <div style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\" class=\"jqmWindow\" id=\"chapRefWindow\"> <div class=\"closebtn\"> <a href=\"#\">Close</a> </div> <div style=\"height: 280px;\" class=\"conx-content\"> <h3>Note Citation for Page <span class=\"pgnm\"/> </h3> <p class=\"biblref\">John Vincent Bellezza, Antiquities of Zhang Zhung: A Comprehensive Inventory of Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Monuments on he Tibetan Upland (Charlottesville, VA 22904:Tibetan &amp; Himalayan Library, 2010), <span class=\"pgnm\"/>. </p> <h3>Bibliographic Citation</h3> <p>John Vincent Bellezza.
