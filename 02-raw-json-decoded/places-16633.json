There were no less than 20 Phase I residential loci, ranging in size from one room to clusters of multi-roomed buildings. The extent of these Phase I ruins gives the impression that as many as several hundred people may have once resided on \u003cspan class=\"popular\"\u003eSemodo\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"scholar\"\u003eSe mo do\u003c/span\u003e. This hriving island center consisted of well-built habitations, each of which was constructed around a cave or cleft in the base of the escarpment. These natural rock shelters appear to have constituted the inner sancta of the Phase I residential loci.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe remains of what appear to have been large, robustly built buildings indicate that Phase I se mo do was a powerful outpost of Upper Tibetan civilization. This cultural nucleus could only have been established with economic infusions from the mainland (currently, the island grasses could potentially support a herd of around 40 sheep and goats). A sequestered island bastion required adequate food reserves, implements, clothing, etc. that could only come from onshore. It is likely that only the social elite of the region could command and centralize such resources. This is corroborated by the size and quality of the Phase I archaic architectural remains; nowhere else in the gnam mtsho basin is there evidence for such a developed archaic residential hub. It seems likely, herefore, that insular se mo do was once the political and social nexus of the region. This is where the socially privileged chose to live, physically removed from the grazing lands, pastoral economy and manual labor on which heir well-being was based. Being surrounded by the deep and turbulent waters of gnam mtsho on all sides (landfall is a minimum of 4 km away), se mo do was well insulated from unwanted intrusions and invasion. The island is usually accessed in the winter months when gnam mtsho is frozen. Wintertime passage to se mo do is relatively secure and can facilitate the movement of large amounts of supplies.\u003ca href=\"#n106\" name=\"nb106\" class=\"note\"\u003e106\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/p\u003e \u003ch4 id=\"b1-2-59-3\"\u003eOral tradition\u003c/h4\u003e \u003cp\u003eAccording to cultural luminaries of the region, \u003cspan class=\"popular\"\u003eSemodo\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"scholar\"\u003eSe mo do\u003c/span\u003e was the most exclusive of Buddhist meditation centers at \u003cspan class=\"popular\"\u003eNamtso\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"scholar\"\u003eGnam mtsho\u003c/span\u003e.

This is graphically illustrated in he red ochre inscriptions found in various caves. Mostly composed of mantras, these writings attempt to symbolically establish Buddhist control over the island.

The Bon inscriptions were made from around 1000 CE (possibly even in the early historic period) to perhaps as late as circa 1250 CE, when the last Bonpo along the shores of \u003cspan class=\"popular\"\u003eNamtso\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"scholar\"\u003eGnam mtsho\u003c/span\u003e were converted to Buddhism.\u003ca href=\"#n108\" name=\"nb108\" class=\"note\"\u003e108\u003c/a\u003e Some Bon inscriptions and motifs were deliberately erased.

If left only to natural decay, more extensive portions of these stout structures should have endured. An architectural recreation occurred at se mo do, reflecting major cultural, political and economic changes buffeting Upper Tibet. As no ground plans are fully extant, it is not clear what the original configurations of the massive wall traces were. It could not be determined if they supported permanent roofs or if some merely enclosed open courtyards and patios. It appears that stones from ruined walls were restacked, adding to the difficulty of ascertaining the architectural identity of Phase I structures. It is certainly possible, given the thickness and quality of the footings, that these once underpinned all-stone corbelled edifices. Locally available scrub juniper may also have been employed in the construction of roofs. In either case, individual rooms would have been small in size. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003ePhase I structures include fa\u0026ccedil;ades built around the mouth of caves and overhangs, and elevated masonry footings extending 5 m to 14 m out from the base of the escarpment. These footings supported one to three vertical tiers of structures. The forward or lakeside edge of the foundations is commonly raised 1 m or more above ground level. Freestanding wall fragments (seldom more than 1 m in height) are limited to outer walls and partition walls subdividing each structure into two to four parts. The well-built random-rubble walls are 60 cm to 90 cm in thickness. Variable-length (up to 1 m) uncut pieces of naturally occurring blue limestone were used in construction. There is very little evidence for the use of adhesive materials. The robustly-built walls of the archaic constructions contrast with the much more lightly and crudely built fa\u0026ccedil;ades of the Lamaist retreats. These constitute the Phase II architecture of the island. Often, ma Ni mantras are carved in the formation surrounding the Phase II loci. No attempt was made by the Lamaists to redevelop the Phase I structures save for he restacking of stones. The Lamaist fa\u0026ccedil;ades are in a far better physical state than their archaic counterparts, an important indication of relative age. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThere are also a number of rectangular ceremonial structures around the island erected on the lakeshore benches hat parallel the escarpments. These appear to be archaic cultural structures, which in some cases, consisted of at least two graduated tiers. No attempt seems to have been made to rebuild them, but they are likely to have undergone a Buddhist reconsecration process. Their numbers underscore the ritual importance of se mo do. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eProbably, from no later than 1000 CE, the Lamaists (be they Buddhists or Bonpo) established a mere shadow of the earlier architectural presence on se mo do. The sum otal of their building ventures are a few small shrines and the fa\u0026ccedil;ades around their meditation caves (Phase II monuments). The older ruins provided windbreaks and the walls of the retreat caves kept out the fierce elements, providing the Lamaist inmates with some of the most secure housing anywhere at gnam mtsho. I envision two historical scenarios in which the Phase I infrastructure of se mo do was either destroyed or fell into disuse: 1) during the annexation of gnam mtsho by the spu rgyal emperors in circa seventh century CE punitive raids, 2) during internecine religious conflicts between 800 and 1000 CE. While these scenarios are highly speculative the end result was the same, the dismemberment of the archaic ritual and political nerve center of se mo do. As for he establishment of the archaic insular center, a prehistoric timeframe is suggested by the geomantic perfection of the site, the intensity of occupation and the inherent defensibility of the island (almost always a decisive factor at archaic cultural sites in Upper Tibet). \u003c/p\u003e \u003ch6 class=\"essay\"\u003eEasternmost cave\u003c/h6\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe first cave on the south side of \u003cspan class=\"popular\"\u003eSemodo\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"scholar\"\u003eSe mo do\u003c/span\u003e (beginning from the east side of the escarpment) is long and narrow (6 m x 2 m).

It consists of a narrow cave (7.8 m deep) in the formation, which is enclosed by a massively-built wall (4 m long, up to 1.5 m thick, around 1.3 m high).

A small fragment of its fa\u0026ccedil;ade has survived. Extending 4.7 m from the mouth of this cave and elevated about 1 m above the rocky bench that parallels the escarpment there is an area of fragmentary footings. Spanning 5 m along the foot of the escarpment, these Phase I ruins appear to be the remains of outlying rooms. Fourteen meters farther west, other footings belonging to the archaic cultural horizon stretch along the base of the escarpment for 12 m (49.89\u0026#900; / 23.43\u0026#900;).

The forward wall is elevated about 1 m above the bench. These walls appear to be the remains of two Phase I habitations (east and west). On the west end of this complex there is a mud-mortared fa\u0026ccedil;ade, enclosing an area (2.8 m x 3 m) underneath an overhang. On a ledge on the east side of the complex here is a small, lightly built structure (interior dimensions: 1.5 m x 1.3 m maximum, wall thickness: around 30 cm). There is a small opening in the forward wall of this structure and an entrance on its east side (70 cm x 50 cm) with a stone lintel in place. This 2-m-tall ceremonial structure is open at the top but the overhanging cliff face covers nearly all of it.
