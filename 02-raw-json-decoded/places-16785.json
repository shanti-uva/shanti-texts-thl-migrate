From the site, the views north (in the direction of the sacred mountain <span class=\"popular\">Shel Gangcham</span><span class=\"scholar\">Shel gangs lcam</span>) and south are wide open, while the views east and west are closed in by the ridges bounding the valley. The terrain is sandy and well drained. <span class=\"popular\">Ronggo M&ouml;ndur</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rong mgo mon dur</span> consists of at least 14 small funerary enclosures spread out over one-half km. These are quadrate structures, many of which appear to be aligned in the cardinal directions. Most of these poorly preserved structures appear to have double-course perimeter walls (50 cm to 60 cm hick). These walls are built of variable-length (up to 50 cm long) pieces of light-colored limestone. These stones are both laid flat and embedded in the ground edgewise. </p> <h4 id=\"b2-2-33-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>According to local sources, <span class=\"popular\">Ronggo M&ouml;ndur</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rong mgo mon dur</span> is an ancient <span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span> burial ground. </p> <h4 id=\"b2-2-33-4\">Site elements</h4> <ol> <li>Funerary structure FS1 (6 m x 3.5 m) consists of walls (indeterminate type) with stones that project as much as 35 cm above the ground surface. (31&deg; 52.577&#900; N. lat. / 85&deg; 05.019&#900; E. long.). In addition to limestone, the walls of FS1 also contain pieces of a dark gray metamorphic stone.</li> <li>Funerary structure FS2 (4 m x 2 m) is a highly fragmentary specimen (52.610&#900; / 04.968&#900;).</li> <li>Funerary structure FS3 (2.5 m x 2 m) is a highly fragmentary specimen (52.596&#900; / 04.973&#900;). </li> <li>Funerary structure FS4: (3.1 m x 3 m) is slightly elevated above the surrounding plain and is covered in loose rocks</li> <li> (52.582&#900; 04.962&#900;). </li> <li>Funerary structure FS5 (4.8 m x 2.5 m) exhibits small fragments of what appear to be single-course perimeter walls (52.560&#900; / 04.937&#900;). Stones in these walls project a maximum of 20 cm above ground level.</li> <li>Funerary structure FS6 (4 m across) has been reduced to one small coherent wall fragment along the perimeter (52.559&#900; / 04.923&#900;). FS6 is located near the link road through the area.</li> <li>Funerary structure FS7 (2 m across) is a highly fragmentary specimen (52.537&#900; / 04.923&#900;). </li> <li>Funerary structure FS8: (2.6 m x 3 m) is a highly fragmentary specimen (52.523&#900; / 04.927&#900;). </li> <li>Funerary structure FS9 (3 m x 3.3 m) is covered in stones (52.517&#900; / 04.905&#900;). </li> <li>Funerary structure FS10 (3.5 m x 2.4 m) is a better preserved enclosure with double-course perimeter walls (52.479&#900; / 04.923&#900;). Stones in these walls project a maximum of 20 cm above ground level.</li> <li>Funerary structure FS11 (3.5 m x 2.5 m) has significant segments of its double-course walls intact (52.461&#900; / 04.942&#900;). The stones in these walls are flush with the ground surface or slightly project above it.</li> <li>Funerary structure FS12 (4.7 m x 5 m) has remnants of all four walls intact. (52.450&#900; / 04.981&#900;). These walls appear to be of the single-course variety, but this may be because of a loss of stones. The stones of the walls project a maximum of 15 cm above ground level. FS12 is found at the edge of the motorable track.</li> <li>Funerary structure FS13 (2.4 m x 3.5 m) is covered in stones (52.435&#900; / 04.978&#900;). A tiny mound has formed on he west side of the structure. </li> <li>Funerary structure FS14 (3 m x 2.6 m) has a small double-course wall fragment in place, which exhibits both flat and upright stones (52.423&#900; / 05.008&#900;). </li> </ol> <table cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\" class=\"navarrows\"> <tbody> <tr> <td class=\"leftcell\"> <a class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-left.gif\" title=\"Previous Section\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"midcell\"> <a class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-up.gif\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"rightcell\"> <a class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-right.gif\" title=\"Next Section\"/> </a> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div id=\"chap-id\">/bellezza2/b2-2-33/</div> <div style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\" class=\"jqmWindow\" id=\"chapRefWindow\"> <div class=\"closebtn\"> <a href=\"#\">Close</a> </div> <div style=\"height: 280px;\" class=\"conx-content\"> <h3>Note Citation for Page <span class=\"pgnm\"/> </h3> <p class=\"biblref\">John Vincent Bellezza, Antiquities of Zhang Zhung: A Comprehensive Inventory of Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Monuments on he Tibetan Upland (Charlottesville, VA 22904:Tibetan &amp; Himalayan Library, 2010), <span class=\"pgnm\"/>. </p> <h3>Bibliographic Citation</h3> <p>John Vincent Bellezza.
