In this case, since the reply will of course contain a &ldquo;you,&rdquo; the rule requires that the first person be represented by a neutral, not egophoric, auxiliary.</p> <ul> <li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ང་སྨྱོན་པ་རེད་པས།</span> &ldquo;Am I mad?&rdquo;</li> <li><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">ཁྱེད་རང་སྨྱོན་པ་(མ་)རེད།</span> &ldquo;You are (not) mad!&rdquo;</li> </ul> <p class=\"Paragraph\">A more literal English rendering of this exchange would be:</p> <ul> <li>&ldquo;Are I mad?&rdquo;</li> <li>&ldquo;You are(n&rsquo;t) mad.&rdquo;</li> </ul> <p>This &ldquo;anticipatory mood&rdquo; is a distinctive feature of Tibetan. It appears not only in Standard Tibetan but in all other Tibetan dialects too, though not in the classical literary language.</p>","created_at":"2013-09-15 04:15:42 UTC","updated_at":"2013-09-15 04:15:42 UTC","id":1351,"title":null,"is_primary":true}]}
