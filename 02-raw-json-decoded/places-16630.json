The cave towers some 550 m above this plain and occupies a highly isolated and defensible location. This capacious cave has two entrances separated by a distance of 46 m: northwest mouth (26 m wide) and south mouth (16 m wide). </p> <h4 id=\"b1-2-56-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>According to residents of <span class=\"popular\">G&ouml;tsang M&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rgod tshang smad</span>, <span class=\"popular\">Gyamchung Pukpa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gyam chung phug pa</span> was an ancient stronghold from which battles were fought. </p> <h4 id=\"b1-2-56-4\">Site elements</h4> <p>A steep slope leads up to the northwest mouth of <span class=\"popular\">Gyamchung Pukpa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gyam chung phug pa</span>, which was once barricaded by a massive wall. A 17 m length of this random-rubble dry-mortar wall is still partly intact. This 2-m-thick structure was constructed from uncut, variable length (up to 80 cm long) limestone blocks. Its maximum standing height is 1.8 m on the exterior and 2.5 m on the interior. This structure is likely to have had defensive value. The south mouth (overlooks the plain) was also hemmed in by a huge wall, which has been reduced to a pile of rubble reaching 3 m in height. Below the south mouth there are unassailable cliffs. The floor of the cave is uneven and covered in limestone outcrops and rubble. The ceiling is 5 m to 8 m in height and even higher in some places. There is a distance of more than 60 m from the northwest mouth to the innermost recesses of the cave. The eastern portion of the cave descends at least 15 m to a little standing water. Although now fouled, this spring is likely to have once supplied water for the inhabitants of <span class=\"popular\">Gyamchung Pukpa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gyam chung phug pa</span>. Just above the standing water there is a huge pile of ash, which now resembles fine, dark soil. There are bone fragments among his ash, a sign of significant human occupation. The ash midden follows the line of the slope, covering an area of around 100 m&sup2;.</p> <table cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\" class=\"navarrows\"> <tbody> <tr> <td class=\"leftcell\"> <a class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-left.gif\" title=\"Previous Section\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"midcell\"> <a class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-up.gif\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"rightcell\"> <a class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-right.gif\" title=\"Next Section\"/> </a> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div id=\"chap-id\">/bellezza/b1-2-56/</div> <div style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\" class=\"jqmWindow\" id=\"chapRefWindow\"> <div class=\"closebtn\"> <a href=\"#\">Close</a> </div> <div style=\"height: 280px;\" class=\"conx-content\"> <h3>Note Citation for Page <span class=\"pgnm\"/> </h3> <p class=\"biblref\">John Vincent Bellezza, Antiquities of Zhang Zhung: A Comprehensive Inventory of Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Monuments on he Tibetan Upland (Charlottesville, VA 22904:Tibetan &amp; Himalayan Library, 2010), <span class=\"pgnm\"/>. </p> <h3>Bibliographic Citation</h3> <p>John Vincent Bellezza.
