The site appears to have had a functional relationship with the defunct agricultural lands located below in the <span class=\"popular\">Chulung Gongma</span><span class=\"scholar\">Chu lung gong ma</span> valley. There is also a ruined settlement of seven ancient <span class=\"popular emph\">do khang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rdo khang</span> spread out across sandy slopes and benches approximately 300 m to the north (B-45). We might surmise that the political and/or religious elite of this agricultural enclave inhabited the <span class=\"popular\">Dongmar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gdong dmar</span> fortress. The hard to reach stronghold is built in reddish crags that rise 90 m above he valley floor. This siting must have provided the facility with a secure military position. Flanked by sheer rock faces, potential attackers would have faced a formidable challenge from the defenders. The dry-mortar, random-rubble block-work contains stones that are generally 20 cm to 60 cm in length. </p> <h4 id=\"b1-1-59-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>According to local sources, <span class=\"popular\">Dongmar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gdong dmar</span> was an ancient settlement.</p> <h4 id=\"b1-1-59-4\">Site elements</h4> <h5 id=\"b1-1-59-4-1\">Upper structure</h5> <p>The upper complex measures just 6 m x 2 m to 4 m. Nearly all traces of the superstructures have disappeared, but revetments up to 4 m in height still cling to the crags. The remains of a 1-m to 1.2-m wide stone-lined walkway extend down from the upper complex for a distance of 7 m. The lower sections of this original access-way have been destroyed. </p> <h5 id=\"b1-1-59-4-2\">Middle structure</h5> <p>The middle complex is situated on the prow of a spur 15 m below the upper complex. It consists of a single building (6.5 m x 3.3 m) that was constructed against a rock face. Its forward wall is 60 cm thick and 2.7 m in height, 1 m of which is freestanding. The largest stones in the revetment are 80 cm in length. Only fractional footings of the rear wall have survived. These are found on the edge of a rock face.</p> <h5 id=\"b1-1-59-4-3\">Lower structure</h5> <p>The lower complex is also a single building, which is situated about 5 m below the middle complex. This structure was also built against a rock face and measures 9.4 m x 2.5 m. The maximum elevation of the forward wall is 3 m, with 2 m of that standing independently.</p> <table cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\" class=\"navarrows\"> <tbody> <tr> <td class=\"leftcell\"> <a class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-left.gif\" title=\"Previous Section\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"midcell\"> <a class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-up.gif\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"rightcell\"> <a class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-right.gif\" title=\"Next Section\"/> </a> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div id=\"chap-id\">/bellezza/b1-1-59/</div> <div style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\" class=\"jqmWindow\" id=\"chapRefWindow\"> <div class=\"closebtn\"> <a href=\"#\">Close</a> </div> <div style=\"height: 280px;\" class=\"conx-content\"> <h3>Note Citation for Page <span class=\"pgnm\"/> </h3> <p class=\"biblref\">John Vincent Bellezza, Antiquities of Zhang Zhung: A Comprehensive Inventory of Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Monuments on he Tibetan Upland (Charlottesville, VA 22904:Tibetan &amp; Himalayan Library, 2010), <span class=\"pgnm\"/>. </p> <h3>Bibliographic Citation</h3> <p>John Vincent Bellezza.
