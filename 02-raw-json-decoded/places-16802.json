The undulating plateau is sandy and covered in turf and <span class=\"popular emph\">drama</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">gra ma</span> scrub. High mountains on three sides (including the Great Central Himalaya) constrain the view in these directions. The southern vista, in the direction of <span class=\"popular\">puling</span><span class=\"scholar\">Spu gling</span>, is somewhat more open. gna&rsquo; ser thang consists of two large rectangular enclosures with predominantly heaped-stone wall perimeters. These walls are made of variable-length (10 cm to 40 cm long) uncut pieces of gray limestone and tan crystalline sandstone. This ostensible funerary site is one of the few mortuary sites surveyed in the badlands of <span class=\"popular\">Gug&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ge</span>. Many <span class=\"popular\">Gug&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ge</span> funerary sites are likely to have been covered by sedimentary deposits that dominate the geology of this region. Other burials may be concealed in inaccessible caves. In any case, gna&rsquo; ser thang is the only example of heaped-stone wall enclosures found in <span class=\"popular\">Gug&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ge</span> to date. In addition to the structures themselves, the lofty aspect and physical conditions of the site resemble hose of the <span class=\"popular\">Jangtang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Byang thang</span>. These affinities are likely to betoken cultural links between these two geographic regions and physiographic provinces. </p> <h4 id=\"b2-2-50-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>None was collected.</p> <h4 id=\"b2-2-50-4\">Site elements</h4> <h5 id=\"b2-2-50-4-1\">West enclosure</h5> <p>The west enclosure is generally aligned in the cardinal directions, and measures 13 m (north-south) x 29 m (east-west). Its walls are around 2 m in thickness and are generally elevated 40 cm to 70 cm above the surrounding terrain. These walls are mostly composed of sparsely distributed heaps of stones. There are also a few hints of coherent wall fragments. The west enclosure has been seriously damaged by the extraction of stones. This extraction is probably related to the recent construction of the link road that traverses <span class=\"popular\">Naser Tang</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gna&rsquo; gser thang</span>. The enclosure is comprised of one large open space. Inside the enclosure there are four depressions up to 1 m deep. These depressions appear to be he remains of excavations. These excavations must have taken place long ago because they are dotted with <span class=\"popular emph\">drama</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">gra ma</span>, a slow growing woody shrub.</p> <h5 id=\"b2-2-50-4-2\">East enclosure</h5> <p>The east enclosure is situated only 3 m east of the west enclosure. It is of the same design and construction as the west enclosure. The main portion of the east enclosure is also aligned in the cardinal directions, and measures 8 m (north-south) x 15 m (east-west). Connected to the south side of this structure there is a less well preserved analogous enclosure (9 m x 10 m) of unclear form. There are three <span class=\"popular emph\">drama</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">gra ma</span>-studded depressions in this portion of the enclosure; the probable signs of excavations carried out long ago. </p> <table cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\" class=\"navarrows\"> <tbody> <tr> <td class=\"leftcell\"> <a class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-left.gif\" title=\"Previous Section\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"midcell\"> <a class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-up.gif\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"rightcell\"> <a class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-right.gif\" title=\"Next Section\"/> </a> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div id=\"chap-id\">/bellezza2/b2-2-50/</div> <div style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\" class=\"jqmWindow\" id=\"chapRefWindow\"> <div class=\"closebtn\"> <a href=\"#\">Close</a> </div> <div style=\"height: 280px;\" class=\"conx-content\"> <h3>Note Citation for Page <span class=\"pgnm\"/> </h3> <p class=\"biblref\">John Vincent Bellezza, Antiquities of Zhang Zhung: A Comprehensive Inventory of Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Monuments on he Tibetan Upland (Charlottesville, VA 22904:Tibetan &amp; Himalayan Library, 2010), <span class=\"pgnm\"/>. </p> <h3>Bibliographic Citation</h3> <p>John Vincent Bellezza.
