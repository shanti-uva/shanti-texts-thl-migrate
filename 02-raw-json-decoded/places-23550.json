Name of the monastery</h4> <p>Rab rgyal </p> <h4 id=\"b6-5-10-2\">2. Location</h4> <p>The monastery is located on the bank of Yangtze which is the borderline between TAR and Sichuan Province.</p> <p>It takes two days on horseback to reach there from the county town of Derge.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-5-10-3\">3. History</h4> <p>The founder of the monastery was bsTan pa lhun grub from Ri rtse drug in Khyung po, but the exact date of its foundation remains unknown.

Rituals</h4> <p>There are two important annual rituals: the summer offerings (dbyar mchod) for fifteen days and the winter offerings (dgun mchod) for seven days.

Occupation of the local people </h4> <p>Farmers and nomads</p> <p>I was told that there was no one in the monastery when I was just about to go to Rab rgyal and Thar bde Monasteries from Derge in autumn in 1997. I therefore could not visit them. This is why I have so little information concerning these monasteries.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-5-10-9\">Source</h4> <h5 id=\"b6-5-10-9-1\">(2) Texts</h5> <ol type=\"1\"> <li>KGLG, Vol.1, pp. 629-630</li> </ol> <table xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\" cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\" class=\"navarrows\"><tbody><tr><td class=\"leftcell\"><a class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"><img src=\"/global/images/arrow-left.gif\" title=\"Previous Section\"/></a></td><td class=\"midcell\"><a class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"><img src=\"/global/images/arrow-up.gif\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"/></a></td><td class=\"rightcell\"><a class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"><img src=\"/global/images/arrow-right.gif\" title=\"Next Section\"/></a></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div id=\"chap-id\">/bonpo-monasteries/b6-5-10/</div><div style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\" class=\"jqmWindow\" id=\"chapRefWindow\"><div class=\"closebtn\"><a href=\"#\">Close</a></div><div style=\"height: 280px;\" class=\"conx-content\"><h3>Note Citation for Page <span class=\"pgnm\"/></h3><p class=\"biblref\">Dondrup Lhagyal, Phuntso Tsering Sharyul, Tsering Thar, Charles Ramble, and Marietta Kind, A Survey of Bonpo Monasteries and Temples in Tibet and the Himalaya (ISBN: , :, 2010-07-06), <span class=\"pgnm\"/>. </p><h3>Bibliographic Citation</h3><p>Dondrup Lhagyal, Phuntso Tsering Sharyul, Tsering Thar, Charles Ramble, and Marietta Kind.
