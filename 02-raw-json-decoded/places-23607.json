Location</h4> <p>The monastery is located 21 km north of Songpan, the seat of Zung chu county.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-16-3-3\">3. History</h4> <p>There are two sNang zhig monasteries in Amdo: one in rNga khog and the other in Shar khog, the latter belongs to the lineage of the former, since it was founded by a descendant of Do &rsquo;phags chen po (b.1168). He is regarded as the first master of the sNang zhig lineage.</p> <p>Do &rsquo;phags chen po and sKyang za g-yu sgron had three sons: Nyi ma &rsquo;dzin, &rsquo;Dul ba rgyal mtshan, and gYung drung rgyal mtshan (alias Shes rab &rsquo;od zer). The eldest son was sent to Zhu sgom &rsquo;phrul zhig for religious training and later became known as Bya chen Nyi ma &rsquo;dzin. &rsquo;Dul ba rgyal mtshan, and gYung drung rgyal mtshan migrated to Shar khog. The family of &rsquo;Dul ba rgyal mtshan became known as lCags mdud and the monastery he founded was called sNang zhig lCags mdud and later became known as sNa steng bKra shis g-yung drung gling (No.199). However, it was gYung drung rgyal mtshan, the youngest brother, who took away the famous silver image (dngul sku) of Dran pa nam mkha&rsquo; of the family in rNga khog with him when he came to Shar khog where he later founded a monastery called sNang zhig dngul sku dgon. He had a son called bsTan pa rgyal mtshan who succeeded him and looked after the monastery. However, at a later date, the sacred silver image fell into the possession of the lCags mdud family.</p> <p>Their lineages of the three brothers became known as the &ldquo;three lineages of sNang zhig&rdquo; (sNang zhig khag gsum). </p> <p>The following is a list of the masters in the lineage of the sNang zhig dngul sku:</p> <ol type=\"1\"> <li>bsTan pa rgyal mtshan</li> <li>bsTan &rsquo;dzin ye shes rgyal mtshan </li> <li>gYung drung tshe ring </li> <li>Yon tan rgyal mtshan </li> <li>Nyi ma bstan &rsquo;dzin</li> <li>Tshe dbang rgyal po</li> <li>Zla ba rgyal mtshan </li> <li>Klu &rsquo;bum yag </li> <li>Bya &rsquo;phur</li> <li>Rin chen lhun grub </li> <li>bsTan pa tshul khrims </li> <li>Nyi ma rgyal mtshan </li> <li>&rsquo;Dul ba rgyal mtshan </li> <li>Tshul khrims rgyal mtshan </li> <li>Shes rab blo gros </li> <li>Zla ba rgyal mtshan </li> <li>Rin chen lhun grub </li> <li>Nam mkha&rsquo; lhun grub </li> <li>Rin chen rgyal mtshan </li> <li>Kun dga&rsquo; phun tshogs </li> <li>gYung drung bstan &rsquo;dzin</li> <li>Blo gros thogs med </li> <li>Nyi ma rgyal mtshan </li> <li>Tshul khrims rgyal mtshan </li> <li>gTsug phud rnam rgyal </li> </ol> <p>After the last master&rsquo;s death, Nam mkha&rsquo; blo gros of sNang zhig in rNga khog became the master of the monastery, he was succeeded successively by Tshul khrims bsTan pa&rsquo;i rgyal mtshan, Shes rab bstan &rsquo;dzin, and A tog rtogs ldan. The monastery was knocked down during the Cultural Revolution. It was rebuilt in the 1980s. Shes rab &rsquo;od zer (b.1971), the present head of the monastery was recognized as the reincarnation of Tshul khrims bstan pa&rsquo;i rgyal mtshan, a famous hermit who, however, did not belong to the sNang zhig lineage.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-16-3-4\">4.
