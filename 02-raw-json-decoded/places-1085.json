Name</h4> <p>The full name of the monastery is &rsquo;Dra gYung drung bsam &rsquo;grub gling.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-9-1-2\">2. Location</h4> <p>The monastery is located in a valley of Phyag ru river, 55 km south of rTa&rsquo;u, the county seat.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-9-1-3\">3. History</h4> <p>bSam &rsquo;grub combines three monasteries: Brag ra, &rsquo;Ong gong and sMong skyid.<a href=\"#n32\" name=\"nb32\" class=\"note\">32</a> </p> <p>1) Brag ra Monastery was founded by Khod po Blo gros thogs med,<a href=\"#n33\" name=\"nb33\" class=\"note\">33</a> in the Iron-Ox year of the 5th Rab byung (1301). Blo gros thogs med built a small temple and another for practitioners (sgrub khang) in Brag ra when he sanctified Mount sBa zhabs brag dkar, and named them Khod po Monastery. The place was successively named sNgags sde byang chub gling by Khyung rgod, bDud &rsquo;dul yang rtse gling by Nyi ma dbang ldan, and gNas sgo pad ma gling by gSang sngags gling pa (1864-?) when each of these masters visited the monastery. Following is a list of the successive masters of the monastery:</p> <ol type=\"1\"> <li>Blo gros rgyal mtshan </li> <li>rNam dag gtsug phud</li> <li>sGrub gshen sNang ldan</li> <li>Nyi ma dbang ldan (who rebuilt a larger assembly hall (&rsquo;du khang) with twelve columns)</li> <li>rMe nag rTogs ldan </li> <li>rTul &rsquo;dre rTogs ldan </li> <li>Go tog rTogs ldan </li> <li>dBra ston Rin chen</li> <li>Khyung gter &rsquo;Od zer gling pa </li> <li>Khod spungs dBang ldan (for twenty years) </li> <li>gYung drung dpal bzang (for eighteen years) </li> <li>Thugs rje gling pa (for a few years) </li> <li>gYung drung bstan &rsquo;dzin (for three years)</li> <li>bsTan pa rgyal mtshan (for a few years until the Cultural Revolution) </li> </ol> <p>The monastery originally comprised of an assembly hall, a kitchen (ja khang), a mchod rten, and a residence for the monks (grwa khang). It had two establishments, one for the ritual cycle of dBal gsas (dbal gsas sgrub grwa) and another for the atonement ritual of the goddess Srid pa rgyal mo (srid rgyal sgrub grwa). It had a giant thangka and a large collection of books including a complete manuscript copy of the Bonpo Kanjur made by Khod po Blo gros thogs med. The monks were required to take their ordination vows at sMan ri Monastery (No.1).</p> <p>2) &rsquo;Ong gong Monastery was founded by Khod po Blo gros thogs med at lCang log sna.<a href=\"#n34\" name=\"nb34\" class=\"note\">34</a> It started out as a hermitage and gradually expanded into a monastery, but fell into decline owing to an ongoing dispute with Nya mtsho. As a result it was moved to sMug rong dgu rdza brag dkar, but fell into decline again soon after its reconstruction, as two thirds of the monks were converted to Buddhism.</p> <p>The remaining monks followed Nyi ma rgyal mtshan, who at that time had returned to &rsquo;Dra valley from sMan ri. The site where they settled was called dGe gsar in the local dialect, which probably means dgon gsar, &ldquo;new monastery&rdquo;; the ruins of a stupa are still visible. A master of the monastery called A khu Ye shes, rebuilt a &rsquo;du khang with four columns and the monastery became known as &rsquo;Ong gong. Following is a list of the successive abbots of the monastery until the Cultural Revolution:</p> <ol type=\"1\"> <li>dBal &rsquo;gugs sKal bzang rgyal mtshan </li> <li>rTogs ldanTshul khrims rnam dag </li> <li>dBal &rsquo;dzin bsTan &rsquo;dzin dbang rgyal </li> <li>rTogs ldan Sangs rgyas </li> <li>rDzong lu Ye shes </li> <li>A &rsquo;be Tshul khrims </li> <li>Ra tsho lcags thar </li> </ol> <p>There were about eighty novices and monks at the monastery in the mid-20th century. They were required to go to sMan ri Monastery for three years training and ordination vows.</p> <p>3) According to oral tradition, sMong skyid Monastery was founded in the 6th Rab byung (1327-1386) by the three brothers of Khro tshang who travelled from gShen Dar sding Monastery to &rsquo;Dra valley in Khams. It was called Glang &rsquo;ong. The eldest brother was called gYung drung rgyal mtshan. After a few generations, the monastery was moved to sMong skyid and became known as sMong skyid dgon rnying, the &ldquo;old sMong skyid Monastery&rdquo;. Later when it was moved again it was known as both sMong skyid dgon gsar, the &ldquo;New sMong skyid Monastery&rdquo;, and Phun tshogs gling. There were forty novices and monks at the monastery. </p> <p>In the 1980s, the masters of the three monasteries, sPrul sku Zla ba grags pa, mKhan po bsTan &rsquo;dzin nyi ma, mKhan po gYung drung dbang rgyal, mKhan zur &rsquo;Chi med, mKhan po Lo thar, Wa lo mGon po and &rsquo;Gyur med agreed to rebuild the three monasteries together as one monastery.

Income and expenses</h4> <p>The main expenses of the monastery are the three major rituals: Ma rgyud sgrub mchod, the summer fast (dbyar gnas) and the dgu gtor rite. The three spyi ba are responsible for organizing the rituals: for the Ma rgyud sgrub mchod, the three spyi ba collect 10 kg of barley from each monk in the monastery; for the dbyar gnas, each family offers as much barley as it can, and the dgu gtor rite is organized and sponsored by the monastery itself. </p> <h4 id=\"b6-9-1-11\">12.

Local festivals</h4> <p>The mountain behind the monastery is called sKu bla Ri mchog and is the residence of a local deity of the same name. There is a la btsas on its summit. Khod po Blo gros thogs med unveiled the mountain as a sacred mountain (gnas ri), and as the celestial abode of the tutelary deity Ma rgyud in the 13th century. The revelation was confirmed by gSang sngags gling pa (1864-?) in the 19th century. The mountain&rsquo;s circumambulation takes place on the 1st day of the 1st month and the 13th day of the 5th month. The mountain facing the monastery is called Seng ge rgyab bsnol and its three peaks are believed to represent the three local deities Seng ge rgyab bsnol, &rsquo;Brong nus and Brag li. There is a la btsas on each peak which are renewed by both religious and lay communities on the same day as the festival of the mountain behind the monastery. Seng ge rgyab bsnol and Brag li were sanctified by Thugs rje gling pa, a master from Nyag rong in the early 20th century, and &rsquo;Brong nus by gSang sngags gling pa. There is another sacred mountain called sPos ri ngad ldan which is located northeast of the monastery, and which was sanctified by gSang sngags gling pa. There is also la btsas on its summit.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-9-1-13\">14.

Name</h4> <p>The monastery&rsquo;s full name is &rsquo;Dra Chu mig gYung drung bstan rgyas gling. Because the first site of the monastery was located near a spring, the monastery was called Chu mig monastery.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-9-2-2\">2. Location</h4> <p>The monastery is located 81 km southwest and a further three hours&rsquo; walk from rTa&rsquo;u, the county seat.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-9-2-3\">3. History</h4> <p>According to legend, during Gri gum btsan po&rsquo;s time, because of the persecution of Bon in Central Tibet, Me nyag lCe tsha mkhar bu, a famous Bonpo master, escaped to Khams and established a hermitage in &rsquo;Dra valley which became the first Bonpo establishment in the area. Later, during Khri srong lde btsan&rsquo;s persecution of Bon, sNya chen Bla ma, a Bonpo master and a descendant of sNya chen Li shu stag ring, another great Bonpo master, also escaped to Khams and took refuge in &rsquo;Dra where he rebuilt the hermitage which later became the first Bonpo monastic establishment in the area. According to the same legend, he brought a cypress branch from Mount Kongpo Bon ri and planted it in &rsquo;Dra valley where it grew into a tree which exists to this day. There is a village called sNya gad<a href=\"#n37\" name=\"nb37\" class=\"note\">37</a> in the valley which is said to have preserved numerous ancient texts inherited from their ancestors, but unfortunately they were all destroyed during the Cultural Revolution. Shortly after, Byang Nyi ma rgyal mtshan, a descendant of Khro tshang in rDza khog brought to the monastery a statue representing gShen rab Mi bo as a three-year old boy from Central Tibet. He also enlarged the monastery. His residence (of which only the ruins remain today) was called Pho nyi bla brang. Later, a master called gTsug phud moved the monastery to its present site<a href=\"#n38\" name=\"nb38\" class=\"note\">38</a> and renamed it Chu mig. According to the same legend, he was a descendant of the sPa tshang family based in Yu ring village, Central Tibet. </p> <p>Later, Khod po Blo gros thogs med (1280-1337) arrived in &rsquo;Dra valley and unveiled the sacred mountain (gnas ri) of &rsquo;Dra gnas the&rsquo;u bo. Among his foremost disciples there were the Seven Great Lamas. One of the seven was a master from sNya gad village situated near Chu mig Monastery.</p> <p>dGe bshes gYung drung bstan &rsquo;dzin, the founder of Brag ra Monastery, took Chu mig Monastery under his wing, and thus the two monasteries developed close ties during his lifetime. Hor ra bDud &rsquo;dul also came to &rsquo;Dra valley and founded Seng ge Monastery. This was the first Buddhist monastery in the area. From the time of Khyung gter &rsquo;Od zer gling pa onwards, most masters of his lineage looked after the monastery. Shar rdza bKra shis rgyal mtshan, Bya btang Tshe dbang &rsquo;gyur med, dBra ston sKal bzang bstan pa&rsquo;i rgyal mtshan visited the monastery to give teachings. In the first half of 19th century, A bdud lHun &rsquo;grub rdo rje, A lung Blo gros rgyal mtshan, Khyung po Nyi ma rgyal mtshan, O rgyan Thug rje gling pa were the successive masters of the monastery. </p> <p>The monastery was razed during the Cultural Revolution and rebuilt in the 1980s under the leadership of Bla ma Nor bu. Khyung dbon Rig &rsquo;dzin Yon tan rnam rgyal gave teachings there in 1990 which marked the resumption of the monastery&rsquo;s religious activities. Khyung sras bsTan &rsquo;dzin nyi ma is the present mkhan po.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-9-2-4\">4.

Location </h4> <p>The monastery is 28 km south of rTa&rsquo;u, the county seat. </p> <h4 id=\"b6-9-3-3\">3. History</h4> <p>Oral tradition relates two legendary accounts of the monastery. According to one of the legends, after the decline of a Bonpo monastery founded by Khod po Blo gros thogs med (1280-1337) at lCang lo sna in rTa&rsquo;u, several of its elder monks went to the sacred mountain rBa zhabs brag dkar and founded a hermitage there which later developed into a monastery. According to the other legend, a Bonpo saint called Nam mkha&rsquo; snang mdog from rGyal rong founded gSang phug, a hermitage on the same sacred mountain that gradually expanded into a monastery known by the same name. </p> <p>The monastery was looked after by the descendants of Khod po Blo gros thogs med. Later &rsquo;Gro mgon Tshe dbang &rsquo;gyur med, &rsquo;Go mgon Shes rab dgongs rgyal, &rsquo;Gro mgon gYung drung tshul khrims, Nam mkha&rsquo; rgyal mtshan and Nam mkha&rsquo; bsam &rsquo;grub gave teachings at the monastery. It seemed to have enjoyed a long period of prosperity that ended when a group of local Buddhist chiefs who envious of the monastery&rsquo;s wealth hired a gang of thieves to ransack and burn down the monastery. </p> <p>Many years later, during the dGe lugs pa persecution when many Bonpo monasteries in the area were force to disband, rDza dGe sprul Yid bzhin legs &rsquo;grub, undaunted by the dGe lugs pa sectarian policy, went to Dartsedo to obtain permission to rebuild at least one Bonpo monastery. He combined nine Bonpo monasteries together into one and called it dGu rdza dgon, the &ldquo;Nine Monasteries in the Clay Mountain&rdquo;. After that, it was maintained by gYung drung rgyal mtshan and Byams pa &rsquo;phrin las for many years. It was wrecked during the Cultural Revolution and was rebuilt and resumed its religious activities in the 1980s. </p> <h4 id=\"b6-9-3-4\">4.

Local festivals</h4> <p>There is a la btsas on top of the mountain behind the monastery. No date is fixed for its renewal ceremony which is performed by Bonpos only.</p> <p>The mountain facing the monastery, sBa zhabs brag dkar, is the most important sacred mountain in the area. Khod po Blo gros thogs med sanctified it and discovered a number of important Bonpo gter ma texts there. The mountain is venerated every Monkey-Year by both Bonpo and Buddhists who circumambulate the mountain in the direction prescribed by their respective traditions. There is a short anonymous text about the mountain entitled sBa zhabs brag dkar dkar chag dad pa&rsquo;i glu dbyangs, which mentions another longer text entitled sBa zhabs brag dkar byin rlabs shugs &rsquo;byung. </p> <h4 id=\"b6-9-3-13\">14.

Name</h4> <p>The monastery is also known as sTon pa rang grub.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-9-4-2\">2. Location</h4> <p>The monastery is located 87 km south of the town Ba smad of rTa&rsquo;u county.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-9-4-3\">3. History</h4> <p>There are two legends about the origin of the monastery and its name. According to one legend recorded by &rsquo;Phrin dga&rsquo;<a href=\"#n39\" name=\"nb39\" class=\"note\">39</a> which I also heard when I visited the monastery in 1997, Dam pa rang grol, a Bonpo master from dGe bshes tsa in Rong brag (rGyal rong), came to Ba smad and established a hermitage there in the 3rd Rab byung (1147-1206). The hermitage gradually expanded into a monastery which was named after its founder. </p> <p>According to the other legend, a Bonpo master called Rig &rsquo;dzin Shar ba rnal &rsquo;byor attempted to make a statue of gShen rab Mi bo, but despite his efforts he did not succeed, so in the end he threw out the unfinished statue into the monastery&rsquo;s courtyard and returned to his room. The next morning, the statue had become a perfect representation of gShen rab Mi bo. It was named sTon pa Rang grub, the &ldquo;self-manifesting master&rdquo; and the monastery was named after it. The statue is believed to have survived until the mid-20th century.</p> <p>Although there is a list of masters which &rsquo;Phrin dga&rsquo; claims represents the lineage of the monastery&rsquo;s masters, it is obvious that there are several names in the list that have nothing to do with the monastery&rsquo;s history so I did not find it necessary to include it here.

Because of the king who was gravely ill, gYung drung bstan &rsquo;dzin was recalled to rGyal rong, but before leaving sMan ri he asked Shes rab dbang rgyal, the abbot of sMan ri Monastery at the time, if he could establish a new &rsquo;cham tradition in rGyal rong since he was not able to learn the entire grwa sa &rsquo;cham tradition of sMan ri. The abbot accepted, and thus, upon his return, he established the Nang so &rsquo;cham tradition which eventually spread to the Nyag rong, rTa&rsquo;u, Brag &rsquo;go and rGyal rong areas. In this monastery, both traditions of &rsquo;cham are performed.
