History\u003c/h4\u003e \u003cp\u003eAccording to legend, during Gri gum btsan po\u0026rsquo;s time, because of the persecution of Bon in Central Tibet, Me nyag lCe tsha mkhar bu, a famous Bonpo master, escaped to Khams and established a hermitage in \u0026rsquo;Dra valley which became the first Bonpo establishment in the area. Later, during Khri srong lde btsan\u0026rsquo;s persecution of Bon, sNya chen Bla ma, a Bonpo master and a descendant of sNya chen Li shu stag ring, another great Bonpo master, also escaped to Khams and took refuge in \u0026rsquo;Dra where he rebuilt the hermitage which later became the first Bonpo monastic establishment in the area. According to the same legend, he brought a cypress branch from Mount Kongpo Bon ri and planted it in \u0026rsquo;Dra valley where it grew into a tree which exists to this day. There is a village called sNya gad\u003ca href=\"#n37\" name=\"nb37\" class=\"note\"\u003e37\u003c/a\u003e in the valley which is said to have preserved numerous ancient texts inherited from their ancestors, but unfortunately they were all destroyed during the Cultural Revolution. Shortly after, Byang Nyi ma rgyal mtshan, a descendant of Khro tshang in rDza khog brought to the monastery a statue representing gShen rab Mi bo as a three-year old boy from Central Tibet. He also enlarged the monastery. His residence (of which only the ruins remain today) was called Pho nyi bla brang. Later, a master called gTsug phud moved the monastery to its present site\u003ca href=\"#n38\" name=\"nb38\" class=\"note\"\u003e38\u003c/a\u003e and renamed it Chu mig.

Hor ra bDud \u0026rsquo;dul also came to \u0026rsquo;Dra valley and founded Seng ge Monastery. This was the first Buddhist monastery in the area. From the time of Khyung gter \u0026rsquo;Od zer gling pa onwards, most masters of his lineage looked after the monastery.

According to one of the legends, after the decline of a Bonpo monastery founded by Khod po Blo gros thogs med (1280-1337) at lCang lo sna in rTa\u0026rsquo;u, several of its elder monks went to the sacred mountain rBa zhabs brag dkar and founded a hermitage there which later developed into a monastery. According to the other legend, a Bonpo saint called Nam mkha\u0026rsquo; snang mdog from rGyal rong founded gSang phug, a hermitage on the same sacred mountain that gradually expanded into a monastery known by the same name. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe monastery was looked after by the descendants of Khod po Blo gros thogs med.

It seemed to have enjoyed a long period of prosperity that ended when a group of local Buddhist chiefs who envious of the monastery\u0026rsquo;s wealth hired a gang of thieves to ransack and burn down the monastery. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMany years later, during the dGe lugs pa persecution when many Bonpo monasteries in the area were force to disband, rDza dGe sprul Yid bzhin legs \u0026rsquo;grub, undaunted by the dGe lugs pa sectarian policy, went to Dartsedo to obtain permission to rebuild at least one Bonpo monastery. He combined nine Bonpo monasteries together into one and called it dGu rdza dgon, the \u0026ldquo;Nine Monasteries in the Clay Mountain\u0026rdquo;. After that, it was maintained by gYung drung rgyal mtshan and Byams pa \u0026rsquo;phrin las for many years. It was wrecked during the Cultural Revolution and was rebuilt and resumed its religious activities in the 1980s. \u003c/p\u003e \u003ch4 id=\"b6-9-3-4\"\u003e4.

The hermitage gradually expanded into a monastery which was named after its founder. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAccording to the other legend, a Bonpo master called Rig \u0026rsquo;dzin Shar ba rnal \u0026rsquo;byor attempted to make a statue of gShen rab Mi bo, but despite his efforts he did not succeed, so in the end he threw out the unfinished statue into the monastery\u0026rsquo;s courtyard and returned to his room. The next morning, the statue had become a perfect representation of gShen rab Mi bo. It was named sTon pa Rang grub, the \u0026ldquo;self-manifesting master\u0026rdquo; and the monastery was named after it. The statue is believed to have survived until the mid-20th century.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAlthough there is a list of masters which \u0026rsquo;Phrin dga\u0026rsquo; claims represents the lineage of the monastery\u0026rsquo;s masters, it is obvious that there are several names in the list that have nothing to do with the monastery\u0026rsquo;s history so I did not find it necessary to include it here. The monastery was rebuilt and resumed its religious activities in the 1980s. The last three descendants of Khod po Blo gros thogs med who looked after the monastery are Blo gros, his nephew (khu dbon gdung brgyud), rDo rje, and the latter\u0026rsquo;s nephew, Nor bu dbang chen (b.1967), who is the present khri pa of the monastery.\u003c/p\u003e \u003ch4 id=\"b6-9-4-4\"\u003e4.

Because of the king who was gravely ill, gYung drung bstan \u0026rsquo;dzin was recalled to rGyal rong, but before leaving sMan ri he asked Shes rab dbang rgyal, the abbot of sMan ri Monastery at the time, if he could establish a new \u0026rsquo;cham tradition in rGyal rong since he was not able to learn the entire grwa sa \u0026rsquo;cham tradition of sMan ri. The abbot accepted, and thus, upon his return, he established the Nang so \u0026rsquo;cham tradition which eventually spread to the Nyag rong, rTa\u0026rsquo;u, Brag \u0026rsquo;go and rGyal rong areas. In this monastery, both traditions of \u0026rsquo;cham are performed.
