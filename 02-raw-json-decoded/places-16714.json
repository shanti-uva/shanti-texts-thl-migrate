The terrain is almost level, well drained and turf covered. This uniquely designed site is dominated by two parallel rows of upright stones, which extend for 67 m. It seems likely that <span class=\"popular\">Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo ring</span> represents a variant type of archaic funerary monument. It possesses structural features of both isolated pillars and slab wall sites. </p> <h4 id=\"b2-1-72-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>According to local <span class=\"popular emph\">drok pa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">&rsquo;brog pa</span>, <span class=\"popular\">Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo ring</span> was an ancient <span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span> site. </p> <h4 id=\"b2-1-72-4\">Site elements</h4> <p>The two rows of pillars are oriented northwest-southeast, and stand 4.2 m to 4.7 m from one another. Unfortunately, the integrity of the site was recently compromised when stones were extracted in order to line the edge of the neighboring road. Near the northwest end of the site many stones are now missing, making an analysis of the morphological characteristics of <span class=\"popular\">Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo ring</span> difficult. It is possible that there were more than two rows of upright stones at the northwest end of the site. The two extant rows consist of uncut light-colored granite and limestone slabs and blocks (20 cm to 90 cm long) embedded in the ground edgewise. These stones are flush with the ground surface or are elevated above it to a maximum height of 25 cm. The only exceptions are a few more prominently elevated stones in the middle portion of he east wall. These taller stones are dominated by a firmly planted pillar-like granite boulder (1 m [height] x 1.4 m [basal girth]). On the southeast end of <span class=\"popular\">Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo ring</span> there are traces of a single line of upright stones bisecting the two main rows of stones.</p> <table cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\" class=\"navarrows\"> <tbody> <tr> <td class=\"leftcell\"> <a class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-left.gif\" title=\"Previous Section\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"midcell\"> <a class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-up.gif\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"rightcell\"> <a class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-right.gif\" title=\"Next Section\"/> </a> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div id=\"chap-id\">/bellezza2/b2-1-72/</div> <div style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\" class=\"jqmWindow\" id=\"chapRefWindow\"> <div class=\"closebtn\"> <a href=\"#\">Close</a> </div> <div style=\"height: 280px;\" class=\"conx-content\"> <h3>Note Citation for Page <span class=\"pgnm\"/> </h3> <p class=\"biblref\">John Vincent Bellezza, Antiquities of Zhang Zhung: A Comprehensive Inventory of Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Monuments on he Tibetan Upland (Charlottesville, VA 22904:Tibetan &amp; Himalayan Library, 2010), <span class=\"pgnm\"/>. </p> <h3>Bibliographic Citation</h3> <p>John Vincent Bellezza.

It is situated on the left side of the valley on quite level sandy and gravelly bottomland. The site is not far from the ridge that encloses he west side of the valley. From it there are sweeping views to the east and quite open views to the north and east as well. <span class=\"popular\">Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo ring</span> (North) is found on the eastern edge of the walled pillars (II.1b) typology. This site, with its neighbor <span class=\"popular\">Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo ring</span> (South) (C-162), form the eastern border of the core region of Upper Tibet, as delineated by the distribution of its two sui generis pillar monuments. Like 40 percent of other sites of this typology, there is a visible outlying funerary enclosure at <span class=\"popular\">Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo ring</span> (North). </p> <h4 id=\"b2-1-86-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>According to local <span class=\"popular emph\">drok pa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">&rsquo;brog pa</span>, <span class=\"popular\">Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo ring</span> (North) was constructed by the ancient <span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span>.</p> <h4 id=\"b2-1-86-4\">Site elements</h4> <h5 id=\"b2-1-86-4-1\">Enclosure</h5> <p>The square enclosure (17 m x 17.5 m) is aligned in the cardinal directions. This structure slightly declines in an easterly direction. Although much of the enclosure is intact, integral double-course wall segments are in evidence along just a few sections of the perimeter. Most of these wall segments are made up of one vertical course of stones laid flat on the ground. There are also wall segments composed of several vertical courses of flat stones, as well as those of upright stones embedded in the ground that protrude a maximum of 20 cm above ground level. In other words, all three types of stonework (flat stones of one vertical course, flat stones of multiple vertical courses and stones laid edgewise), which regularly occur in enclosures of this typology, are represented at <span class=\"popular\">Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo ring</span> (North). The enclosure is constructed of gray and beige metamorphic rocks of variable length. </p> <p>In the middle section of the west wall (17 m long) there are slabs that run perpendicular (east-west) to the wall course to create a barred pattern. This type of wall has not been encountered in any other enclosure of the II.2b typology. The coherent double-course segments of the north wall (16 m long) are 90 cm thick. On the east end of the north wall there are two or three vertical courses of double-course stones laid flat, with a height of around 25 cm. The east wall (17.5 m long, 75 cm thick) has segments consisting of three or four vertical courses of flat stones with a maximum height of 40 cm. There are also double-course upright stones in the east wall. One of the erect slabs of the east wall projects 30 cm above ground level. There are also longer stones, set perpendicular to the east wall course, which demarcate one or possibly two openings. If indeed, there were wo portals or punctuations in the east wall, these were not symmetrically arrayed. The south wall is 17.5 m in length. Inside the enclosure there are three or four parallel lines of upright slabs. These meandering slab courses generally run east-west and extend for 2 m. The network of slab walls lies 5 m from the north wall and 9 m from the south wall of the enclosure. The slabs are between 15 cm and 45 cm in length, and project a maximum of 10 cm above the ground surface. Two more lines of the same type of upright slabs are situated inside the enclosure, 2 m farther west. A similar use of slab walls to mark the interior of an enclosure is found at <span class=\"popular\">Doring Chakra</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo ring lcags ra</span> (C-74).</p> <h5 id=\"b2-1-86-4-2\">Pillars</h5> <p>There is a single north-south line of 12 pillars, 13 m in length, which is situated near the inner edge of the west wall. Eight of these pillars are made of a grayish or beige metamorphic rock, and three are of a light-colored igneous rock (Long-stones DR8, DR9 and DR11). Some orange climax lichen grows on the pillars, especially on their north side. From south to north, the dimensions and characteristics of these pillars are as follows:</p> <ol> <li>Long-stone DR1: four-sided, heavily inclined (60 cm [height] x 80 cm [basal girth]).</li> <li>Long-stone DR2: tabular (60 cm x 1 m).</li> <li>Long-stone DR3: irregularly shaped (55 cm x 1 m).</li> <li>Long-stone DR4: irregularly shaped (45 cm x 80 cm).</li> <li>Long-stone DR5: irregularly shaped, broken (20 cm x 60 cm).</li> <li>Long-stone DR6: tabular, broken (30 cm x 90 cm). An upper section of this pillar (30 cm long) lies beside he in situ portion.</li> <li>Long-stone DR7: tabular, broken (25 cm x 80 cm).</li> <li>Long-stone DR8: irregularly shaped (70 cm x 70 cm). There is a significant gap between DR7 and DR8 in which there is a tiny in situ pillar. This broken specimen is made of a dark gray rock. </li> <li>Long-stone DR9: irregularly shaped (1.3 m x 1.1 m). </li> <li>Long-stone DR10: tabular (1.6 m x 1.4 m).</li> <li>Long-stone DR11: (60 cm x 90 cm).</li> </ol> <h5 id=\"b2-1-86-4-3\">Outlying funerary structure</h5> <p>There is a square funerary enclosure (2.5 m x 2.5 m) situated 25 m east of the walled pillars. It is found on broad and level sandy ground. This structure is made of the same kind of metamorphic rock used to fence the pillars. The funerary enclosure is in quite poor condition. It appears to have been aligned in the cardinal directions and to have had double-course perimeter walls. These walls are composed of upright slabs (10 cm to 50 cm long), which project 5 cm to 20 cm above the ground surface. Although stones are scattered around the enclosure, it does not appear to have any interior structural elements. </p> <table cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\" class=\"navarrows\"> <tbody> <tr> <td class=\"leftcell\"> <a class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-left.gif\" title=\"Previous Section\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"midcell\"> <a class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-up.gif\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"rightcell\"> <a class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-right.gif\" title=\"Next Section\"/> </a> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div id=\"chap-id\">/bellezza2/b2-1-86/</div> <div style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\" class=\"jqmWindow\" id=\"chapRefWindow\"> <div class=\"closebtn\"> <a href=\"#\">Close</a> </div> <div style=\"height: 280px;\" class=\"conx-content\"> <h3>Note Citation for Page <span class=\"pgnm\"/> </h3> <p class=\"biblref\">John Vincent Bellezza, Antiquities of Zhang Zhung: A Comprehensive Inventory of Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Monuments on he Tibetan Upland (Charlottesville, VA 22904:Tibetan &amp; Himalayan Library, 2010), <span class=\"pgnm\"/>. </p> <h3>Bibliographic Citation</h3> <p>John Vincent Bellezza.

The site has good views up and down the valley (to the north and south). The terrain gently descends o the east and is sandy and spotted with turf. <span class=\"popular\">Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo ring</span> (South) consists of a unique combination of walled pillars (II.1b) and an array of pillars (II.1c). Rather than a temple-tomb edifice, the walled pillars are appended to the west side of the concourse of pillars. This constitutes a unique ceremonial facility, the design and construction of which probably reflect localized cultural and/or political proclivities. The close physical integration of these two types of monuments underscores their allied temporal, functional and cognitive relationships. In conjunction with neighboring <span class=\"popular\">Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo ring</span> (North) (C-128), <span class=\"popular\">Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo ring</span> (South) represents the most easterly expression of the sui generis pillar monuments of the core region of Upper Tibet. The two <span class=\"popular\">Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo ring</span> sites circumscribe the eastern border of a distinctive paleocultural entity, which in a general sense can be equated with prehistoric and early historic <span class=\"popular\">Zhang Zhung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Zhang zhung</span>.<a href=\"#n50\" name=\"nb50\" class=\"note\">50</a> <span class=\"popular\">Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo ring</span> (South) was discovered in 1928 by Roerich&rsquo;s Central Asiatic Expedition.<a href=\"#n51\" name=\"nb51\" class=\"note\">51</a> </p> <h4 id=\"b2-1-87-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>In far western <span class=\"popular\">Namru</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gnam ru</span>, sites such as <span class=\"popular\">Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo ring</span> (South) are generally ascribed to the ancient <span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span>. </p> <h4 id=\"b2-1-87-4\">Site elements</h4> <h5 id=\"b2-1-87-4-1\">Walled pillars</h5> <p>The rectangular enclosure is aligned in the cardinal directions, and measures 10 m (east-west) x 7 m (north-south). The perimeter walls are flush with the ground surface and in a poor state of preservation. The exception is the south wall, which includes a coherent double-course segment (90 cm thick). The walls of the enclosure were built primarily using light-colored stones of variable length. These stones appear to have been laid flat on the ground. The interior of the enclosure is free of structural elements.</p> <p>There are two standing pillars fixed in the ground near the inner edge of the disintegrated west wall of the enclosure. These two pillars are spaced 2 m apart. The south pillar is an irregularly shaped dark metamorphic rock (65 cm [height] x 70 cm [basal girth]). The north pillar is a four-sided light-colored igneous rock (1 m x 90 cm). The north pillar has been singled out for butter offerings (<span class=\"popular emph\">March&ouml;</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mar mchod</span>). Circular depressions have been carved into the top portion of this pillar and filled with butter. There is also a single line of prayer flags tied to the base of the north pillar. These offerings are probably related to the propitiation of personal, household and territorial deities. There are a few stones scattered around the base of the two pillars; these are likely to be the vestiges of the sacrificial structure, which Roerich reports existed here in 1928.<a href=\"#n52\" name=\"nb52\" class=\"note\">52</a> There is also a collapsed pillar (1.3 m long) now lying in the middle of the enclosure among a small pile of stones. A photograph taken of the site in 1928 shows that there were four sizable in situ pillars erected more or less in a row at that time.<a href=\"#n53\" name=\"nb53\" class=\"note\">53</a> One of these pillars appears to be the dislodged specimen. The whereabouts of the fourth pillar (it appears to have been a tabular specimen in the northernmost placement) is unknown. Geomorphologic changes and vandalism probably account for the degradation of the monument. </p> <h5 id=\"b2-1-87-4-2\">Array of pillars</h5> <p>The array of pillars begins 1.5 m east of the enclosure with the stelae. There do not appear to have been any intervening structures between these paired monuments. The array of pillars is aligned in the cardinal directions, and measures 26.5 m (east-west) x 7 m (north-south). The 14-m long eastern half of this concourse is extremely degraded, and contains less than 40 tiny in situ pillars. Although virtually all structural evidence has been effaced, it seems likely that the array of pillars was originally wider than 7 m, given its length and he usual rectilinear proportions of this monument typology. Water flowing over the locale from one or more flood events (as evidenced by alluvial depositions) has had a detrimental impact on the site. </p> <p>In the west half of the array there are roughly 100 intact and broken pillars still left standing. Some of hese pillars have orange climax lichen growing on them. The tallest specimen (60 cm) is found near the northwest corner of the array. Other unbroken specimens are 15 cm to 30 cm in height. Most of the <span class=\"popular emph\">Doring</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rdo ring</span> are tabular and made of a light-colored metamorphic rock. Near the southwest corner of the array there is an uprooted pillar 1 m in length. An analysis of the pattern of spacing between pillars, suggests that originally there may have been around 1000 standing stones in he concourse. There are now roughly 13 east-west rows of pillars with slabs placed edgewise in the ground in he same rows. These slabs are 10 cm to 30 cm in length and are generally flush with the ground surface. Perhaps here were alternating superficial slabs and standing stones in each row (it is now difficult to distinguish pillars that may have been broken off at the base from slabs that were installed at ground level). <span class=\"popular\">Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo ring</span> (South) is the only site with this particular slab and pillar configuration surveyed to date. This distinctive design feature, like the absence of an appended edifice, may be related to the site&rsquo;s position at the extreme eastern edge of the territorial distribution of he monument typology. The lack of an appended temple-tomb raises questions as to where local burials were conducted. Scattered around the array of pillars are small pieces red quartzitc sandstone (?) and milky quartz. These stones must have been used as decorative elements at the site. </p> <hr class=\"footnote-divider\"/> <h2>Notes</h2> <div class=\"footnote\"> <a name=\"n50\"/> <a href=\"#nb50\" class=\"note\"> [50] </a> The geographic and cultural parameters associated with <span class=\"popular\">Zhang Zhung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Zhang zhung</span> are discussed at length in Bellezza, <em>Zhang Zhung</em>. </div> <div class=\"footnote\"> <a name=\"n51\"/> <a href=\"#nb51\" class=\"note\"> [51] </a> For a photograph of the site, see Roerich, <em>Trails o Inmost Asia</em>, 416 ff. In an entry dated March 22, George Roerich wrote (Roerich, <em>Trails to Inmost Asia</em>, 415, 416): After a sixteen-mile march we camped in a narrow valley sheltered by undulating, grassy hills. The place was called Do-ring or &ldquo;The Long Stone&rdquo; because of curious megalithic monuments found in its vicinity. These monuments were the first of that kind discovered in Tibet&hellip;The megalithic monuments of Do-ring, situated some thirty miles south of the great salt lake of Pang-gong tsho-cha, date back to the pre-Buddhistic period of Tibetan history. They consist of important alinements of eighteen rows of erect stone slabs. Each of these alignments were drawn from east to west, having at its western extremity a cromlech or stone circle consisting of several menhirs arranged more or less in a circle. The menhirs are vertically placed with a crude stone table or altar in front of them. It was evidently a sanctuary of some primitive cult. But what was its age and use?If one compares the famous megalithic monuments of Carnac in Brittany, to the discovered megaliths of Tibet, he is at once struck by the remarkable similarity of the two sets of monuments. The Carnac alinements are situated from east to west and have at their western extremity a cromlech or circle of stones. The Do-ring monuments have precisely the same arrangement. The sacerdotal use of the Carnac monuments remains unknown to he present day, although numerous explanatory theories are advanced. It seems to me that we possess a clue to he explanation of the megalithic structures of northern Tibet. The megalithic monuments of Do-ring have a large figure in the shape of an arrow laid out with stone slabs, and situated at the eastern extremity of the alinement with its point towards the alinement. The arrow is an important symbol in the ancient nature cult of Tibet, and is connected to the cult of the sun and heavenly fire in the form of lightning, which it symbolizes&hellip; The presence of the arrow figure at the eastern extremity of the Do-ring monuments indicates that he whole structure was dedicated to some nature cult and very possibly to that of the sun, of which the arrow is a symbol. This is an important conclusion, since up to now no megalithic monuments could be satisfactorily explained.Although Roerich&rsquo;s description of <span class=\"popular\">Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo ring</span> (South) is generally sound, there are several mischaracterizations that have crept into it. These, at least in part, can be attributed to the difficulties of coming across an ancient monument for the very first time in tough environmental conditions. Another problem is that Roerich was intent on comparing <span class=\"popular\">Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo ring</span> (South) with Carnac, a continent away, a monument which, in fact, has only limited morphological similarity to the one in Tibet. In the eastern half of the highly degraded pillar and slab array, Roerich visualized an arrow structure made of stone slabs, for which there is no empirical evidence (no stone arrow has been found at any of the arrays of pillars surveyed to date). This detracts from Roerich&rsquo;s assertion that the symbolism of he arrow should be taken as the prime instrument for interpreting the function of the site. This does not necessarily mean, however, that the arrow and its symbolism did not figure into the ceremonial exercises carried out at the site, for as Roerich rightly notes, the arrow is an ancient Tibetan ritual object. The reported existence of a cromlech or ring of stones on the west end of the site also does not bear well with the empirical evidence. In fact, the walls referred to form a quadrate enclosure. The crude stone table or altar Roerich describes no longer exists. This structure was probably a ritual cairn (<span class=\"popular emph\">lats&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">la bstas</span> or <span class=\"popular emph\">lhato</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">lha tho</span>) of later origins, which was used by local <span class=\"popular emph\">drok pa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">&rsquo;brog pa</span> to propitiate personal, household and/or territorial deities. Many such structures were destroyed in the Chinese Cultural Revolution. Finally, it should be noted that <span class=\"popular\">Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo ring</span> (South) is located 20 miles (as the crow flies), not 30 miles, south of the alkaline lake and flats known as <span class=\"popular\">Drangkhok Tso</span><span class=\"scholar\">Brang khog mtsho</span> and 20 miles southwest of the giant salt lake <span class=\"popular\">Serling Tso</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ser gling mtsho</span> (either one of which is Roerich&rsquo;s Pang-gong tsho-cha). In John Vincent Bellezza, &ldquo;Doring Revisited.&rdquo; <em>Himal</em> 8, no. 3 (1995), 29-32, I describe my 1994 exploration of a site known as <span class=\"popular\">Ch&ouml;rten Gyawa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mchod rten brgya ba</span> located a few kilometers northwest of <span class=\"popular\">B&uuml;lkar Tso</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bul dkar mtsho</span> (White Soda Lake), in old <span class=\"popular\">Namru</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gnam ru</span> district. This site features ten rows of cairns with ten cairns in each row, which are said to have been erected by <span class=\"popular\">Guru Rinpoch&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ru rin po che</span> in order to stem floodwaters arising from <span class=\"popular\">B&uuml;lkar Tso</span><span class=\"scholar\">Bul dkar mtsho</span>. I provisionally identified this site as Roerich&rsquo;s Do-ring, believing that it had been architecturally modified in order to bring it within the remit of Tibetan Buddhism. It is now clear, however, that Do-ring is no other than <span class=\"popular\">Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo ring</span> (South). It must be noted that similar rows of cairns are found at the eponymous funerary site of <span class=\"popular\">Ch&ouml;rten Gyawa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mchod rten brgya ba</span> (D-6) in <span class=\"popular\">Shentsa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Shan rtsa</span>.

The site is situated on a well-drained gravelly prominence elevated about 10 m above the east side of the canyon floor. The canyon floor boasts a perennial stream and tall grass, which is cut for fodder. The site is dominated by a single pillar that was erected on moderately sloping ground. </p> <h4 id=\"b2-1-103-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>According to residents of <span class=\"popular\">Dongpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gdong spo</span>, <span class=\"popular\">Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo ring</span> magically arose on its own in ancient times. It is considered a good fortune stone (<span class=\"popular emph\">yangdo</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">g.yang rdo</span>).</p> <h4 id=\"b2-1-103-4\">Site elements</h4> <p>The highly weathered main pillar is made of a gray rock (1.3 m [height] x 80 cm [basal girth]). It has four sides hat are generally aligned in the intermediate points. The tip of the pillar has been partially broken. A few stones are scattered around its base. The base of a second, much smaller pillar (15 cm x 18 cm) is situated 1.45 m o the north. Reportedly, this pillar was broken by a youth in the early 1960s. A tabular stone (50 cm basal girth) that projects 20 cm above ground level is situated 75 cm north of the broken pillar. There are also two slabs fixed in the ground 90 cm north of the tabular stone. These slabs are 20 cm and 40 cm in length and protrude about 10 cm above ground level. The three projecting stones were deliberately planted in the ground. Given the scant structural evidence, however, it is not clear what type of structure these and other stones on the site may have constituted. </p> <h4 id=\"b2-1-103-5\">Affiliated sites</h4> <h5 id=\"b2-1-103-5-1\">dNgos g.yu</h5> <p> <span class=\"popular\">Ng&ouml;yu</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dngos g.yu</span>, a site with substantial arable land, lies downstream of <span class=\"popular\">Doring</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdo ring</span> in the same drainage system (31&deg; 07.080&#900; N. lat. / 80&deg; 11.399&#900; E. long. / 4210 m). No farming has taken place here in living memory. An attempt was made in the Chinese Cultural Revolution to restore water to <span class=\"popular\">Ng&ouml;yu</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dngos g.yu</span> but this project proved a failure. The loss of water resources for irrigation can largely be attributed to the long-term desiccation of the <span class=\"popular\">Gug&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gu ge</span> region. Recently, two houses were built by herders amid the old agricultural holdings. In close proximity to these houses there is a rammed-earth residential carcass (13 m x 7 m) that has been converted into a livestock pen. Downstream of the benches on which the defunct farm fields lie here is a bifurcation in the canyon. On the tip of the spur dividing the two branch canyons there is a ruined <span class=\"popular emph\">Ch&ouml;rten</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mchod rten</span> and above it, a rammed-earth structure (7 m x 13 m x 2.5 m). Above the rammed-earth structure there is a stone building foundation (15 m x 5 m). These residential structures straddling the spur are said to be the castle ruins of a local chieftain, who had the itle of <span class=\"popular emph\">ng&ouml;yu chup&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">dngos g.yu bcu dpon</span>. (sp.?). These ruins can be confidently ascribed to Buddhist architectural styles that became common after 1000 CE. </p> <p>About 1 km upstream of the <span class=\"popular emph\">ng&ouml;yu chup&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">dngos g.yu bcu dpon</span> site, at the next bifurcation in the canyon, there are several ruined <span class=\"popular emph\">Ch&ouml;rten</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mchod rten</span> and an adobe-block carcass, the remains of a Buddhist chapel (<span class=\"popular emph\">lhakang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">lha khang</span>) in all probability (4260 m). Nearby, there are two clusters containing a total of around 15 caves that were hewn from the earthen formation. These cave complexes may have constituted the original locus of settlement in <span class=\"popular\">Ng&ouml;yu</span><span class=\"scholar\">Dngos g.yu</span>.</p> <h5 id=\"b2-1-103-5-2\">Shel did</h5> <p>The remains of a large dispersion are found in the bottom of the <span class=\"popular\">Dongpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gdong spo</span> valley, above the west bank of the <span class=\"popular\">Dongpo Tsangpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gdong spo gtsang po</span> (31&deg; 07.4&#900; N. lat. / 80&deg; 07.2&#900; E. long. / 4130 m). This site known as <span class=\"popular\">Shedi</span><span class=\"scholar\">Shel did</span> (sp.?) consists of contiguous piles of stone rubble and depressions in the ground. No authoritative oral tradition about <span class=\"popular\">Shedi</span><span class=\"scholar\">Shel did</span> could be collected. It is said that some of the pits on the site are the remains of old gold mines. <span class=\"popular\">Shedi</span><span class=\"scholar\">Shel did</span> may possibly represent the traces of an early settlement in the <span class=\"popular\">Dongpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gdong spo</span> valley, a valley without cave complexes to speak of. The site was constructed from red, blue and gray cobbles. <span class=\"popular\">Shedi</span><span class=\"scholar\">Shel did</span> can be divided into two sectors: northwest (170 m x 200 m) and southeast (90 m x 100 m). </p> <p>The northwest sector dispersion of <span class=\"popular\">Shedi</span><span class=\"scholar\">Shel did</span> is devoid of stone wall fragments. There is, however, a rammed-earth carcass (5 m x 13 m x 3.5 m) in the northwest sector. It is built on a prominence that overlooks the <span class=\"popular\">Dongpo Tsangpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gdong spo gtsang po</span>. The long straight walls and truncated west end of this structure are in conformance with Buddhist temple construction, particularly that of the 11th to 15th century CE. The existence of this ruin confirms the testament of one elderly resident, claiming that a Buddhist facility once existed at <span class=\"popular\">Shedi</span><span class=\"scholar\">Shel did</span>. This high elevation edifice appears to belong to a latter phase of construction than the superficial stone dispersions surrounding it. The main link road in <span class=\"popular\">Dongpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gdong spo</span> cuts right hrough the northwest sector, and stones taken from it were used to line the roadbed. The southeast sector contains disintegrated revetments, a clear indication that superstructures of some kind once stood here. The revetment fragments reach a maximum height of 1.5 m. A corral and <span class=\"popular emph\">Ch&ouml;rten</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mchod rten</span> were recently built in the southeast sector. </p> <table cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\" class=\"navarrows\"> <tbody> <tr> <td class=\"leftcell\"> <a class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-left.gif\" title=\"Previous Section\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"midcell\"> <a class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-up.gif\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"rightcell\"> <a class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-right.gif\" title=\"Next Section\"/> </a> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div id=\"chap-id\">/bellezza2/b2-1-103/</div> <div style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\" class=\"jqmWindow\" id=\"chapRefWindow\"> <div class=\"closebtn\"> <a href=\"#\">Close</a> </div> <div style=\"height: 280px;\" class=\"conx-content\"> <h3>Note Citation for Page <span class=\"pgnm\"/> </h3> <p class=\"biblref\">John Vincent Bellezza, Antiquities of Zhang Zhung: A Comprehensive Inventory of Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Monuments on he Tibetan Upland (Charlottesville, VA 22904:Tibetan &amp; Himalayan Library, 2010), <span class=\"pgnm\"/>. </p> <h3>Bibliographic Citation</h3> <p>John Vincent Bellezza.
