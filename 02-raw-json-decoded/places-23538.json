Name</h4> <p>The monastery&rsquo;s full name is Dung dkar smin grol gling and derives from its location at the foot of Mount Dung dkar lha gnyan dkar po which is believed to be the abode of the deity A myes Dung dkar.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-4-6-2\">2. Location</h4> <p>The monastery is located 20 km north of Chab cha town in Ur rti Township in Gong he county, mTsho lho prefecture in Qinghai province.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-4-6-3\">3. History</h4> <p>In the early 20th century there were two Bonpo hermits of unknown origin, living in two caves on Mount Dung dkar lha gnyan dkar po. There were also four monks from Tsha kho, rGyal rong living in the same place as those of the hermits. gYung drung rgyal mtshan and gYung drung, two of the four monks were known as the dGe slong rnam gnyis. These monks from Tsha kho and and another two monks Tshul khrims bstan &rsquo;dzin (from Che rje sTong skor) and dPal mchog from Khyung mo Monastery (No.123) decided to set up a monastery together. Tshul khrims bstan &rsquo;dzin, who had stayed at sTeng chen Monastery (No.139) asked his master bZod pa rgya mtsho which of the three following sites: Hi la wor in sTong che (in Khri ka), Mo we (in Che rje) or Dung dkar (in Chab cha), would be the best location for a new monastery. The master immediately and without hesitating selected Dung dkar. The monks then requested bSod nams g-yung drung dbang rgyal, a famous Bonpo master from Ba yan to assist and guide them in their task. As a result, bSod nams g-yung drung dbang rgyal and the four monks are regarded as the founders of Dung dkar Monastery. I had the opportunity to visit dPal mchog, one of the four monks, in the late nineteen-seventies shortly before his death. According to bsTan &rsquo;dzin (b. n 1930), the head of the monastery whom I interviewed, the monastery was founded around 1940. A new small assembly hall was rebuilt in 1982. The present hall was built in 1992 by Tulku Tshul khrims of Ba yan,.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-4-6-4\">4.
