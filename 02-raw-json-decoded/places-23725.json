In the thirteenth century the Mongolian Yuan Dynasty established garrisons in Batang and later the Dalai Lama’s Ganden Palace (<em><span class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\">dga’ ldan pho brang</span></em>) government established large monasteries in the region.

The two chiefs from Lhasa died of illness in Batang and were replaced by indigenous leaders, who converted the office of governor into a hereditary post. In 1728 the reigning governors were made headmen (土司 <em><span class=\"chinese\" title=\"Type ID here\">tusi</span></em>) within the Qing imperial system.
