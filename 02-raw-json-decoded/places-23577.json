Histroy</h4> <p>Bla ma A lco from Khyung po came to Brag steng where he lived in a cave as a hermit and gave teachings. Later he was made the chief of Brag steng area. From that time onwards, the eldest son in the Khyung po family inherited the position of king, while the younger son that of master of the monastery. According to dKa&rsquo; thub, the monastery was founded in the Fire-Ox year of the 5th Rab byung (1277). The cave, where the original hermitage was established, was known as Khyung lung rnam rgyal lha rtse and later when it was expanded into a monastery, as gShen bstan rnam rgyal lha rtse gling. </p> <p>The monastery survived until the Cultural Revolution. dKa&rsquo; thub provides a list of the monastery&rsquo;s succession of its masters, but since the author himself doubts its authenticity, I have not reproduced it here.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-11-5-4\">4.
