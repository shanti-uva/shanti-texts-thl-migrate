Name</h4> <p>The monastery&rsquo;s full name is gTo lung Yang dben dpal dgon. It is also called gTo sgang gYung drung gling.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-8-10-2\">2. Location </h4> <p>The monastery is located in a valley called gTo khog, 20 km southwest of Brag &rsquo;go, the county seat in dKar mdzes Prefecture.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-8-10-3\">3. History</h4> <p>Because rGyal rong gYung drung ye shes, the founder of the monastery, came from rGyal rong, the monastery was called rGyal rong Monastery. There are no reliable written Sources concerning the site&rsquo;s history before that time. According to legend, following King Khri srong lde btsan&rsquo;s persecution of Bon in the 8th century A.D., many Bonpo masters in Central Tibet fled to Amdo and Khams. One among them, rMe&rsquo;u bSod nams g-yung drung, established a hermitage in Tre hor<a href=\"#n29\" name=\"nb29\" class=\"note\">29</a>, Khams. Because the hermitage attracted ten thousand disciples, he extended the hermitage into a monastery which then became known as Khri tsho, meaning &ldquo;Ten Thousand&rdquo;. After its destruction by fire, rTsa ra sTobs ldan &rsquo;od zer rgyal mtshan founded another monastery called Shug sgang (&ldquo;Hill of Cypress Trees&rdquo;, after the cypress forest on the mountain on which it was located). It had an assembly hall (&rsquo;du khang) with eight rooms and more than twenty monks&rsquo; cells below the assembly hall. It was again destroyed by fire.</p> <p>Following is a list of the successive masters:</p> <ol type=\"1\"> <li>rMe&rsquo;u bSod nams g-yung drung </li> <li>rTsa ra sTobs ldan &rsquo;od zer rgyal mtshan </li> <li>bKra shis bsam &rsquo;grub </li> <li>gYung drung rgyal mtshan </li> <li>gYund drung phun tshogs </li> <li>Pad bsod </li> <li>bsTan &rsquo;dzin dbang ldan </li> <li>dGu na Tshe bstan </li> <li>Lo god </li> <li>Lung phug</li> <li>sKal bzang skyabs </li> <li>Chos bstan </li> <li>Blo ldan </li> <li>gYung drung rgyal mtshan </li> <li>rGyal rong gYung drung ye shes </li> <li>gYung drung rgyal mtshan alias gYung drung bstan &rsquo;dzin</li> <li>gSang sngags grags pa </li> <li>Grags pa </li> <li>Nyi ma rgyal mtshan </li> <li>gYung drung rgyal mtshan </li> <li>Tshe dbang bstan &rsquo;dzin </li> <li>bKra shis don &rsquo;grub</li> <li>Zla ba grags pa</li> </ol> <p>rGyal rong gYung drung ye shes, the 15th master, was a son of the king &rsquo;Gran rdzong in rGyal rong. He was a disciple of bSod nams g-yung drung, an abbot of sMan ri Monastery (No.1). While he was at sMan ri, he also received teachings from Tre ston bSod nams &rsquo;gyur med, Bru bla dBang rgyal, Zhu sgom Khri btsun and sTag dbra Nam mkha&rsquo; &rsquo;od zer. After completing his studies he began to practise meditation in many hermitages throughout Amdo and Khams and finally founded gTo lung Yang dben dpal dgon in gTo khog.<a href=\"#n30\" name=\"nb30\" class=\"note\">30</a> In his time, there were about a hundred monks in the monastery. It is said that there were two traditions of &rsquo;cham dances, one belonging to the monastery and the other to the residence of the head of the monastery (bla brang).</p> <p>rGyal rong gYung drung ye shes was succeeded by bla ma gYung drung bstan &rsquo;dzin who received teachings from many masters at sMan ri. The latter became the abbot of rGyal rong Monastery and founded a new monastery called gZhung ring (No. 160). During his time, lHa brtan Padma rnam rgyal, a dGe lugs pa master, came to gTo khog and succeeded in converting rGyal rong Monastery to the dGe lugs pa tradition. He renamed it dGa&rsquo; ldan phun tshogs gling. The new name was inscribed over the entrance of the assembly hall in which statues of the Jo rje &rsquo;brom gsum (Jo bo rje, rJe Tsong kha pa, &rsquo;Brom ston rGyal ba&rsquo;i &rsquo;byung gnas) were installed. However, when the king of Rab brtan was later defeated by the Manchu emperor Qianlong, the monastery reverted to the Bonpo tradition. </p> <p>Zla ba grags pa, the 23rd master, is said to have dissolved into a rainbow body (&rsquo;ja&rsquo; lus pa) when he died. The monastery was knocked down during the Cultural Revolution and was rebuilt by Rig &rsquo;dzin nor bu and Nam mkha&rsquo; &rsquo;od zer. </p> <h4 id=\"b6-8-10-4\">4.
