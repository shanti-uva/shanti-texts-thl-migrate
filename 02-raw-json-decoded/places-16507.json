This isolated hilltop has unobstructed views across the extensive <span class=\"popular\">Nyawo Tsangpo</span><span class=\"scholar\">Nya bo gtsang po</span> basin. On its summit there is a symmetrical arrangement of substantial rectilinear footings aligned in the cardinal directions. These footings are distributed over an area of 1000 m&sup2;. The symmetrical layout of these structures, their uniform design elements and analogous erosive qualities indicate that they were built in the same general time period. Four rectangular structures set in the compass points surround a much larger central structure. The well-built footings must have originally supported significant superstructures. The regular alignment and straightness of the foundations indicates the superstructures could only have supported wooden or semi-permanent roofs. The founding of an ancient facility at <span class=\"popular\">Domra</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sdom ra</span> can probably be explained by he presence of ideal winter grazing grounds and ample fresh water in the vicinity. Such natural endowments remain very important to the contemporary settlement. Stones used for construction were finished and are between 20 cm and 1 m in length. The ground plan and geographic aspect of <span class=\"popular\">Domra Dzong</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sdom ra rdzong</span> most resemble <span class=\"popular\">Dzongnak</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdzong nag</span> (A-2), located 60 km to the east in <span class=\"popular\">Sinya</span><span class=\"scholar\">Srin ya</span>, <span class=\"popular\">Shentsa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Shan rtsa</span> county.<a href=\"#n37\" name=\"nb37\" class=\"note\">37</a> </p> <h4 id=\"b1-1-26-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>According to native <span class=\"popular emph\">drok pa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">&rsquo;brog pa</span>, <span class=\"popular\">Domra</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sdom ra</span> is an ancient fortress. One elderly resident associated it with King <span class=\"popular\">Gesar</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ge sar</span>of the Tibetan epic. Another local account states that the builders tried to extend the walls higher and higher, but in the end they could not attain a height more than that of a goat.</p> <h4 id=\"b1-1-26-4\">Site elements</h4> <h5 id=\"b1-1-26-4-1\">Summit complex</h5> <h6 class=\"essay\">Outer structures</h6> <p>The southwest structure (8.4 m x 6 m) has all four foundation walls intact. They are around 60 cm thick. On he southeast corner of the structure there is a 1-m high rocky tumulus. The southeast structure (6.7 m x 6.5 m) has walls around 70 cm thick, which are elevated 30 cm to 80 cm above the surface of the summit. The northeast structure (7.7 m x 6.6 m) has a slightly elevated area (6.9 m x 4.6 m) within it, which is probably filled with rubble. The north wall of the northeast structure is 70 cm thick and elevated 40 cm above the ground surface. The northwest structure is of like construction and dimensions.</p> <h6 class=\"essay\">Inner structure</h6> <p>The central structure was located on the highest point of the summit. It covers an area of 29 m (east-west) x approximately 9 m (north-south), with an extension adding approximately 15 m&sup2;. The core central structure lies around 12 m from each of the four outer structures. Its south section has been leveled but the north section is still elevated on its southwest corner to a maximum height of 2 m. These walls are made of dry-mortar random-rubble. A wall running east-west bisects the north section of the inner structure. </p> <h5 id=\"b1-1-26-4-2\">Outlying structures</h5> <p>Forty-eight meters below the east edge of the summit is another foundation aligned in the compass points. It measures 17 m (east-west) x 4.4 m (north-south), and is partitioned into two sections. The better preserved east half has 60-cm thick walls, which protrude 40 cm to 80 cm above ground. </p> <hr class=\"footnote-divider\"/> <h2>Notes</h2> <div class=\"footnote\"> <a name=\"n37\"/> <a href=\"#nb37\" class=\"note\"> [37] </a> A description of <span class=\"popular\">Dzongnak</span><span class=\"scholar\">Rdzong nag</span> is found in John Vincent Bellezza, <em>Antiquities of Northern Tibet: Archaeological Discoveries on the High Plateau</em>.
