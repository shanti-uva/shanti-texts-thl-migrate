{"descriptions":[{"authors":[{"fullname":"David Germano","id":"2"}],"source_url":null,"content":"<p>The Sakya tradition remained more or less unitary until 1429, when the monastery of Ngor Evam Ch&ouml;den (ngor e bam chos ldan) was founded by the great Sakya scholar Ngorchen K&uuml;nga Zangpo (kun dga' bzang po, 1382-1444) in Tsang (gtsang) not far from Zhikats&eacute; (gzhis ka rtse). From this point on, Ngor emerged as a distinctive sub-sect with many monasteries considering themselves affiliated with Ngor rather than Sakya proper. This includes the famous Deg&eacute; G&ouml;nchen Lh&uuml;ndrup Teng (sde dge dgon chen lhun grub steng [?]) and its associated printery. Indeed, Ngor eventually emerged as the dynamic center of the Sakya tradition.
