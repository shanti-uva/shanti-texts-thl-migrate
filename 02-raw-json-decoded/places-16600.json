This probable all-stone building is so named for its location at the margin of the marshy valley bottom and the well-drained slopes of the adjoining ridge. The archaic design and construction of <span class=\"popular\">Taser Gok</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mtha&rsquo; ser gog</span> indicate that it was a <span class=\"popular emph\">do khang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rdo khang</span>, The structure is situated at the foot of a prominent red formation, approximately 3 km up valley from the contemporary village of <span class=\"popular\">T&ouml;nkha Lung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mthon kha lung</span>. The building faces east, the direction of the one exterior entryway. Significant exterior wall and interior partition segments are intact, reaching 1 m to 2 m in elevation. None of the roof appurtenances, however, have survived intact. The overall dimensions of the five-room edifice are 9.3 m (north-south) x 8.6 m (east-west). There is also a very poorly preserved small structural extension on the northeast side of the building. <span class=\"popular\">Taser Gok</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mtha&rsquo; ser gog</span> contains three rear/west rooms and two forward/east rooms divided from one another by a corridor. </p> <h4 id=\"b1-2-25-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>According to local elders, <span class=\"popular\">Taser Gok</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mtha&rsquo; ser gog</span> was being used as a retreat house several generations ago. </p> <h4 id=\"b1-2-25-4\">Site elements</h4> <h5 id=\"b1-2-25-4-1\">Residential complex</h5> <h6 class=\"essay\">Main edifice</h6> <p>The 60-cm- to 80-cm-thick walls of the main edifice are robust and somewhat irregular in plan. The mud-mortared, random-work walls are composed of both granite and dark gray metamorphic blocks and slabs. The stones are primarily 10 cm to 60 cm in length, and reach a maximum length of 1.3 m. Most of the exterior faces of the stones were cut flat. The exterior rear or west wall of the main edifice has a height of 1.5 m and an interior height of 2.3 m, illustrating the way in which the rear rooms were built into the slope, according hem a semi-subterranean aspect. The interior corners of the rooms are somewhat rounded, another common design feature of <span class=\"popular emph\">do khang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rdo khang</span> architecture. There are small areas of clay-based plaster remaining on the interior walls of the building, especially in the northwest room. There are also small traces of ochre tinted plaster on the exterior north wall.</p> <p>The northwest room (2.3 m x 4.4 m) of the rear tier is the largest in the main edifice (it may have been partially divided by a partition wall). The wall dividing the northwest and central west rooms of the rear ier (80 cm thick) still reaches its original height of 1.7 m in some places. This partition wall was massively constructed to support the great weight of a stone roof. There is a central corridor that runs between the rear and forward tier of rooms. This corridor is up to 1.5 m in width and directly connected to he outer entrance vestibule (1.3 m x 2.6 m). An approximately 70-cm wide entrance in the south wall of the corridor leads to the northwest room. The central west room (2.5 m x 3.2 m) of the rear tier appears to have been one undivided space. The southwest room (1.6 m x 4.4 m) of the rear tier may have been broken into east and west parts by a buttress that served as an intermediate load-bearing structure. The northeast room of the forward tier (2.6 m x 2.5 m) is particularly decrepit. The southeast room (2.4 m x 3.7 m) of the forward tier has its entrance in the north wall of the vestibule. The southeast room is bisected north-south by a 1.2-m long buttress, which helped to support the stone roof. </p> <h6 class=\"essay\">Outbound structures</h6> <p>Adjacent to the south side of the main edifice there is a now disused corral. Its construction was undoubtedly destructive to the religious center, which provided a ready source of building materials for the <span class=\"popular emph\">drok pa</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">&rsquo;brog pa</span> herders. Three meters north of the main <span class=\"popular emph\">do khang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rdo khang</span> there is a fragmentary foundation (4.4 m x 4 m). There may also be a small building foundation on the north side of the main edifice. There are the remains of a cubic shrine (1.1 m x 90 cm x 1 m) reposing on a slope, 14 m southwest of the main building This shrine was skillfully constructed of dressed stones and was mud mortared. There is a foundation of what appears to have been a building with two rooms (3 m x 7.5 m) situated 30 m uphill of the main edifice. It was built with a cliff as its backdrop. A forward wall segment in this structure reaches 1.2 m in height. There is some structural evidence to indicate that a wall followed the line of the slope south of the main edifice and this upper level structure. </p> <h6 class=\"essay\"> Buddhist shrines</h6> <p>A wall with inscribed plaques is found immediately west or upslope of the main <span class=\"popular emph\">do khang</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">rdo khang</span>. There are still many old carved stones at this shrine. Some distance down valley of <span class=\"popular\">Taser Gok</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mtha&rsquo; ser gog</span> here is a ruined <span class=\"popular emph\">Ch&ouml;rten</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mchod rten</span>. It was also built on the left edge of the valley and is composed of dark gray metamorphic stones. </p> <h5 id=\"b1-2-25-4-2\">mthon kha lung agriculture</h5> <p>In the contemporary period, cultivation is carried out in the lower reaches of the <span class=\"popular\">T&ouml;nkha Lung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mthon kha lung</span> valley. This agriculture, however, is minimal and many fields lie fallow each year. It would appear that more intensive agriculture was practiced when the valley&rsquo;s water was in more plentiful supply.</p> <table cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\" class=\"navarrows\"> <tbody> <tr> <td class=\"leftcell\"> <a class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-left.gif\" title=\"Previous Section\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"midcell\"> <a class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-up.gif\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"rightcell\"> <a class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-right.gif\" title=\"Next Section\"/> </a> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div id=\"chap-id\">/bellezza/b1-2-25/</div> <div style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\" class=\"jqmWindow\" id=\"chapRefWindow\"> <div class=\"closebtn\"> <a href=\"#\">Close</a> </div> <div style=\"height: 280px;\" class=\"conx-content\"> <h3>Note Citation for Page <span class=\"pgnm\"/> </h3> <p class=\"biblref\">John Vincent Bellezza, Antiquities of Zhang Zhung: A Comprehensive Inventory of Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Monuments on he Tibetan Upland (Charlottesville, VA 22904:Tibetan &amp; Himalayan Library, 2010), <span class=\"pgnm\"/>. </p> <h3>Bibliographic Citation</h3> <p>John Vincent Bellezza.
