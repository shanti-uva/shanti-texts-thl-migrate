This prominence is reinforced by the conspicuous location of the array and edifice on the margins of the large plain.

The existence of the three common Upper Tibetan pillar typologies at one site, underscores the integral nature of these monuments in an architectural, cognitive and ritual sense. By virtue of these monuments being found together, it can be surmised that they had complimentary functions. The integrated nature of the various monumental components of the site may also indicate hat they were built and used within the same timeframe.

This structure is aligned in the cardinal directions, and measures 5.2 m (east-west) x 16.7 m (north-south). The poorly preserved edifice is elevated about 1 m above the surrounding plain. Originally, it would have been substantially taller. A tiny coherent wall fragment is found in the exterior north face of the edifice. Another intact wall fragment is part of the inner west wall of the edifice. A slight depression on top of the edifice marks the location of the central chamber. Evidence from other sites of the same typology suggests that the central chamber was flanked by very heavily constructed walls. Variable-length (up to 60 cm long) stones were used in the construction of the temple-tomb. \u003c/p\u003e \u003ch6 class=\"essay\"\u003eArray of Pillars\u003c/h6\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe array is aligned in the cardinal direction, as is often the case in this monument typology. The array approximately measures 16 m (north-south) x 16.7 m (east-west). The west half of the array of pillars has been obliterated. The east-west dimensions provided are between the most outlying row of pillars and the east wall of the appended edifice. Originally, there were roughly 20 east-west oriented rows of pillars in the array. There are still around 130 standing stones, less than 15 percent of the original number. As intact lines of pillars are spaced 30 cm to 50 cm apart (with wider spacings more common), it can be extrapolated that there were no less than 1000 standing stones in the array. All of the brown sandstone pillars are highly eroded and extremely weathered. Most of the in situ pillars are tabular but there are also four-sided and irregularly shaped specimens, especially among the smaller ones. The broad sides of the tabular pillars are oriented north and south. There are 26 larger pillars (40 cm and 60 cm high), which are mostly concentrated on the east side of the array. Some uprooted specimens up to 70 cm in length lie about the concourse. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe east side of the array of pillars is bordered by a single-course slab wall. A northern fragment of this wall is 8.4 m long. This wall is composed of slabs 15 cm to 60 cm in length, which are only around 1 cm in hickness. These slabs are flush with the ground surface or slightly project above it. There are also three east-west running double-course slab-wall fragments bordering and inside the pillar concourse. The parallel courses of slabs are spaced 20 cm to 30 apart. These three double-course walls are highly fragmentary and heir original configuration and lengths could not be determined. The most intact of these wall fragments (3.3 m long) is found on the north side of the pillar array. The double-course wall fragment bordering the south side of the pillar array is 2.9 m in length. On its west end there is a connecting double-course wall 90 cm in length that runs perpendicular. Little pieces of milky quartz in small amounts are scattered around the array of pillars. These stones must have been used in the ornamentation of the site. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThere is an isolated small group of pillars situated 8.5 m south of the temple tomb. These pillars are up to 65 cm in height. They are planted in the ground with no discernable pattern. A square slab-wall structure (1 m x 1 m) is found 5.2 m east of the main pillar array. It is composed of pairs of slabs (50 cm to 1 m in length) arranged side by side, which were inserted into the ground edgewise. These slabs project as much as 30 cm above the ground surface.

It consists of a lone pillar (60 cm high) probably erected on the perimeter wall of another enclosure. There appear to be other funerary structures in the proximity of FS3, but there is not enough structural detritus visible to know for certain. The disintegration of FS3 and sister structures was largely caused by water-borne damage to the site (marked by gullies and depositions). The construction of a tent site (\u003cspan class=\"popular emph\"\u003enangra\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"scholar emph\"\u003enang ra\u003c/span\u003e) and a corral (\u003cspan class=\"popular emph\"\u003elhara\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"scholar emph\"\u003elhas ra\u003c/span\u003e) in the vicinity may also have impacted FS3. \u003c/p\u003e \u003ch5 id=\"b2-1-75-4-3\"\u003eSlab-wall network (Site 2)\u003c/h5\u003e \u003ch6 class=\"essay\"\u003eSlab walls\u003c/h6\u003e \u003cp\u003eSite 2 is situated roughly 400 m west of the array of pillars (4510 m).

The south wall (9 m long) consists of parallel courses of slabs set about 1 m apart. This incomplete wall is partitioned in eight spots by single slabs placed at right angles, creating eight discrete box-like structures. The brown sandstone slabs used in construction are up to 95 cm in length and were embedded in the ground edgewise. These slabs are level with the ground surface or are elevated as much as 20 cm above it. The fragmentary middle wall (6.1 m long) and north wall (1.4 m long) are designed and built in the same fashion as the south wall. These three walls span an 8.6-m transverse section of the slope. A similarly constructed wall (7 m long) that runs north-south (perpendicular to the axis of the slope) is situated 2 m south of the south wall. All the walls of Site 2 are likely to have had a funerary ritual rather than a burial function. \u003c/p\u003e \u003ch6 class=\"essay\"\u003eFunerary Structure FS4\u003c/h6\u003e \u003cp\u003eA funerary structure is situated 14 m west/uphill of FS3. This structure is aligned in the cardinal directions, and measures 3.6 m (east-west) x 5 m (north-south). The forward side of this well-built structure is elevated about 1 m above the slope, while the rear side is flush with the slope. There are small intact double-course masonry fragments along the sides and rear of the structure. They are composed of as many as hree vertical courses of blocks and slabs laid flat.

Site 3 occupies a similar aspect to Site 2: a slightly inclined flat at the edge of the slope. The sandy errain is strewn with pieces of sandstone. The highly worn four-sided sandstone pillar is 1.4 m in height and has a basal girth of 1 m. It is heavily tilted in an east/downhill direction.

Immediately above it there is another walled terrace, which measures 16 m (north-south) x 5.5 m (east-west). It also appears to have been divided by two partitions walls into three units. Portions of the walled upper terrace are composed of upright slabs.

The double-course perimeter walls in most places are around 70 cm in thickness.

The north wall is composed of slabs of as many as four vertical courses of masonry. The north wall is elevated 30 cm above the adjoining terrain. The double-course south wall is flush with the ground surface and appears to consist of only one layer of flat slabs. The west wall and south portion of the east wall are composed of double-course upright slabs. These slabs project as much as 20 cm above the surface.

They were established in a small sandy hollow, bisected by a gully. They include a complete enclosure (1.3 m x 60 cm) composed of stones flush with the ground surface or rising above it slightly. There is also a partial enclosure measuring 2.8 m across. Finally, there is an enclosure (3.5 m x 3.5 m) that appears to have both single-course and double-course perimeter walls. The stones in the perimeter walls of this latter specimen are level with the ground surface or project above it to a height of 20 cm. \u003c/p\u003e \u003chr class=\"footnote-divider\"/\u003e \u003ch2\u003eNotes\u003c/h2\u003e \u003cdiv class=\"footnote\"\u003e \u003ca name=\"n45\"/\u003e \u003ca href=\"#nb45\" class=\"note\"\u003e [45] \u003c/a\u003e Just two days before the survey (October 11, 2002), local \u003cspan class=\"popular emph\"\u003edrok pa\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"scholar emph\"\u003e\u0026rsquo;brog pa\u003c/span\u003e report that two men of the Hui ethnic nationality asked them if they could dig at the site.
