This is another site of quadrate funerary mounds of the kind commonly found in the area (see D-4, D-99, D-100, D-102). These structures have a southern aspect. In recent years, three of the six <span class=\"popular emph\">bangso</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">bang so</span> of <span class=\"popular\">Chumikdo La Ts&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Chu mig mdo la btsas</span> have been destroyed by looters. It is rumored that a ceramic pot containing patterned agates was discovered on the site and sold in <span class=\"popular\">Lhasa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Lha sa</span>. This find appears to have unleashed a digging frenzy on the part of local residents. The result of this illicit activity is the loss of much of the scientific value of <span class=\"popular\">Chumikdo La Ts&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Chu mig mdo la btsas</span>. In relatively heavily populated and accessible <span class=\"popular\">Damzhung</span><span class=\"scholar\">&rsquo;Dam gzhung</span> grave robbing is a growing problem. Thus far, little or nothing has been done by local or provincial authorities to curb this problem, putting at extreme risk what remains of the region&rsquo;s archaeological heritage. </p> <h4 id=\"b2-2-64-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>According to local sources, <span class=\"popular\">Chumikdo La Ts&eacute;</span><span class=\"scholar\">Chu mig mdo la btsas</span> is an ancient burial ground. </p> <h4 id=\"b2-2-64-4\">Site elements</h4> <h5 id=\"b2-2-64-4-1\">Upper sector</h5> <p>Funerary structures FS1 to FS4 are situated on <span class=\"popular emph\">drama</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">gra ma</span>-studded, steep slopes 30 m to 50 m above the edge of the <span class=\"popular\">Dam</span><span class=\"scholar\">&rsquo;Dam</span> basin. These structures have the following dimensions and characteristics:</p> <ol> <li>Funerary structure FS1 has been completely eliminated through excavation (30&deg; 34.676&#900; N. lat. / 91&deg; 12.440&#900; E. long. / 4340 m). This excavation measures 4 m x 4 m and is 1 m deep on its uphill side. The stones removed from the dig were cast down the slope, indicating that the excavation of FS1 was solely a matter of grave robbing. </li> <li>Funerary structure FS2 (6 m x 7 m) has a rear/north flank 1.5 m in height and a downhill/north flank 2 m or more in height (34.702&#900; / 12.439&#900; / 4360 m). This highly eroded mound has <span class=\"popular emph\">drama</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">gra ma</span> brush growing on it. </li> <li>Funerary structure FS3 (4.5 m x 5.5 m) has an uphill height of about 1 m and a downhill height of around 2 m (34.703&#900; / 12.458&#900; / 4360 m). This structure is highly eroded and has lost much of its original shape. <span class=\"popular emph\">drama</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">gra ma </span>brush grows on FS3.</li> <li>Funerary structure FS4 (4 m x 4 m) has been nearly leveled by looters (34.703&#900; / 12.461&#900; / 4360 m). </li> </ol> <h5 id=\"b2-2-64-4-2\">Lower sector</h5> <p>Funerary structures FS5 and FS6 are situated at the base of the slope.</p> <h6 class=\"essay\">Funerary Structure FS5</h6> <p>Funerary structure FS5 has been nearly removed by looters (34.626 / 12.420&#900; / 4310 m). It is only through local information that one would know of its existence, as so little in situ structural evidence remains. The destruction of this funerary mound required the removal of many cubic meters of earth and rock. In an outer wall fragment (3 m high) there are many embedded bones. Quite easily the survey team found a sheep mandible in he surface of the structure. </p> <h6 class=\"essay\">Funerary Structure FS6</h6> <p>Funerary structure FS6 has been destroyed through wholesale excavation (34.624&#900; / 12.388&#900; / 4310 m). Up to 4 m vertical of earth and stones were removed to create a large gaping hole in the ground. </p> <table cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\" class=\"navarrows\"> <tbody> <tr> <td class=\"leftcell\"> <a class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-left.gif\" title=\"Previous Section\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"midcell\"> <a class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-up.gif\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"rightcell\"> <a class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-right.gif\" title=\"Next Section\"/> </a> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div id=\"chap-id\">/bellezza2/b2-2-64/</div> <div style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\" class=\"jqmWindow\" id=\"chapRefWindow\"> <div class=\"closebtn\"> <a href=\"#\">Close</a> </div> <div style=\"height: 280px;\" class=\"conx-content\"> <h3>Note Citation for Page <span class=\"pgnm\"/> </h3> <p class=\"biblref\">John Vincent Bellezza, Antiquities of Zhang Zhung: A Comprehensive Inventory of Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Monuments on he Tibetan Upland (Charlottesville, VA 22904:Tibetan &amp; Himalayan Library, 2010), <span class=\"pgnm\"/>. </p> <h3>Bibliographic Citation</h3> <p>John Vincent Bellezza.
