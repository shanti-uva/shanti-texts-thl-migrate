The vistas to the north and east are particularly wide open. The shelf declines in an eastern direction, forcing the downhill walls of the heaped-stone wall enclosures to be elevated in order to maintain level interiors. The walls of these rounded enclosures consist of stones heaped to a height of 60 cm. The heaped-stone walls are as much as 1 m to 2 m thick, reflecting a great deal of subsidence over the centuries. Stones are strewn around the site while adjoining areas of the same shelf are free of such debris. This probably indicates that these loose stones were once part of the superstructures. The rocky backbone of <span class=\"popular\">Rirung</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ri rung</span>, the probable source of stones for the construction of <span class=\"popular\">Rirung M&ouml;ndur</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ri rung mon dur</span>, is situated west of the site. The structures are made from variable-length (20 cm to 1 m long) stones. These stones are light-colored with a dark grain and have acquired a reddish varnish. There is a small corral on the site which was probably built with stones pilfered from the monuments. </p> <h4 id=\"b2-2-10-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p> <span class=\"popular\">Rirung M&ouml;ndur</span><span class=\"scholar\">Ri rung mon dur</span> is attributed by local sources to the ancient <span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span>.</p> <h4 id=\"b2-2-10-4\">Site elements</h4> <p>From south to north, the characteristics of the three superstructures are as follows:</p> <ol> <li>Funerary structure FS1 (19 m long) is kidney shaped and has a level interior. The uphill wall is sunken about 60 cm into the ground and the downhill wall is raised a like amount in order to create a level interior. The interior is free from visible structural elements.</li> <li>Funerary structure FS2 (6 m long) is located 17 m northwest of FS1. This is an irregularly shaped enclosure with single-course perimeter walls. The stones in the enclosure are up to 90 cm in length and project as much as 35 cm from the surface of the ground.</li> <li>Funerary structure FS3 (17 m across) is situated 7 m northwest of FS2. This heaped-stone wall enclosure is nearly round. Like FS1, its uphill wall is set prominently into the ground, while its downhill wall is elevated in order to create a level interior. The interior is free from visible structural elements.</li> <li>Funerary structure FS4 (19 m across) is located 32 m northwest of FS3. This ovoid heaped-stone wall specimen may have been divided into two cells by a heaped-stone wall. </li> </ol> <table cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\" class=\"navarrows\"> <tbody> <tr> <td class=\"leftcell\"> <a class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-left.gif\" title=\"Previous Section\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"midcell\"> <a class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-up.gif\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"rightcell\"> <a class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-right.gif\" title=\"Next Section\"/> </a> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div id=\"chap-id\">/bellezza2/b2-2-10/</div> <div style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\" class=\"jqmWindow\" id=\"chapRefWindow\"> <div class=\"closebtn\"> <a href=\"#\">Close</a> </div> <div style=\"height: 280px;\" class=\"conx-content\"> <h3>Note Citation for Page <span class=\"pgnm\"/> </h3> <p class=\"biblref\">John Vincent Bellezza, Antiquities of Zhang Zhung: A Comprehensive Inventory of Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Monuments on he Tibetan Upland (Charlottesville, VA 22904:Tibetan &amp; Himalayan Library, 2010), <span class=\"pgnm\"/>. </p> <h3>Bibliographic Citation</h3> <p>John Vincent Bellezza.
