Name</h4> <p>The monastery&rsquo;s full name is sNang zhig rGyal bstan phun tshogs gling, and is also known as sNang zhig bKra shis g-yung drung gling, or sNang zhig Phyogs las rnam rgyal bkra shis g-yung drung gling.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-12-3-2\">2. Location</h4> <p>The monastery is located 5 km north of rNga ba Township, the seat of rNga ba county. There is a motorable road leading to the monastery.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-12-3-3\">3. History</h4> <p>The first in the succession of the sNang zhig masters is said to be Do &rsquo;phags chen po, also known as Yon tan rgyal mtshan (b.1168).<a href=\"#n55\" name=\"nb55\" class=\"note\">55</a> Although the latter was responsible for spreading Bon in the area and opened several hermitages in rNga khog, the real founder of the monastery was Nyi ma &rsquo;dzin, the eldest son of Do &rsquo;phags chen po. The first building of the establishment was Nyi ma &rsquo;dzin&rsquo;s own residence (bla brang) built in 1108 and known as rGyal bstan phun tshogs gling. </p> <p>Do &rsquo;phags chen po and sKyang za g-yu sgron had three sons: Nyi ma &rsquo;dzin, &rsquo;Dul ba rgyal mtshan, and gYung drung rgyal mtshan. Nyi ma &rsquo;dzin studied under the feet of Zhu sgom &rsquo;phrul zhig, but his two brothers &rsquo;Dul ba rgyal mtshan and gYung drung rgyal mtshan migrated to Shar khog where the former founded the monastery lCags mdud bKra shis g-yung drung gling (No.199), and the latter a monastery known as sNang zhig dngul sku (No.201). </p> <p>The descendants of the three brothers were collectively known as the &ldquo;three lineages of sNang zhig&rdquo; (sNang zhig khag gsum). The twenty-fourth descendant of the eldest brother, sNang zhig Tshul khrims dbang mchog, took monastic vows. He then divided the establishment of sNang zhig rGyal bstan phun tshogs gling into two settlements: one for lay tantric practitioners and the other for monks. </p> <p>Following is a list of the sNang zhig lineage masters: </p> <ol type=\"1\"> <li>Do &rsquo;phags chen po (sNang zhig Yon tan rgyal mtshan </li> <li>Nyi ma &rsquo;dzin </li> <li>lHun grub rgyal mtshan </li> <li>Kun dga&rsquo; rgyal mtshan </li> <li>Nam mkha&rsquo; rgyal mtshan </li> <li>Zla ba rgyal mtshan </li> <li>Yon tan rgyal mtshan </li> <li>Kun dga&rsquo; lhun grub </li> <li>Shes rab rgyal mtshan </li> <li>lHun grub rgyal mtshan </li> <li>Shes rab &rsquo;od zer </li> <li>Chags med bya bral </li> <li>bstan pa rgyal mtshan </li> <li>Tshul khrims rgyal mtshan </li> <li>Ye shes rgyal mtshan </li> <li>bSod nams rgyal mtshan </li> <li>lHun grub dbang ldan </li> <li>bsTan pa tshul khrims </li> <li>Rin chen lhun grub </li> <li>Shes rab rgyal ba </li> <li>Nam mkha&rsquo; rgyal mtshan </li> <li>Shes rab dbang rgyal </li> <li>Tshe dbang rgyal mtshan </li> <li>Tshul khrims dbang mchog </li> <li>bsTan pa tshul khrims </li> <li>bsTan pa lhun grub </li> <li>Shes rab blo gros </li> <li>Tshul khrims bstan &rsquo;dzin </li> <li>Rin chen rgyal mtshan, </li> <li>gYung drung bstan pa dar rgyas, he founded gDong li Monastery (No.179)</li> <li>bSod nams rgyal mtshan </li> <li>bsTan &rsquo;dzin dbang rgyal </li> <li>Phun tshogs rnam rgyal </li> <li>Blo gros thogs med </li> <li>gYung drung bstan pa&rsquo;i nyi ma </li> <li>Grub dbang g-yung drung bstan &rsquo;dzin </li> <li>Nam mkha&rsquo; blo gros </li> <li>bsTan pa rab rgyas (1929-1961)</li> <li>bsKal bzang blo gros rgya mtsho (b.1983)</li> </ol> <p>The monastery was destroyed during the Cultural Revolution and its reconstruction was undertaken in 1980 by rGya &rsquo;obs bsTan &rsquo;dzin dbang rgyal and Slob zur Tshul khrims bstan &rsquo;dzin.</p> <h4 id=\"b6-12-3-4\">4.
