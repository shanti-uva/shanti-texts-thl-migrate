The majority of these enclosures and the subsurface graves have been recently dismantled to feed the local appetite for building stones. It is widely reported at <span class=\"popular\">J iu</span><span class=\"scholar\">Byi&rsquo;u</span> that many of these funerary structures contained human bones, which were indiscriminately discarded. The wholesale destruction of the <span class=\"popular\">J iu</span><span class=\"scholar\">Byi&rsquo;u</span> funerary monuments, a function of greed and ignorance, is a significant cultural loss. Wrought by the Tibetans themselves, this comes on top of the highly destructive Chinese Cultural Revolution. Only the remains of five so-called <span class=\"popular emph\">m&ouml;n do</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mon rdo</span> still lend themselves to documentation. </p> <h4 id=\"b2-2-21-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>According to residents of <span class=\"popular\">J iu</span><span class=\"scholar\">Byi&rsquo;u</span>, the tombs of byi&rsquo;u mon dur contain the remains of the ancient <span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span>.</p> <h4 id=\"b2-2-21-4\">Site elements</h4> <h5 id=\"b2-2-21-4-1\">Funerary Structure FS1</h5> <p>Funerary structure FS1 is situated near the northern-most line of <span class=\"popular emph\">ch&ouml; ten</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mchod-rten</span> at <span class=\"popular\">Jiu G&ouml;npa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Byi&rsquo;u dgon pa</span> (30&deg; 46.031 N. lat. / 81&deg; 21.993&#900; E. long.). It is found on sloping ground in the vicinity of where a couple of contemporary residences have come up. FS1 has been totally destroyed. Reportedly, the excavation of this structure turned up charcoal at about 1 m in depth. At 60 cm deep a ceramic vessel (35 cm across) was smashed during the excavation. A large portion of this vessel was still in situ at the time of the survey.</p> <h5 id=\"b2-2-21-4-2\">Funerary Structure FS2 </h5> <p>Funerary structure FS2 is situated north of <span class=\"popular\">Jiu G&ouml;npa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Byi&rsquo;u dgon pa</span> on the lower flanks of a hillside, in close proximity to FS1. FS2 has been reduced to a double-course wall fragment 80 cm in length and around 25 cm thick (46.048&#900; / 22.003&#900;). It is composed of variable-length pebbles (2 cm to 7 cm long) embedded into the ground. It is reported that human skeletal remains were discovered in the ground at this location. </p> <h5 id=\"b2-2-21-4-3\">Funerary Structure FS3</h5> <p>Funerary structure FS3 (8.5 m x 6 m) is situated in a sandy and grassy plain approximately 1 km north of <span class=\"popular\">J iu</span><span class=\"scholar\">Byi&rsquo;u</span> (46.322&#900; / 22.154&#900;). It consists of a rectangular single-course enclosure subdivided into at least two cells of unequal size. FS3 is composed of stones up to 85 cm in length. The stones of the enclosing walls protrude a maximum of 20 cm above the ground surface.</p> <h5 id=\"b2-2-21-4-4\">Funerary Structure FS4</h5> <p>Funerary structure FS4 (6.5 m x 2.7 m) is situated in close proximity to FS3 (46.334&#900; / 22.170&#900;). Adjacent to his enclosure there is a small area of various wall segments. These structures are primarily composed of variable length (20 cm to 40 cm) slabs embedded in the ground edgewise. These slabs are flush with the surface or rise above the ground level to a maximum height of 15 cm.</p> <h5 id=\"b2-2-21-4-5\">Funerary Structure FS5</h5> <p>Reportedly, the superstructure of FS5 was dismantled in 2002 (46.491&#900; / 22.112&#900;). There are cavities in the ground where the stones of the enclosing walls were extracted. </p> <table cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\" class=\"navarrows\"> <tbody> <tr> <td class=\"leftcell\"> <a class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-left.gif\" title=\"Previous Section\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"midcell\"> <a class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-up.gif\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"rightcell\"> <a class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-right.gif\" title=\"Next Section\"/> </a> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div id=\"chap-id\">/bellezza2/b2-2-21/</div> <div style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\" class=\"jqmWindow\" id=\"chapRefWindow\"> <div class=\"closebtn\"> <a href=\"#\">Close</a> </div> <div style=\"height: 280px;\" class=\"conx-content\"> <h3>Note Citation for Page <span class=\"pgnm\"/> </h3> <p class=\"biblref\">John Vincent Bellezza, Antiquities of Zhang Zhung: A Comprehensive Inventory of Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Monuments on he Tibetan Upland (Charlottesville, VA 22904:Tibetan &amp; Himalayan Library, 2010), <span class=\"pgnm\"/>. </p> <h3>Bibliographic Citation</h3> <p>John Vincent Bellezza.
