There appear to be the remains of five cubic tombs in two different groups on the summit of sgom &lsquo;khor. Two specimens were rehabilitated to serve as <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma &#7751;i</span> walls. <span class=\"popular\">Gonkhor</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sgom &rsquo;khor</span> is well known in the <span class=\"popular\">Zhungpa</span><span class=\"scholar\">Gzhung pa</span> region for its many <span class=\"popular emph\">ma i</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma &#7747;i</span> walls, built as acts of devotion by local residents in pre-modern times. Since the 1980s many of these shrines have been rebuilt. Uncut reddish and bluish volcanic stone slabs (mostly between 30 cm and 50 cm in length) were used to construct the ombs and to refurbish them for use as walls to support <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma &#7751;i</span> plaques. </p> <h4 id=\"b2-3-6-3\">Oral tradition</h4> <p>According to elder residents of <span class=\"popular\">Gonkhor</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sgom &rsquo;khor</span>, hese structures are the remains of ancient <span class=\"popular\">M&ouml;n</span><span class=\"scholar\">Mon</span> tombs, which were converted into Buddhist shrines long before living memory. </p> <h4 id=\"b2-3-6-4\">Site elements</h4> <h5 id=\"b2-3-6-4-1\">Middle summit</h5> <p>In the middle of the flat summit there appear to be the remains of two cubic tombs spaced 6 m apart (31&deg; 50.403&#900; N. lat. / 82&deg; 04.023&#900; / E. long. / 4710 m). One of these specimens measures 2 m x 2 m x 50 cm. The other specimen has been reduced to a mound with no coherent features. </p> <h5 id=\"b2-3-6-4-2\">Edge of the summit</h5> <p>Some tens of meters to the north, two or three more cubic tombs are situated on the edge of the mesa-like summit overlooking the settlement of <span class=\"popular\">Gonkhor</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sgom &rsquo;khor</span> (50.534&#900; / 04.112&#900; / 4700 m). These structures are situated about 3 m apart from one another. The largest specimen (2 m x 1.8 m x 1.2 m) appears to have some of its central depository intact. On op of this structure there are pieces of old plaques with worn <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma &#7751;i</span> inscriptions, creating a shrine that was built in pre-modern times. The design, construction and location of this structure corroborate its <span class=\"popular emph\">m&ouml;n dur</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">mon dur</span> attribution in the local oral tradition. It is longer and the stonework is of generally higher quality than the purpose-built <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma &#7751;i</span> walls of <span class=\"popular\">Gonkhor</span><span class=\"scholar\">Sgom &rsquo;khor</span>. The morphology of a second specimen, used to enshrine <span class=\"popular emph\">Mani</span><span class=\"scholar emph\">ma &#7751;i</span> plaques, does not permit positive identification as a cubic tomb. The third specimen (1.6 m x 1.9 m) has been nearly leveled. </p> <table cellspacing=\"8\" align=\"center\" class=\"navarrows\"> <tbody> <tr> <td class=\"leftcell\"> <a class=\"backarrow\" title=\"Previous Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-left.gif\" title=\"Previous Section\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"midcell\"> <a class=\"uparrow\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-up.gif\" title=\"Beginning of Article\"/> </a> </td> <td class=\"rightcell\"> <a class=\"forwardarrow\" title=\"Next Section\"> <img src=\"/global/images/arrow-right.gif\" title=\"Next Section\"/> </a> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div id=\"chap-id\">/bellezza2/b2-3-6/</div> <div style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 300px;\" class=\"jqmWindow\" id=\"chapRefWindow\"> <div class=\"closebtn\"> <a href=\"#\">Close</a> </div> <div style=\"height: 280px;\" class=\"conx-content\"> <h3>Note Citation for Page <span class=\"pgnm\"/> </h3> <p class=\"biblref\">John Vincent Bellezza, Antiquities of Zhang Zhung: A Comprehensive Inventory of Pre-Buddhist Archaeological Monuments on he Tibetan Upland (Charlottesville, VA 22904:Tibetan &amp; Himalayan Library, 2010), <span class=\"pgnm\"/>. </p> <h3>Bibliographic Citation</h3> <p>John Vincent Bellezza.
