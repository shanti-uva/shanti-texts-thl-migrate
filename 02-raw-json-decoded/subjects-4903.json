{"descriptions":[{"id":1211,"title":null,"content":"\u003cp class=\"Paragraph\"\u003eMoods are conveyed by auxiliary verbs (or by copulas), and have the function of specifying \u003cstrong\u003ethe source of information\u003c/strong\u003e on which a statement is based. There are basically four moods:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e1. Egophoric\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e2. Testimonial\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e3. Assertive\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e4. Inferential\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class=\"Paragraph\"\u003eThese moods all correspond to any statement that conveys a given item of information. They are essential in Central Tibetan, and appear in different forms in several other Tibetan dialects (Dzongkha, Ladakhi, Kham, Amdo, Sherpa, etc.). However, they are practically nonexistent in Literary Tibetan.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class=\"Paragraph\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1. Egophoric Mood\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class=\"Paragraph\"\u003eThe egophoric mood is linked to a personal knowledge or intention on the speaker\u0026rsquo;s part. It is associated only with the first person (singular or plural).\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class=\"Paragraph\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2. Testimonial Mood\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class=\"Paragraph\"\u003eTestimonial or \u0026ldquo;sensorial\u0026rdquo; auxiliaries such as\u003cspan class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\"\u003e འདུག་ \u003c/span\u003esignify that the speaker \u003cstrong\u003ehas personally observed\u003c/strong\u003e the fact or event he or she is reporting. The evidence is usually derived from the senses, most commonly sight or hearing. When it is used in reported speech, it implies that one observed the original source of the assertion.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class=\"Paragraph\"\u003eIn short, the testimonial indicates that the speaker is, or has been, a direct witness to what he or she is describing. The assertive and testimonial moods could be described as respectively objective and subjective, but as far as the speaker is concerned they are equally certain.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class=\"Paragraph\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3. Assertive Mood\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class=\"Paragraph\"\u003eThe assertive auxiliary verbs\u003cspan class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\"\u003e རེད་\u003c/span\u003e and \u003cspan class=\"tibetan\" title=\"Type ID here\"\u003eཡོད་རེད་ \u003c/span\u003especify that the information being transmitted may be\u003cstrong\u003e a general truth\u003c/strong\u003e or\u003cstrong\u003e a specific fact\u003c/strong\u003e, but is something that is considered by the speaker to be \u003cstrong\u003ecertain\u003c/strong\u003e. In general, the assertive implies that the speaker is letting it be known that while the assertion is certain, he or she has not personally witnessed it. Typically, the information has been obtained second-hand from some other source (reported speech, a book, the radio, etc.) or else forms a part of the speaker\u0026rsquo;s general knowledge.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class=\"Paragraph\"\u003eHowever, it may happen that even though the speaker can personally testify to the validity of the assertion, he or she may use the assertive in order to present the statement as an objective or well-known fact.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class=\"Paragraph\"\u003eNote: The assertive mood should not be confused with the marker of reported speech, which may be used in combination with any of the four moods, and implies a measure of uncertainty (\u0026ldquo;It would seem that\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;).\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class=\"Paragraph\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e4. Inferential Mood\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class=\"Paragraph\"\u003eFinally, the inferential mood indicates that the basis of the speaker\u0026rsquo;s assertion is an inference or a conclusion that is being drawn from the traces or the present results of a past action.\u003c/p\u003e","source_url":null,"is_primary":true,"created_at":"2013-09-15 04:14:26 UTC","updated_at":"2013-09-15 04:14:26 UTC","authors":[{"id":"6","fullname":"Nicolas Tournadre"}]}]}
